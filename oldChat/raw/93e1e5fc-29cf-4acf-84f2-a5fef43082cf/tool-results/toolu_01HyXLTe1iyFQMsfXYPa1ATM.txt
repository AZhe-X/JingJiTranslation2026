**KEEP "impels."**

I was wrong to flag it. The Chinese is genuinely different: 推动 (push/drive) in the footnote is stronger than 想要 (want to) in the body. The translator correctly matched register to source — "impels" for 推动, "moves me to want to" for 使得我想要. Harmonizing would erase a real distinction in the original.

Good catch on the different source texts.

**CONFIRM.** All six points approved. The 德 split is the right call -- "virtue" carries the semantic weight needed for the philosophical experiment in the block quote, and "(constitutive) character" / "character" captures the author's constructivist reinterpretation in the analysis.

1. **道 → "the Way"** — throughout (lines 34, 36, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48). Confirmed.
2. **德 → split** — "virtue" in block quote (line 34), "character" in analysis (lines 40, 44, 46). TN3 marks the transition. Confirmed.

## 1. THE AUTHOR'S OWN DEFINITION

The most critical evidence is that the author explicitly defines 感受 in two places:

Hard because: (1) the experiential pacing cannot be rearranged — the argument IS the rhythm, so normal editorial tools are off-limits; (2) five registers coexist and the transitions between them are philosophical arguments, not just style shifts; (3) "phenomenal X" compounds are 6-8 syllables in English versus 3 in Chinese, creating density I can only manage

2,311 words is right. It sits comfortably in the standard range for a philosophically complex translation (1,500-3,000), and every section now earns its space. The only section I would have considered cutting further — the new structural claims paragraph (lines 50-51) — actually adds useful conceptual footholds. No further trimming needed.

Let me chronologically analyze this conversation, which is a continuation of a multi-session translation project for 境集 (Jing Ji).

The conversation begins with extensive system reminders showing previously read files (Translator's Preface, Profile.md, Essay4 draft, Essay 8 source) and a detailed summary of the previous session's work.

**Vote: YES**

This is exactly right, and it follows directly from the principle I flagged in my original profile proposal: "they should NOT know what 'experiential sequences' are or that the collection is designed to produce specific experiences. They should read naively. If they are told in advance 'this passage is designed to make you feel X,' the experiment is contaminated.

Reasoning: The bias concern is well-founded and directly relevant to the profile's own Tier 1 requirement ("No prior exposure... You must encounter the collection cold").
