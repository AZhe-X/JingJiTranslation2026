*Final review: Preface + Afterword blueprint — confirm or advise*

**Final review round.** Please read both documents and respond with **CONFIRM** or **ADVICE** (with specific suggestion):

1. **Translator's Preface (DRAFT-R3):**
`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Draft/Translators-Preface.md`

2. **Afterword Blueprint (updated):**
`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Editor/Afterword-Blueprint.md`

Check both for completeness, accuracy, and anything missing from your domain. This is the final check before we move on.

CONFIRM on both documents. The Preface is clean and spoiler-free. The Afterword Blueprint is comprehensive and accurate from the metaphysics perspective. One advisory note for the drafter: include the Four Kinds of Metaphysics (第〇/一/二/三种形而上) in Section A as the mechanism behind the "bottom-up construction" claim. Not blocking. Ready to move on.
