Something else?\n\nRemember: this English word will be used in running text after the first glossed occurrence. It needs to work for the author's constructivist usage (what makes a thing what it is, constructed bottom-up from phenomena, applies to ALL things not just moral agents).\n\nWhat is your recommendation for the English part?\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"06e0bfc5-e12f-4c82-8516-5a4e847b66f6","timestamp":"2026-02-11T00:53:23.634Z"}
