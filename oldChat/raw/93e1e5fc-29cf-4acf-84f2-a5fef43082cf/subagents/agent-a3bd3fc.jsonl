I agree with all four points:\n\n1. **\"Experience\" prime:** Good to know R2 already resolved this. I support adding the retrospective version to the full-collection report.\n\n2. **Essay-specific questions:** Your critique of my weaker proposals is correct. The Essay 1 question does presuppose change (a reader who felt nothing should not be made to feel they failed). The Essay 5 \"could you explain it?\" activates performance mode rather than experiential reporting. The Essay 7 italicized \"truly understood\" carries normative charge. I concede all three.\n\nHowever, I do NOT recommend reopening the unanimous decision. On reflection, the architecture we arrived at (generic during, targeted after) is the right one. The three strongest questions from my set (Essays 3, 4, Appendix) would provide useful data, but the marginal gain does not justify overturning a unanimous consensus. The expanded Critical Experiential Checks already cover these essays' payloads at the end of the protocol.\n\n**My recommendation:** Add only the retrospective \"experience\" question to the full-collection report. Do not reopen the essay-specific questions decision.\n\n3. **Preface baseline:** Confirmed, already covered. No action needed.\n\n4. **Critical Checks placement:** Confirmed. No action needed.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"943bbe0e-9d9c-42c0-89e8-806e0f7f5e2e","timestamp":"2026-02-11T09:23:01.496Z"}
