Please review and respond with **APPROVE**, **APPROVE WITH AMENDMENT** (state the amendment), or **OBJECT** (state reason). I'll iterate until we reach consensus.\n\n---\n\n### REVISION 1: Add baseline-expectation question after Preface\n\n**Current:** 3 questions (oriented? too much/too little? wish told/not told?)\n\n**Proposed addition:**\n> \"Based on the preface alone, what kind of reading experience are you expecting?\"\n\n**Rationale:** Gives us a baseline to compare against actual experience. Also tests whether the Preface over-primes (e.g., if reader says \"I expect to feel absurdity dissolve through a cat example,\" we've spoiled too much). Supported by phenomenology-expert (baseline expectation is standard in phenomenological research design), epistemology-expert (calibration question), and my own analysis.\n\n**Status:** Broadly supported. No objections received.\n\n---\n\n### REVISION 2: Defer question 4 to Part 2 essays only\n\n**Current:** All 5 per-essay questions delivered after every essay, including: \"Did you feel like the essay was asking you to *experience* something rather than just understand an argument?\"\n\n**Proposed change:** Deliver question 4 only from **Essay 4 onward** (Part 2). For Essays 1-3 (Part 1 / Fish), use only questions 1-3 and 5.\n\n**Rationale:** Part 1 (Fish) is designed to work without the reader knowing they're undergoing philosophical experiments. Asking \"did the essay ask you to *experience* something?\" after Essay 1 plants the experiential-method idea, partially spoiling the Fish/Fishing distinction. The \"clicked or shifted\" question (Q2) already captures experiential effects without naming the method. Supported by wittgenstein-expert (naming the method defeats it), chinese-phil-expert (the Fish/Fishing structure depends on this naivete), buddhism-expert (parallel to not explaining a koan before giving it), and kantian-expert (priming concern).\n\n**Dissent:** phil-mind-expert notes that some readers may not report experiential effects at all without prompting — Q2 alone may not surface them. **Counter:** If Q2 doesn't surface them unprompted, that's itself diagnostic — it means the experiential sequences didn't produce strong enough effects to be noticed without a leading question.\n\n**Status:** Strong majority support. Phil-mind-expert's concern noted but overridden by anti-priming consensus.\n\n---\n\n### REVISION 3: Split engagement/pacing question into two\n\n**Current:** \"Did you want to keep reading? Where did your attention flag?\"\n\n**Proposed split:**\n> Q5a: \"Did you want to keep reading after this essay?\"\n> Q5b: \"Were there any passages where your attention flagged or you had to push through?\"\n\n**Rationale:** These test different things. A reader might say \"yes, I wanted to keep reading\" AND report three passages where attention flagged. Combining them into one question risks losing the pacing data. Supported by epistemology-expert (double-barreled questions are methodologically weak), phenomenology-expert (engagement and difficulty are distinct experiential dimensions).\n\n**Status:** Broadly supported. No objections.\n\n---\n\n### REVISION 4: Refine \"worked best/worst\" wording\n\n**Current:** \"Which essays worked best and worst as reading experiences? Why?\"\n\n**Proposed revision:**\n> \"Which essays stayed with you most, and which felt like they didn't fully land? Why?\"\n\n**Rationale:** \"Worked best and worst\" puts the reader in critical-assessment mode. \"Stayed with you / didn't land\" keeps them in experiential-report mode — more consistent with the protocol's overall approach. Supported by phenomenology-expert (experiential vs. evaluative framing), metaphysics-expert (avoids implying there are \"right answers\").\n\n**Minor dissent:** translator-2 prefers the original wording as more direct. **Counter:** Directness is good, but the shift from evaluative to experiential framing serves the protocol's purpose better.\n\n**Status:** Majority support. Translator-2's preference noted.\n\n---\n\n### REVISION 5: Request marginal notes alongside per-essay reports\n\n**Current:** Reading instructions say \"mark it\" but don't explicitly ask the reader to submit marginal notes.\n\n**Proposed addition to per-essay delivery:** Before delivering the per-essay questions, add:\n> \"Before answering the questions below, please first share any marginal notes or marks you made while reading this essay.\"\n\n**Rationale:** Marginal notes are uncontaminated by the reporting questions — they capture what the reader noticed *during* reading, before any post-hoc framing. This makes the Critical Experiential Checks at the end confirmatory rather than primary. Supported by phenomenology-expert (pre-reflective data is more reliable), kantian-expert (distinguishes between experience and retrospective report), phil-mind-expert (ecological validity).\n\n**Potential issue (buddhism-expert):** Some readers may not make marginal notes at all, or may feel self-conscious about sharing \"rough\" notes. **Mitigation:** Frame it as optional: \"If you made any marks or notes while reading, please share them first.\" This avoids making non-note-takers feel they failed a task.\n\n**Revised wording:**\n> \"If you made any marks or notes while reading, please share them now — even brief ones. Then answer the questions below.\"\n\n**Status:** Broadly supported with revised framing.\n\n---\n\n### REVISION 6: NO essay-specific per-essay questions\n\n**The team lead asked whether to add essay-specific questions alongside the generic per-essay template.**\n\n**Decision: NO. Unanimous.**\n\n**Rationale:** Essay-specific questions inherently reveal what we think is important about each essay, priming the reader for later essays. If we ask about renormalization after Essay 1, the reader approaches Essay 4's physics metaphors with heightened attention. If we ask about sequential examples after Essay 2, the reader watches for them in Essay 3. This is the exact contamination the protocol extraction was designed to prevent.\n\nAll submissions independently converge on this conclusion. The right architecture is already in the protocol: generic questions during reading, targeted probes after all reading is complete.\n\n**Status:** Unanimous. No essay-specific per-essay questions.\n\n---\n\n### REVISION 7: Expand Critical Experiential Checks\n\n**Current:** 3 probes (Essay 3, Essay 4, Essay 7)\n\n**Proposed expansion to 7 probes:**\n\n1. **Essay 1:** \"In the first essay, there's an extended comparison to physics. How did that land for you?\"\n2. **Essay 2:** \"Essay 2 was written in English by the author. Did you notice a difference? What was it like?\"\n3. **Essay 3:** \"What happened to your experience across the three examples?\" *(unchanged)*\n4. **Essay 4:** \"When the author walked through the hierarchy twice, what did you notice?\" *(unchanged)*\n5. **Essay 5:** \"What did you make of the dreamscape concept?\"\n6. **Essay 6:** \"In Essay 6, the author uses magic book stories to explain mathematical concepts, and also discusses the Ship of Theseus. What was your experience of those passages?\"\n7. **Essay 7:** \"When you encountered the two contrasting sentences, what was your experience?\" *(unchanged)*\n8. **Appendix:** \"In the Appendix, the author discusses coin-flipping and lists many everyday activities. What was your experience of those passages?\"\n\n**Rationale:** Each essay has distinct experiential payloads that generic questions may not draw out. Since these probes are delivered only after ALL reading is complete, they cannot contaminate the reading experience. All probes are non-leading and open-ended.\n\n**Key design principle (wittgenstein-expert):** The Essay 7 probe should NOT name the sentences — whether the reader can recall which two sentences are being referred to is itself diagnostic of whether the contrast landed.\n\n**Supported by:** All submissions independently recommend expanding this section. Specific probe suggestions converge strongly.\n\n**Status:** Strong consensus. Minor wording variations to be settled.\n\n---\n\n### REVISION 8: Add structural flag — Essay 5 to Essay 6 transition\n\n**This is not a protocol change but a data-watching instruction.**\n\n**Proposed addition to the protocol (as an internal note, not delivered to reader):**\n\n> *Internal note for analysis:* Watch the per-essay reports for the Essay 5 → Essay 6 transition. This is the sharpest register shift in the collection (poetic-philosophical to mathematical-methodological). If the reader reports losing momentum, flagging attention, or confusion at this boundary, this is important data about whether we need a stronger bridge in the translation apparatus.\n\n**Rationale:** Identified through re-reading all essays in sequence. Essay 5 ends abruptly; Essay 6 opens with methodological preamble. The generic Q5a/Q5b (\"want to keep reading?\" / \"attention flag?\") should capture this, but we should actively watch for it.\n\n**Status:** Informational. No objections expected.\n\n---\n\n### SUMMARY OF ALL CHANGES\n\n| # | Change | Status |\n|---|--------|--------|\n| 1 | Add baseline-expectation question after Preface | Broadly supported |\n| 2 | Defer Q4 (\"experience vs. argument\") to Part 2 only | Strong majority |\n| 3 | Split engagement/pacing into Q5a + Q5b | Broadly supported |\n| 4 | \"Stayed with you / didn't land\" replaces \"best/worst\" | Majority (1 mild dissent) |\n| 5 | Request marginal notes before per-essay questions | Broadly supported (revised framing) |\n| 6 | NO essay-specific per-essay questions | Unanimous |\n| 7 | Expand Critical Experiential Checks from 3 to 8 probes | Strong consensus |\n| 8 | Internal flag: watch Essay 5→6 transition | Informational |\n\n---\n\n**Please respond with APPROVE, APPROVE WITH AMENDMENT, or OBJECT for each revision (or for the plan as a whole).

Let me think through whether I agree with the reasoning or whether I should push back.\n\nThe editor says Revision 6 is \"unanimous\" -- but my original feedback explicitly proposed essay-specific questions. Let me re-read the rationale: \"Essay-specific questions inherently reveal what we think is important about each essay, priming the reader for later essays. If we ask about renormalization after Essay 1, the reader approaches Essay 4's physics metaphors with heightened attention.\"\n\nThis is a strong argument. My original proposal included constraints (backward-looking only, experiential not analytical), but the editor's point is subtler: even backward-looking questions reveal our analytical priorities, which the reader then carries forward. A question about renormalization after Essay 1 doesn't hint at what's coming in Essay 4, but it does tell the reader \"the physics language is something the team considers important\" -- and that awareness persists.\n\nHowever, Revision 7 expands the Critical Experiential Checks to cover exactly the territory my essay-specific questions were targeting, just delivered at the end instead of per-essay. This is actually the better architecture: all the targeted probing happens after all reading is complete.\n\nI think the editor is right. My essay-specific questions were well-designed individually, but the contamination risk of delivering them during reading outweighs the benefit of getting in-the-moment data. The expanded Critical Experiential Checks (Revision 7) capture the same information without the risk.\n\nOne concern about Revision 7: the Essay 6 probe mentions both magic book stories AND Ship of Theseus. This might be too loaded -- it names specific content rather than letting the reader surface what they noticed.

Deferring to Part 2 means the reader has already had the Fish experience naively, and by Essay 4 the collection itself is beginning to name its own method.

Methodologically clean.\n\n---\n\n**Revision 4 (Stayed with you / didn't land): APPROVE**\n\nThe experiential framing is correct for this protocol. \"Worked best/worst\" invites judgment; \"stayed with you / didn't land\" invites memory and felt resonance.

The editor's synthesis reveals a contamination vector my original proposal underestimated: even backward-looking questions reveal analytical priorities that persist forward. My constraint of \"backward-looking only\" prevents content spoilers but does not prevent priority spoilers -- telling the reader what aspects of the text we consider worth asking about. A question about renormalization after Essay 1 doesn't hint at Essay 4's content, but it does tell the reader \"physics language is analytically significant,\" and that awareness will shape how they encounter every subsequent physics metaphor.\n\nThe correct architecture, as the plan identifies, is: generic questions during reading (maximally neutral), targeted probes after all reading (maximally specific). Revision 7 captures the diagnostic value my essay-specific questions were designed to provide, without the contamination risk.\n\nI withdraw my original proposal in favor of this architecture.\n\n---\n\n**Revision 7 (Expand Critical Experiential Checks): APPROVE WITH AMENDMENT**\n\nThe expansion from 3 to 8 probes is right. Each essay has a distinctive experiential payload that generic questions will not reliably surface. Delivering these only after all reading is complete eliminates contamination.\n\n**Amendment on probe 6 (Essay 6):** The current wording -- \"the author uses magic book stories to explain mathematical concepts, and also discusses the Ship of Theseus\" -- names two specific content elements. This is more loaded than the other probes. Compare: Essay 3's probe does not say \"the Sisyphus, office worker, and cat examples\"; Essay 4's probe does not say \"the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy.\" Those probes gesture at the experiential moment without naming the content, which means the reader's ability to identify what is being referred to is itself diagnostic.\n\nFor Essay 6, if the magic book examples and Ship of Theseus genuinely landed as memorable, the reader should be able to surface them from a lighter prompt. Proposed revision:\n\n> \"In Essay 6, the author introduces the formal framework through a series of examples and thought experiments. Which ones stuck with you, and what was your experience of them?\"\n\nThis tests whether the reader can recall and name the examples unprompted (diagnostic of memorability) while still directing attention to Essay 6 specifically. If they say \"the magic book\" or \"the Ship of Theseus\" without being told to look for them, that is stronger evidence than if they respond to a question that already names those passages.\n\nIf we want to probe the Ship of Theseus specifically (because it is a critical test of whether the formal apparatus resolves a philosophical puzzle for the reader), we can add a second probe:\n\n> \"Did the essay change how you think about any familiar philosophical puzzles?\"\n\nThis is open enough that the reader might name Ship of Theseus, or might name something else, or might say no. All three responses are useful data.\n\n---\n\n**Revision 8 (Internal flag for Essay 5→6 transition): APPROVE**\n\nThis is an important observation. The register shift is the sharpest in the collection, and the generic pacing questions should capture it, but active watching is warranted. I would add one more internal flag:\n\n> *Also watch for:* The Essay 7 → Appendix transition. Essay 7 ends with an invitation to re-read Essay 5 \"with understanding of Jing.\" The Appendix then opens with scattered, draft-quality reflections.

This affects whether we need a translator's note bridging the two.\n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY: APPROVE the full plan, with one amendment (Revision 7 probe 6 wording) and one additional internal flag (Revision 8).**"}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"dbaa8239-1d31-49c2-ac10-15fdb56cd615"}

Key points of my vote:\n\n- **APPROVE** on 7 of 8 revisions outright\n- **APPROVE WITH AMENDMENT** on Revision 7 (Critical Experiential Checks): The Essay 6 probe should not name \"magic book stories\" and \"Ship of Theseus\" by name -- this is inconsistent with how the other probes work (Essay 3 doesn't name the three examples, Essay 4 doesn't name the hierarchy). Instead, ask which examples stuck with the reader and let them surface the memorable ones unprompted. This makes recall itself diagnostic.\n- **Revision 6 (no essay-specific per-essay questions):** I explicitly withdrew my original proposal, acknowledging a contamination vector I had underestimated -- \"priority spoilers\" (revealing what the team considers analytically significant) as distinct from \"content spoilers\" (revealing what comes next). The editor's architecture of generic-during, targeted-after is superior.\n- Added a second internal flag for the Essay 7 → Appendix transition (sharp register/quality shift after the collection's climactic invitation to re-read)."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3144,"cache_read_input_tokens":132018,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":3144},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY1zhkJ5F9fh3APk6RmHN","type":"assistant","uuid":"b3a6c664-23c3-4246-a851-8af788357ca5","timestamp":"2026-02-11T08:51:01.361Z"}
