To confirm you have it — my submission covered:\n\n1. General assessment (protocol is well-designed, staged delivery is correct)\n2. Essay-specific questions: Yes, but only as Critical Experiential Checks at the very end. Proposed checks for Essays 1, 2, 5, and 6 (we already have 3, 4, 7).\n3. Soften per-essay question line 31 (\"Did you feel like the essay was asking you to *experience* something...\") — slightly leading; proposed alternative: \"How would you describe what this essay was asking you to do — follow an argument? Notice something? Something else?\"\n4. Add Preface anticipation-detection question: \"Is there anything from the Preface that you're now anticipating or looking for in the essays?\"\n5. Slightly sharpen Essay 7 check to ask about \"the difference in your experience of reading them\"\n6. Consider a re-read prompt for Essay 3 to test order-dependence\n\nIf you need me to resend the full text, let me know.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"47945f8e-c652-42d4-b400-07ad7c302267","timestamp":"2026-02-11T09:20:22.369Z"}
