The Author's Analysis of Justified True Belief in \"A Thought on Knowledge\"\n     4→\n     5→\"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay #2) is the most directly epistemological text in the collection. The author, Xueqi Li, undertakes a systematic deconstruction of the classical tripartite definition of knowledge as Justified True Belief (JTB). The analysis is notable for its methodological orientation: rather than engaging with the standard post-Gettier literature directly, the author asks a prior question -- *why do we discuss knowledge this way at all?*\n     6→\n     7→### Relation to Gettier Problems\n     8→\n     9→The author does not explicitly name Gettier, but the essay implicitly renders Gettier problems moot. Gettier cases show that JTB is insufficient for knowledge by constructing scenarios where one has justified true belief but not knowledge. The author's argument goes further: the truth condition is not merely insufficient but *methodologically inaccessible*. If we can never verify our beliefs against objective truth (we can only check against phenomena or other beliefs), then the entire apparatus that generates Gettier problems -- the gap between justification-plus-truth and genuine knowledge -- dissolves. Gettier problems presuppose that truth is a meaningful independent condition that can accidentally coincide with justification; the author argues that from the epistemic agent's standpoint, truth never enters the picture at all. This is a more radical move than most post-Gettier responses.\n    10→\n    11→### Relation to Foundationalism\n    12→\n    13→The author engages foundationalism directly, though not by name. The analysis of justification starting points identifies three possible bases: phenomena, justified beliefs, or truth. The author then argues:\n    14→- Truth-based starting points collapse into phenomena or belief in practice (we never access truth directly).\n    15→- Phenomena-based starting points require \"digestion\" (conversion into thought), which makes them functionally belief-based.\n    16→- Therefore all justification reduces to justified belief.\n    17→\n    18→This creates a devastating dilemma for foundationalism: if all justification is belief-based, then either (a) there are unjustified foundational beliefs (undermining foundationalism's claim that basic beliefs are justified), or (b) justification is circular. The author's treatment of circular justification in the sidenote (\"The other option: circular justified beliefs\") is particularly inventive -- arguing that accepting circularity leads to the absurd conclusion that babies must possess knowledge, requiring either instantaneous simultaneous justification, infinite chains of before-lives, or circular lives. This reductio is original and effective.\n    19→\n    20→### Relation to Coherentism\n    21→\n    22→The author's argument that justification reduces to belief-about-belief structurally resembles coherentism (knowledge is justified by coherence with a system of beliefs). However, the author does not embrace coherentism as a solution. Instead, the reduction to belief is presented as revealing that knowledge *just is* belief -- \"what each individual believes to be correct.\" The coherentist's web of beliefs is acknowledged but treated as the only thing that exists, rather than as a theory of justification that preserves a meaningful distinction between knowledge and mere belief.\n    23→\n    24→### Relation to Reliabilism\n    25→\n    26→The sidenote on \"Examples of justification bases\" explicitly lists \"Reliable processes\" as one category of justification base, classifying it as \"phenomena or truth.\" The author's key argument applies: whatever reliable processes are in themselves, what matters is *how we access them*. A reliable process must manifest as a phenomenon or be converted into belief to serve as a starting point for justification. This effectively neutralizes reliabilism's externalist move: even if a belief is produced by a reliable process, the epistemic agent can only use this fact insofar as it enters their phenomenal experience or belief system.\n    27→\n    28→---\n    29→\n    30→## 2. The Argument that Justification Reduces to Belief\n    31→\n    32→This is the central epistemological thesis of \"A Thought on Knowledge\" and arguably the most significant philosophical claim in the collection from an epistemological standpoint.\n    33→\n    34→The argument proceeds in three steps:\n    35→\n    36→1. **Truth-based justification collapses**: We have no direct access to truth; we access only phenomena. The rain example is instructive -- to verify \"it is raining outside,\" we look outside, but we only obtain the phenomenon of potential rain (we might be deceived by a sprinkler). Therefore, truth-based starting points are, in practice, phenomena-based or belief-based.\n    37→\n    38→2. **Phenomena-based justification collapses**: Phenomena require \"digestion\" -- conversion into thought -- before they can serve as justification bases. The three Bob examples brilliantly illustrate this: (a) Bob uses a memory-based belief to reject a claim; (b) Bob looks outside but, deceived by a sprinkler, still relies on interpretation; (c) Bob sees rain but, absorbed in emotional reverie, does not form the belief \"it is raining\" at all. The third case is especially powerful: it shows that phenomena do not automatically become justification bases; they require active cognitive processing.\n    39→\n    40→3. **Therefore, all justification is belief-based**: Justification based on justified belief is \"a second order of belief (belief about belief).\"\n    41→\n    42→The implications are radical:\n    43→- **The truth condition is vacuous**: \"In practice, the only thing that exists is 'what each individual believes to be correct.'\"\n    44→- **Knowledge is belief**: The distinction between knowledge and belief collapses in practice.\n    45→- **Agrippa's Trilemma is resolved by accepting the first horn**: Knowledge bottoms out in unjustified belief, but this is not a deficiency -- it is simply how cognition works.\n    46→\n    47→This has significant implications for epistemology as a discipline. If knowledge is just belief, then epistemology's traditional project of distinguishing knowledge from mere belief is misconceived. The productive questions become: What standards do communities use to evaluate beliefs? How do those standards change? What is their utility? The author gestures toward this in the \"Knowledge in motion\" sidenote, where the Standard Model in physics is presented as the winning belief-system according to the standard of predictive success.\n    48→\n    49→---\n    50→\n    51→## 3. The \"Access\" Argument\n    52→\n    53→The sidenote titled \"Access\" and the discussion of justification bases contain what I consider one of the essay's most philosophically important moves: the shift from asking *what justification bases are* to asking *how we access them*.\n    54→\n    55→> \"The key point is that for each justification basis, we must think about how we access it, instead of what is it. Things that are not accessible cannot be used as a starting point in practical justification.\"\n    56→\n    57→This is a methodological principle with far-reaching consequences. It applies uniformly across all proposed justification bases:\n    58→\n    59→- **Evidence**: If evidence is \"truth,\" it must be accessed through phenomena; if phenomena, it must be digested into belief.\n    60→- **A priori justification**: Must manifest through shaping phenomena we experience.\n    61→- **Innate cognitive structures**: \"manifest only through shaping phenomena we experience, thus phenomenon-based in practice.\"\n    62→- **Reliable processes**: Must be accessible as phenomena or truth, which in turn collapse into belief.\n    63→- **Testimony**: Known through phenomena (hearing someone speak, reading a text).\n    64→- **Mathematical/logical principles**: In practice, accessed as justified beliefs (the sidenote \"Access to truth\" in mathematics is devastating: mathematicians prove things from starting points \"taken to be true\" using methods \"taken to be true\").\n    65→\n    66→The access argument is essentially a *methodological phenomenalism* applied to epistemology. It does not claim that nothing exists beyond phenomena (that would be ontological phenomenalism); it claims that nothing beyond phenomena can function as a starting point for justification *in practice*. This is why the author repeatedly emphasizes \"in practice\" and \"in real life.\"\n    67→\n    68→The philosophical significance is that this argument is largely framework-independent. It does not depend on any particular metaphysical commitments. Whether you are a realist, idealist, or pragmatist, you must still answer the question: how does your preferred justification base enter the justification process? And the author argues that the answer is always: through phenomena, which are then digested into belief.\n    69→\n    70→This connects directly to the later essays' use of P (phenomenon/现象) as the \"first reality\" (第一实在). The epistemological access argument provides the groundwork for the metaphysical framework developed in \"后形而上学 整理\" (Essay #4).\n    71→\n    72→---\n    73→\n    74→## 4. The K1 Strategy's Model of Knowledge Formation (知识的发生)\n    75→\n    76→The K1 strategy essay (Essay #7) develops a formal categorical model of how knowledge arises. The section \"知识的发生\" (the genesis/occurrence of knowledge) is a remarkable attempt to formalize epistemological processes using category theory.\n    77→\n    78→### The Knowledge Category\n    79→\n    80→The author defines $(\\mathcal{E}_K)_t$ as the knowledge structure at time $t$. Objects are beliefs; morphisms are justification relations (证实关系). Crucially, the author notes that justification relations are themselves beliefs -- \"what we accept as valid argumentation\" -- maintaining consistency with the reduction of justification to belief from \"A Thought on Knowledge.\"\n    81→\n    82→### The Formation Process\n    83→\n    84→Knowledge formation proceeds through a functor:\n    85→$$\n    86→(F_{L \\to K})_t: (\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\to (\\mathcal{E}_K)_t\n    87→$$\n    88→\n    89→This maps linguistic structures to knowledge structures. The process:\n    90→\n    91→1. Through language games, a new sentence $a$ is constructed in the language category $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$.\n    92→2. Introspection (via the functor $(F_{L \\to K})_t$) maps this sentence to a belief in the knowledge network.\n    93→3. The knowledge category evolves: the new belief is either accepted or rejected based on whether it preserves the stable structure $S_K$.\n    94→4. When $a$'s corresponding belief becomes an object in the evolved $(\\mathcal{E}_K)_{t'}$, \"knowledge has occurred\" (知识就发生了).\n    95→\n    96→This is epistemologically significant for several reasons:\n    97→\n    98→- **Knowledge is processual**: Knowledge is not a static state but an event -- it \"occurs\" (发生) through the evolution of categorical structures.\n    99→- **Language precedes knowledge**: Language games generate candidate beliefs that are then filtered through the knowledge structure. This aligns with later Wittgenstein but gives it formal structure.\n   100→- **The knowledge structure is self-regulating**: Acceptance/rejection is determined by compatibility with the existing stable structure $S_K$, which is a form of coherentism but formalized categorically.\n   101→- **Even rejection causes perturbation**: \"Even rejection may cause perturbation to the knowledge network\" -- this is a subtle and important point. Failed knowledge claims still affect the epistemic structure.\n   102→\n   103→### The Role of E_t\n   104→\n   105→The functor $(F_{L \\to K})_t$ may factor through the total experiential category $\\mathbb{E}_t$:\n   106→$$\n   107→(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,L})_t} \\mathbb{E}_t \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,K})_{t+1}^{-1}} (\\mathcal{E}_K)_{t+2}\n   108→$$\n   109→\n   110→This means knowledge formation passes through the full experiential field. The stable structure $S_E$ of experience constrains what can become knowledge. This is a formal expression of the idea that knowledge is shaped by (and shapes) our broader experiential life.\n   111→\n   112→---\n   113→\n   114→## 5. The Stable Structure S_K and Its Epistemological Significance\n   115→\n   116→The concept of stable structures preserved under evolution is perhaps the most original contribution of the K1 strategy to epistemology.\n   117→\n   118→### Definition and Nature\n   119→\n   120→$S_K$ is defined as a structure within $(\\mathcal{E}_K)_t$ that is preserved across the evolution $T$. It is what remains invariant as the knowledge category evolves through the addition and rejection of beliefs.\n   121→\n   122→### Epistemological Significance\n   123→\n   124→1. **A priori structures**: The author explicitly connects $S_E$ (the stable structure of the total experiential category) to the possibility of \"a priori cognitive structures.\" If one takes $\\mathbb{E}_{t_c}$ at the earliest moment of cognitive life, then $S_{E_c}$ (the stable structure at that point) could be identified with innate cognitive structures. If some part of $S_E$ is necessary for constructing any $\\mathbb{E}_t$ from phenomena $\\mathfrak{P}_t$, that part can be called a \"cognitive structure\" (认知结构). This is a formalization of something close to Kant's categories, but arrived at through categorical evolution rather than transcendental deduction.\n   125→\n   126→2. **Grammar and logic as stable structures**: The author notes that in the language category $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$, the stable structure corresponds to \"things like grammatical rules.\" This suggests that grammar, logic, and similar formal structures are epistemologically fundamental not because they are a priori truths, but because they are *evolutionarily stable* in the categorical sense.\n   127→\n   128→3. **Indirect access through language games**: Since $S_E$ is difficult to study directly, the K1 strategy proposes studying $S_L$ (the stable structure of language) and using the functor $(F_{E,L})_t$ to approximate $S_E$:\n   129→$$\n   130→(F_{E,L})_t(S_L) \\approx S_E\n   131→$$\n   132→This provides a methodological justification for linguistic analysis in epistemology -- a formal grounding for the \"linguistic turn.\"\n   133→\n   134→4. **Cross-domain convergence**: By studying multiple sub-categories (language, mathematics, etc.) and their respective stable structures, we can triangulate toward $S_E$. This is methodologically powerful: it suggests that philosophical progress comes from examining the same experiential structure through multiple formal lenses.\n   135→\n   136→5. **Descriptive, not normative**: The author carefully notes that these stable structures are descriptive. Whether they carry metaphysical or normative weight is left open. This is epistemological modesty of the right kind.\n   137→\n   138→---\n   139→\n   140→## 6. The Meno Paradox Resolution\n   141→\n   142→The Meno paradox -- if you don't know what you're looking for, how will you recognize it when you find it? If you already know, why search? -- receives a structural resolution in the K1 strategy's framework (in the KA猜想 section).\n   143→\n   144→The resolution proceeds:\n   145→1. When we cannot obtain the $\\eta$ feeling (the experience of alignment between a structure's evolution and our experiential evolution), we sense that we don't fully understand something.\n   146→2. This failure may be due to gaps in the network (missing paths/morphisms) or due to \"tension\" (张力) -- an inability to organize the network to achieve a universal property.\n   147→3. We therefore know \"the thing I need to learn\" exists as a structural gap or unresolved tension -- it is \"not something I have already learned\" but something whose *structural position* is partially determined by the existing network.\n   148→4. When, through reorganizing morphisms or acquiring new concepts, the network forms a universal property and we obtain $\\eta$, \"we feel we have learned the thing we previously wanted to learn.\"\n   149→\n   150→This is elegant because it resolves the paradox without positing any mysterious pre-knowledge. What we \"know\" before learning is not the content of what we will learn, but the *structural signature of its absence* -- the gaps and tensions in our current knowledge network. The object of inquiry is defined negatively, by the shape of what is missing. This is reminiscent of Polanyi's \"tacit knowledge\" but given precise categorical form.\n   151→\n   152→From a translation perspective, the phrase \"知识的发生\" is epistemologically loaded. \"发生\" means \"to happen/occur/arise\" and carries connotations of emergence and genesis. \"The occurrence of knowledge\" or \"the genesis of knowledge\" are both possibilities, but neither fully captures the dynamic, event-like quality the author intends.\n   153→\n   154→---\n   155→\n   156→## 7. Translation Challenges for Epistemological Terms\n   157→\n   158→### Core Terms\n   159→\n   160→1. **知识 (zhishi)**: Straightforwardly \"knowledge,\" but the author's analysis shows that what is usually called 知识 in Chinese is closer to \"what is believed to be correct\" than to the philosophical technical term \"knowledge\" (JTB). A translator should note this tension.\n   161→\n   162→2. **信念 (xinnian)**: \"Belief\" -- but in Chinese philosophical usage, 信念 carries stronger connotations of conviction or commitment than the English epistemological use of \"belief\" (which can be very weak, as in \"I believe it might rain\"). The author's use in the formal framework is closer to the English technical sense.\n   163→\n   164→3. **证实关系 (zhengshi guanxi)**: \"Justification relation\" or \"verification relation.\" The Chinese 证实 can mean both \"justify\" and \"verify/confirm,\" and the author seems to intend both senses simultaneously. In the K1 framework, these are morphisms in the knowledge category -- they are the *connections* between beliefs that constitute epistemic structure. \"Epistemic linkage\" might capture the structural sense better, but loses the justificatory connotation.\n   165→\n   166→4. **现象 (xianxiang)**: \"Phenomena\" -- but the author's usage is closer to the phenomenological sense (what is given in experience) than the scientific sense (observable events). The sidenote explicitly clarifies: \"it refers to what we experience or observe.\" The translation should preserve this experiential emphasis.\n   167→\n   168→5. **第一实在 (di-yi shizai)**: \"First reality\" -- a term coined by the author to denote phenomena as the epistemological starting point. The footnote clarifies this is not an ontological claim about what is \"really real\" but a methodological claim about what is epistemically primary. \"Primary actuality\" or \"first actuality\" might work, though \"first reality\" is more natural.\n   169→\n   170→6. **知识的发生 (zhishi de fasheng)**: \"The occurrence/genesis of knowledge\" -- as noted above, this is a key phrase. \"Knowledge formation\" loses the event-character; \"the happening of knowledge\" is awkward but more faithful; \"knowledge emergence\" adds connotations of emergence theory that may not be intended.\n   171→\n   172→7. **稳定结构 (wending jiegou)**: \"Stable structure\" -- straightforward, but in the epistemological context, it functions as the author's replacement for concepts like \"a priori categories,\" \"cognitive frameworks,\" or \"epistemic norms.\" The translation should preserve its structural/mathematical character rather than assimilating it to existing philosophical vocabulary.\n   173→\n   174→8. **境 (jing)**: This is the collection's central term and the hardest to translate. In the epistemological context, it functions as \"the categorical structure over phenomena\" -- the organized experiential field within which knowledge operates. \"Sphere\" captures the boundedness; \"realm\" the experiential quality; \"field\" the structural aspect. None is fully adequate. I recommend preserving 境 as a technical term (Jing) with explanation, as its meaning is constituted by the entire theoretical framework.\n   175→\n   176→### Structural Challenges\n   177→\n   178→The author moves fluidly between colloquial Chinese, formal philosophical Chinese, and mathematical notation. The epistemological arguments in \"A Thought on Knowledge\" are written in accessible English, while the K1 strategy's epistemological sections are in Chinese with heavy mathematical formalism. A translator must navigate:\n   179→\n   180→- The shift from everyday examples (rain, Bob) to formal categorical structures\n   181→- The author's deliberate avoidance of standard philosophical terminology (the author often coins terms rather than using established philosophical Chinese, and explicitly warns readers about this in Essay #4)\n   182→- The interplay between Chinese philosophical concepts (道德仁义礼) and Western epistemological frameworks\n   183→- Mathematical notation that carries philosophical meaning (functors as \"introspection,\" morphisms as \"justification relations\")\n   184→\n   185→---\n   186→\n   187→## 8. Overall Significance for Epistemology\n   188→\n   189→### What Is Achieved\n   190→\n   191→1. **A practice-first epistemology**: The author consistently asks \"what happens in practice?\" rather than \"what is conceptually possible?\" This is not mere pragmatism -- it is a principled methodological stance grounded in the access argument. Knowledge is analyzed as it actually functions in human cognitive life, not as an idealized abstract relation.\n   192→\n   193→2. **The dissolution of the JTB framework**: The author does not add a fourth condition to JTB (as in most post-Gettier epistemology) or reject one condition. Instead, the author shows that truth and justification both reduce to belief in practice, making the tripartite analysis a distinction without a difference. This is more radical than most contemporary epistemological positions.\n   194→\n   195→3. **A formal framework for epistemic dynamics**: The K1 strategy provides what analytic epistemology has largely lacked: a formal model of how knowledge *changes over time*. The evolution functor $T$, the stable structures $S_K$, and the natural transformation $\\eta$ provide precise tools for analyzing epistemic processes. This is epistemology as a theory of epistemic *processes* rather than epistemic *states*.\n   196→\n   197→4. **The naturalization of a priori structures**: By identifying potential \"a priori cognitive structures\" as stable structures under categorical evolution, the author provides a framework that is compatible with both Kantian and naturalistic epistemology. The a priori is not transcendentally deduced but empirically identified (through its invariance under evolution).\n   198→\n   199→5. **A resolution of the Meno paradox**: The structural-gap account of inquiry is original, precise, and satisfying. It shows how one can seek what one does not yet know by being sensitive to the structural features of one's own ignorance.\n   200→\n   201→6. **Bridging analytic and continental epistemology**: The collection moves between phenomenological analysis (phenomena as first reality, the role of lived experience) and formal/analytic methods (category theory, logical analysis of JTB). This is rare and valuable.\n   202→\n   203→### Limitations and Open Questions\n   204→\n   205→1. **The reduction of justification to belief** is powerful but may be too quick. One might argue that the \"digestion\" of phenomena into belief is itself a justificatory process -- that perception justifies belief precisely through the process of digestion, even if the result is a belief. The author's argument may conflate the *vehicle* of justification (always a mental state, hence belief-like) with the *source* of justification (which may be external).\n   206→\n   207→2. **The stable structure $S_K$** is postulated but not identified. The author acknowledges this: \"we might have difficulty finding it.\" The framework is promissory -- its value will depend on whether $S_K$ can be characterized concretely.\n   208→\n   209→3. **The relationship between the access argument and externalism** deserves further development. The access argument seems to rule out externalist epistemologies (reliabilism, proper functionalism), but the K1 framework's use of stable structures that agents may not be aware of reintroduces something like externalist elements.\n   210→\n   211→4. **The KA conjecture** remains a \"Todo\" -- the author explicitly marks this as unfinished. The conjecture aims to derive the A1 strategy's definition of metaphysical concepts as universal properties from the K1 framework, which would unify the epistemological and metaphysical parts of the project.\n   212→\n   213→### Historical Positioning\n   214→\n   215→The author's epistemological position is closest to:\n   216→- **Quine's naturalized epistemology** in its rejection of a priori justification and its focus on how knowledge actually works\n   217→- **Wittgenstein's later philosophy** in the role of language games and the dissolution of traditional philosophical problems\n   218→- **Kant's transcendental philosophy** in the search for conditions of possibility of knowledge (stable structures)\n   219→- **Pragmatism (James, Dewey)** in the emphasis on practice and the redefinition of knowledge in terms of utility and communal standards\n   220→\n   221→But the author's use of category theory to formalize these insights is genuinely novel. The combination of phenomenological starting points, deflationary analysis of JTB, and categorical formalization of epistemic dynamics represents an original contribution to epistemology that does not fit neatly into any existing school.\n   222→\n   223→The collection as a whole traces a philosophical journey from high school metaphysical reflections (Essay #4, dated framework) through the resolution of nihilism via \"poetic\" engagement (Essay #5), to a mature formal framework (Essays #6-7) that provides tools for analyzing knowledge, understanding, meaning, and experience. The epistemological thread -- from the access argument through the reduction of knowledge to belief through the categorical formalization of knowledge formation -- is the collection's most technically developed philosophical contribution.\n   224→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

The text represents a systematic attempt to resolve this confusion by examining how the traditional definition of knowledge as justified true belief relates to actual epistemic practices. Beginning with everyday examples, like verifying whether it's raining, the author traces what actually occurs when humans form, check, and justify knowledge. The analysis proceeds through each component of the classical definition, revealing the source of the author's confusion. In the sidenotes, the author includes observations from physics and mathematics to illustrate how knowledge functions in practice.\n     6→geometry: margin=30mm\n     7→---\n     8→# A Thought on Knowledge\n     9→\n    10→\n    11→Recently, I have talked with a friend and we talked about the idea of knowledge as I have always been confused about the purpose of discussing it. This is a short note of my current thought about it.[^1]\n    12→\n    13→Let us first start with the classical definition of knowledge: knowledge is justified true belief. Though the immediate alarm would be the word \"true\", let us first talk about belief.\n    14→\n    15→Knowledge, from this definition, is some kind of belief. There are many different kinds of belief, some are stronger and some are weaker. Here I want to give a more general approach to belief: belief is a thought of taking something as true. It is subjective, as thoughts are subjective, and therefore it is intrinsically irrelevant to \"objective truth\" (if any) as \"objective truth\" is objective. Notice that the evaluation of a belief and whether a belief represents reality needs to involve something beyond belief itself, which means this process is extrinsic, i.e., the connection to \"objective truth\" is extrinsic.\n    16→\n    17→Let us first propose an example belief for our future analysis: \"It is raining outside.\" We will use it throughout the text.\n    18→\n    19→We will postpone the discussion about \"truth\" (the truth condition). However, there are a few points I want to highlight about the truth condition. First, the use of \"truth\" here refers to \"objective truth,\" i.e., it is objective. Second, there is a lot of debate on what can be considered as truth, and there is also much debate on whether there is truth. We will stay away from those discussions about the definition and existence of truth for now, which might raise difficulties, as knowledge is usually considered an access to truth, or at least a relationship with the truth. However, we can sidestep these debates because in practice (in real life), we do not have direct access to truth; we have direct access to phenomena, suggesting that knowledge is actually a relation with phenomena, which might imply something about truth (if any). To illustrate this with an example, to verify the belief that \"it is raining outside,\" we need to (and can only) look outside to see if it is indeed raining. However, the only thing we obtain is the phenomenon of potential rain, as we might be deceived by a fancy sprinkler.\n    20→\n    21→We will now talk about \"justified\" (the justification condition). There could also be debate about the definition of justification, yet we will stay away from those discussions too, but look at how justification works in practice (in a justification that happens in real life). To start a justification, you must have starting points. The starting point must be things we can appeal to without first having to justify our appeal to them during current justification. \n    22→\n    23→One example of a starting point is a phenomenon, as we have it without needing justification, just like in the raining example, we observe that it is raining outside. Besides phenomena, the only possibilities are either justified beliefs, which are already justified from other justifications (i.e., not the current one), or truths, if directly accessible, which need no justification. This covers everything because, besides phenomena, we can either appeal to something inside our mind or something mind-independent. The former are justified beliefs according to its definition in this note, and the latter are truths. This establishes that any starting point of a justification must fall into three categories: justified belief, phenomena, or truth. \n    24→\n    25→We have now illustrated all three components of classical definition of knowledge, and we are ready to explain my take to it. \n    26→\n    27→We will first start from \"true.\" As I have shown, knowledge, as a kind of belief, is intrinsically subjective and irrelevant to truth. Its relation to truth is extrinsic and through phenomena. This therefore implies there is no truth intrinsically in knowledge, nor does knowledge directly connect to truth. In practice, this means we do not and cannot use knowledge against truth directly. In the rain example, to verify \"it is raining outside,\" we can only check our memory of whether it was raining, consult a weather report, or look outside, which are either belief or phenomena, but we can never check it against truth. The truth condition is methodologically impossible. From the perspective of truth, knowledge might happen to agree with it, but as individuals, we cannot access this perspective. The fact that we use the concept of knowledge regardless of these constraints again shows that when we use the word \"knowledge,\" there is nothing about truth in it. \n    28→\n    29→We will now move on to justification. As I have shown, justification must be based on justified belief, phenomena, or truth. For justification based on truth, it is, in practice (in a real justification), just based on phenomena or belief, as I have just shown. If it is based on phenomena, then consider the following example:\n    30→\n    31→1. Alice told Bob, \"It is raining outside.\" Bob recalls that when he came in, it was not raining; therefore, Bob rejected this claim (or Bob justifies the knowledge that \"it is not raining outside\").\n    32→2. Alice told Bob, \"It is raining outside.\" Bob recalled that when he came in, it was not raining, so Bob looked outside. Seeing droplets falling, yet being tricked by the fancy sprinkler, he rejected this claim (or Bob justifies the knowledge that \"it is not raining outside\").\n    33→3. Seeing the droplets falling from outside, Bob did not think of rain at all. His thoughts flowed among the changes of light reflected by the water. He was so sad because his beloved girl, Alice, had just left him. In Bob's mind, he did not realize it was raining at all.\n    34→\n    35→These examples show there is an in-between process that converts phenomena into belief. Indeed, to use a piece of phenomenon, we need not only to access it but also to convert it into thoughts, i.e., digestion. Therefore, in practice, justification based on phenomena is justification based on justified belief. \n    36→\n    37→In the end, if justification is based on justified belief, then it is just a second order of belief (belief about belief). This raises the question, because if all knowledge is at least justified belief, then some of it must have a circular justification, or it must be grounded in a belief that is unjustified, which, in practice, we would not use as a starting point for justification, as an unjustified belief cannot be used as the starting point for the justification of knowledge. If we do not accept circular justification (if you consider that this should not be used as a justification in real life), then this simply suggests that there is knowledge that cannot be justified; knowledge is just... belief?\n    38→\n    39→This illustrates the confusion I have about the purpose of discussing it, because in practice, what we usually consider is \"the teacher told me something...\", i.e., it is a belief of the teacher, or \"I learned that...\", i.e., it is a belief of mine. We also learned that knowledge, as people know it, changes over time (e.g., geocentrism), varies among individuals (e.g., knowledge about the Bible or God), and emerges as humans construct it (e.g., is Los Angeles part of California, what is a violin, and what do we consider as art?). Therefore, it seems to me that, in practice, the only thing that exists is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" (i.e., belief, or you can define it as subjective knowledge if you want). For example, many people hold \"1+1=2\" as a belief because they typically do not know how to prove it mathematically (they can consult mathematicians if they want to justify it). This suggests that, in practice, \"1+1=2\" is purely a belief for them if they do not explicitly justify it, yet they consider it to be knowledge. The idea of \"what each individual believes to be correct\" is useful because it can be extended to \"what most people in a field believe to be correct,\" which can serve as a definition of knowledge and is sufficiently useful for any situation where you need a definition of knowledge.\n    40→\n    41→## Acknowledgement\n    42→I would like to thank Claude for drafting the abstract.\n    43→\n    44→\n    45→\n    46→----\n    47→## Sidenotes\n    48→\n    49→### Examples of  justification bases\n    50→\n    51→This is a short list of a few examples of justification bases. In many frameworks, the categorization is debatable, but they end up within these three points:\n    52→ \n    53→- **Evidence**: phenomena or truth (depending on philosophical position)\n    54→- **A priori justification**: justified belief or truth (sometimes phenomena, depending on philosophical position)\n    55→- **Innate cognitive structures**: manifest only through shaping phenomena we experience, thus phenomenon-based in practice\n    56→- **Prior justified beliefs**: justified belief\n    57→- **Coherence with belief system**: justified belief\n    58→- **Testimony**: phenomena or other's justified belief (known through phenomena)\n    59→- **Norms or virtues**: justified belief or truth (depending on philosophical position)\n    60→- **Mathematical or logical principles**: justified belief or truth (depending on philosophical position)\n    61→- **Reliable processes**: phenomena or truth\n    62→\n    63→The key point is that for each justification basis, we must think about how we access it, instead of what is it. Things that are not accessible cannot be used as a starting point in practical justification. For example, to access intuition, intuition needs to manifest in one of three ways.\n    64→\n    65→### Access\n    66→\n    67→One may question the focus on access. However, if we want to discuss something that happened in real life, we must start with what we actually have access to. Something we can not access is irrelevant to us.\n    68→\n    69→### Phenomena\n    70→\n    71→If readers are confused about the usage of \"phenomena,\" it refers to what we experience or observe.\n    72→\n    73→### Knowledge in motion\n    74→\n    75→A classical question in the definition of knowledge is scientific progress. Clearly, people seem to be looking for a \"proof\" that science is making progress. First, the idea that science is making progress (e.g., modern medicine is better than witchcraft) is itself a belief. In fact, any idea like \"some beliefs are better than others\" is a belief. Second, in a particular field, there is usually a \"standard,\" which is essentially a set of beliefs about \"which beliefs are better.\" In modern science, the \"standard\" is typically that a better belief is one that can be justified by phenomena (using a set of rules of interpretation). This \"standard\" naturally prioritizes beliefs that are more likely to predict phenomena (i.e., its utility). People who believe in other \"standards\" that prioritize phenomena in some sense are then likely to hold the belief that \"science is making progress.\" If we wish to live a better life, it seems that we should, in practice, discuss the standards we are actually using and how we want to change them, since what we thought to be better is itself a standard.\n    76→\n    77→To see the method discussed in this note in motion, let us examine how experiments in the field of high energy physics work. As we now commonly consider as knowledge, there are fundamental particles like the Higgs boson, neutrinos, etc. However, these particles are never directly observed; instead, particle interactions produce electromagnetic signals in detectors. These signals are then used through a reconstruction with different physics models, and the \"best\" model wins as it matches (predicts) the signal pattern. This model is known as the Standard Model, which most physicists now agree on. Readers should be able to map each element of this process to the concepts illustrated in this note.\n    78→\n    79→### Access to truth\n    80→\n    81→In mathematics, mathematicians typically do not have access to math as truth directly (if any). Instead, a mathematician (or a student) proves something starting from some starting point, i.e., what is taken to be true, and then works from there by piecing them together using method that is taken to be true. A piece of proof is accepted by another mathematician if it aligns with the standards they hold as beliefs, typically including checking that the starting points, together with the methods, are believed to be acceptable and that it does not contradict a set of other theories that are considered true by this mathematician.\n    82→\n    83→If some mathematicians have direct access to truth, when they use it in proofs, they must understand truth as a human does, which is then converted into beliefs. On the other hand, as long as not all mathematicians have direct access to truth, knowledge must still be something knowable by those without direct access, reverting to the earlier process unless knowledge is exclusively for those with direct access to truth.\n    84→\n    85→In some rare cases, if truth is directly accessible to certain mathematicians in a way that allows it to be used in a proof, mathematicians who do not (yet) have direct access to this truth must convert it into beliefs when reading the proof, thereby reverting to the earlier process. Otherwise, if the truth in the proof does not require digestion by the reader, this proof would provide direct access to the truth, granting anyone who reads it direct access to truth. If such a proof exists, please share!\n    86→\n    87→### The other option: circular justified beliefs\n    88→\n    89→If we accept circular justification and all knowledge is justified (i.e., the other option in the main text), then all knowledge that a human knows is grounded on some circularly justified beliefs. This suggests that humans are born with some innate circular justified beliefs so that every other piece of knowledge can have a base, meaning babies have knowledge.\n    90→\n    91→If babies have knowledge, then this knowledge has to be justified, as we are working with the condition that all knowledge is justified. This suggests either justification before-life or maybe some sort of instantaneous simultaneous justification at birth (since you cannot justify them sequentially), like a glitch in video games.\n    92→\n    93→If we have a before-life (and it needs to be a before-life of which we have knowledge), we would still need to justify some knowledge at the birth of the before-life (or change our definition of knowledge to the one in the main text for before-life and change it back for this life), suggesting instantaneous simultaneous justification in before-life. Otherwise, we need to accept an infinite chain of before-life or a chain of circular life (and we cannot discuss how to start the circle of lives) while some knowledge can be preserved in between for both cases. This is a position that most religions or mythologies do not hold, and most concepts of the before-life in those religions typically cannot preserve knowledge.\n    94→\n    95→In summary, if we accept circular justification and all knowledge is justified, then babies have knowledge. And we also need to accept one of the following: some sort of instantaneous simultaneous justification that we do not understand, an infinite chain of before-life, or a chain of circular life, while the latter two preserve knowledge.\n    96→\n    97→### The third option: infinite regress\n    98→\n    99→Agrippa's Trilemma proposes a third option, known as infinite regress. For those who are confused by this, please note that infinite justification cannot occur in finite real life.\n   100→\n   101→[^1]: Originally published at https://azhe.io/blog/A-Thought-on-Knowledge\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

24→接下来，我们将定义一系列的转换函子，并以其引出数个$\\mathbb{E}_t$的子范畴（境）。\n    25→\n    26→首先，我们可以从$\\mathbb{E}_t$中“抽取”出一些特定的境：\n    27→$$\n    28→(F_{E,L})_t: (\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\to \\mathbb{E}_t\n    29→$$\n    30→这是一个嵌入函子（inclusion），其中 $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$ 是某一时刻主观语言结构的范畴，是 $\\mathbb{E}_t$ 的子范畴。\n    31→\n    32→我们还可以对不同的境做转换：\n    33→$$\n    34→(F_{L \\to M})_t: (\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\to (\\mathcal{E}_M)_t\n    35→$$\n    36→其中 $(\\mathcal{E}_M)_t$ 是主观时刻 $t$ 下的数学结构范畴。\n    37→\n    38→类似地，可以定义：\n    39→$$\n    40→(F_{E,M})_t: (\\mathcal{E}_M)_t \\to \\mathbb{E}_t\n    41→$$\n    42→\n

E_t$的某种稳定结构\n    55→\n    56→接下来，我们做出一个猜想：在 $T$ 函子的演化中，例如从演化 $\\mathbb{E}_{t_a}\\to\\mathbb{E}_{t_a+1}\\to\\cdots\\mathbb{E}_{t_b-1}\\to\\mathbb{E}_{t_b}$ 中，应该存在某种稳定结构（不知道是什么结构）被保持在每一个$\\mathbb{E}_{t_i}$中，我们暂把其写作$S_E$，并且这个结构具有某种不变性。也就是说，这种不变性在 $T$ 中以某种方式是可以被识别出来的，因为$T$保持他。虽然我们可能很难找到它。\n    57→\n    58→倘若包含在上述演化中的某一个时刻$t_c$所对应的$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$是所有$\\mathbb E_{t}$当中拥有对象最少的（或许这是人一生中的某一个极早时刻），那么这意味着这一稳定结构至多即是某个$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$中的稳定结构，我们把在这种选择下的稳定结构写作$S_{E_c}$。如果你认为这一时刻是某种$\\mathbb E_t$首次出现的时刻，因此有可能独立于经验与感官印象，则你可以将这种稳定结构当中的这一部分认定为“先天”。进一步的，如果你认为$\\mathbb{E}$表示了某种认知，那么假如能够证明这一稳定结构当中的一部分一旦缺失，则无法从$\\mathfrak P_t$中构建任何$\\mathbb{E}_{t}$，则可以将这部分稳定结构称之为“认知结构”。由此，这意味着，在一些哲学框架下，这一稳定结构当中的一部分即有可能是“先天认知结构”[^1]。倘若我们更加平凡的选取$t_a$和$t_b$，不要求演化中包含这样特定的$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$，我们则可以寻找到到更大的和不同的$S_E$，其中则可能除了$S_{E_c}$之外还有其他的（但可能与之相关的）稳定结构，在一些哲学框架下，这些稳定结构可以被认为是后天构建的认知框架。\n    59→\n    60→进一步，在 $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$ 的演化中也应该存在某种稳定结构，这种结构就是我们平时所说的“限定语法规则”之类的东西。\n    61→\n    62→我们已经知道，直接研究 $\\mathbb{E}_t$ 以及 $T_t$ 的演化是困难的。但是我们已经有了函子：\n    63→$$\n    64→(F_{E,L})_t: (\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\to \\mathbb{E}_t\n    65→$$\n    66→这样，我们就可以设想存在某种稳定结构 $S_L$ 在 $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$ 中稳定出现，同时存在某种结构 $S_E$ 在 $\\mathbb{E}_t$ 中保持稳定。通过 $(F_{E,L})_t$（或者某种其他的$(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\to \\mathbb{E}_t$的函子，例如针对某句特定的话内省，当我们看到一句话时其导致我们内心的反应），我们就有可能可以建立一个结构之间的映射关系去至少部分的获取有关 $S_E$ 的信息：\n    67→$$\n    68→(F_{E,L})_t(S_L) \\approx S_E\n    69→$$\n    70→于是我们就可以通过语言游戏研究语言演化中的稳定结构 $S_L$，来间接获得对 $\\mathbb{E}_t$ 中 $S_E$ 的认识，也就是明晰他在感受的范畴之中和其他感受的联系。我们的核心假设是$(F_{E,L})_t(S_L)$和$S_E$至少有一部分重叠。\n    71→\n    72→虽然在这里我们以语言游戏为例，在更好的情况下，我们可以对数个不同的境，例如 $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$ 和 $(\\mathcal{E}_M)_t$等等进行这样的操作，那么通过他们的集合$\\{(F_{E,i})_t(S_i)\\}_i$，我们将能够或许有机会进一步接近$S_E$。事实上，如果我有两个能够以某种形式化的方法（在这里我们的选择是范畴论）去描述的境$(\\mathcal{E}_A)_t$和$(\\mathcal{E}_B)_t$，并且我能够将其中的对象在两个境内进行转换，也就是存在某种$(F_{A \\to B})_t$或者$(F_{B \\to A})_t$，那么，我们之后将会论证，这样的$(F_{A \\to B})_t$必然需要途径$\\mathbb E_t$而捕捉到一部分$\\mathbb E_t$当中到稳定结构。也就是$\\mathbb E_t$中必然存在某些“可被多种形式系统共同描述”的结构，因而这部分稳定结构必然可以用某种形式化的方法（在这里是范畴论）描述。\n    73→\n    74→除了针对$S_E$，我们也可以对其他的存在于$\\mathbb E_t$中的某些结构做类似的研究。这也同时给出了为什么语言游戏作为哲学治疗是有效的，并且将其扩展到其他非语言的境中。\n    75→\n    76→注意到，这里的稳定结构仅仅是描述性的，并且在一些场景下可能具有一定的实用性，但他是否具有某种形而上意义，是否到来某种价值论，例如是否应当追求他，在此我们并未得出结论。\n    77→\n    78→## K1策略：知识的发生\n    79→\n    80→本章节的目的，在于描述语言本身的结构，如何逼迫知识结构的形成。也就是说，某些语言形式似乎强制性地要求我们建立某种特定的“信念–证实”网络， 语言不是只是表达已知知识，而是一种知识验证框架，甚至反向促成了知识结构的构建。一些语句试图“拉出”一组态射，或者指出其断裂：语言行为（如对话、辩护、叙事）要求我们给出论证关系，于是我们开始构造知识结构本身。\n    81→\n    82→接下来考虑$(\\mathcal E_K)_t$，即某一时刻的知识结构。一个形象的理解是其中的对象为信念，射态为证实关系（注意证实关系是一种信念，即是我们认可什么样的论证方式）。我们可以类似$(\\mathcal E_ L)_t$的构造相关的射态和$\\mathcal E_L$。尤为重要的是，存在某种函子\n    83→$$\n    84→(F_{L \\to K})_t: (\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\to (\\mathcal{E}_K)_t\n    85→$$\n    86→即是某一些语句，可以对应某一存在于知识网络中的信念。因为这两个范畴都存在于$\\mathbb E_t$中，因此函子本身作为高阶射态也可以存在于$\\mathbb E_t$中（因为境是塔式结构）。幸运的是，这一函子对于许多人来说恰好确实存在。我们可以通过自省来验证该函子的存在：当我们阅读某句话时，是否能够感受到思想内关于这句话所描述信念的存在，并且确认这一信念在知识网络中的位置：他会令自己联想到哪些其他的信念。\n    87→\n    88→接下来，我们考虑如下过程，通过玩语言游戏，我们构造了在$(\\mathcal{E}_L)_{t}$中的新语句$a$。我们马上可以自省以使用$(F_{L \\to K})_t$将该语句映射为一信念，并在接下来的时刻（$t'$之前）尝试构建知识网络。我们注意到，类似于$(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$，$(\\mathcal E_K)_t$有其内部的某种稳定结构$S_L$，这一稳定结构可以由$(\\mathcal E_K)_t$的演化中识别。而“将该语句映射为一信念并尝试构建知识网络”就是知识范畴的演化过程。根据是否能保持这一特定的稳定结构，$a$所对应的信念将被接受或者拒绝，两种情况都将导致$(\\mathcal E_K)_t$演化为$(\\mathcal E_K)_{t'}$，并且他可能等同或者不等同于$(\\mathcal E_K)_t$（也就是说，即便拒绝，演化后的知识网络不包含$a$所对应的信念，这一演化过程也可能对知识网络产生扰动）。当$a$对应的信念成为$(\\mathcal E_K)_{t'}$的对象时，知识就发生了。\n    89→\n    90→在这一过程中，有两个地方有可能会使用到$\\mathbb{E}_t$中的稳定结构$S_E$。首先，函子$(F_{L \\to K})_t$有可能是通过函子$(F_{E,L})_t$和$(F_{E,K})_t$构建的，例如：\n    91→$$\n    92→(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,L})_t} \\mathbb{E}_t \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,K})_t^{-1}} (\\mathcal{E}_K)_t\n    93→$$\n    94→由此在$(F_{L \\to K})_t$的过程中，由于上一章节的原因，使用（途经/穿过）了$\\mathbb{E}_t$中的$S_E$。或者，函子$(F_{L \\to K})_t$需要通过$\\mathbb{E}_{t}$的演化来生成新的信念感受$a$，然后尝试将其加入知识网络，也就是说，我们可以把$(F_{L \\to K})_t$定义为\n    95→$$\n    96→(F_{L \\to K})_t=(F_{E,K})_{t+1}^{-1} \\circ T_t \\circ (F_{E,L})_t\n    97→$$\n    98→这里使用$\\circ$表示函子的组合以防止歧义。用另一种表达方式，我们可以说：\n    99→$$\n   100→(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,L})_t} \\mathbb{E}_{t+1} \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,K})_{t+1}^{-1}} (\\mathcal{E}_K)_{t+2}\n   101→$$\n   102→此时应当将$(F_{L \\to K})_t$认为是某种特定的开始于时刻$t$的内省过程，并且此处$(F_{E,L})_t$是$T_t$的限制（restriction，可以理解为“子函子”：$(F_{E,L})_t=T_t|_{(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t}$）。不论采用哪种记号，都在$(F_{L \\to K})_t$中都有演化过程，其中可以识别出$S_E$。其次，$(\\mathcal E_K)_t$的演化，遵照上一章节的描述，其内部的特定稳定结构应当可以构成同$S_E$的函子。\n   103→\n   104→最后，这意味着我们可以通过玩语言游戏明晰$S_K$。\n   105→\n   106→## 策略K1：自然变换\n   107→\n   108→我们接下里考虑观察到的他人、语言、数学等对感受到影响。接下来，我将先用数学语言进行描述，然后根据在K1形式中的定义进行解释。我们以数学为例，考虑以下两条路径从 $(\\mathcal{E}_M)_t$ 到 $\\mathbb{E}_{t+1}$：\n   109→\n   110→1.  \n   111→$$\n   112→(\\mathcal{E}_M)_t

141→为了方便理解，让我们使用一个公式$a$的例子：“1+1”$\\xrightarrow{T_M}$“1+1=2”。\n   142→\n   143→注意到，由于$\\eta_a$是$\\mathbb E_t$中的射态，因此它是一种体验。也就是说我们有机会能够通过内省去获得他：\n   144→- 左边（domain）描述当我们看到“1+1”后我们对其进行思考后得到的体验\n   145→- 右边（codomain）描述\"1+1\"遵照数学规律演化为\"1+1=2\"，我们看到了\"1+1=2\"后的体验\n   146→\n   147→也就是说，$\\eta_a$ 是一种在体验中，我们看到 “1+1” 后对其进行思考后所产生的那种感受，与我们看到 “1+1=2” 时所感到的那种感受之间的链接感受。它就像是我们做完一道数学题后，对照参考答案时所经历的那种“确认过程”的体验。我们可以将 $\\eta_a$ 理解为：通过数学结构对思考进行确认的过程，其对应的感受。\n   148→\n   149→特殊地，当 $\\eta_a$ 是单位元时，意味着我们对 “1+1” 的思考结果所带来的感受，与我们直接看到 “1+1=2” 时的感受完全一致，不需要经过任何额外思考来完成确认。就像是我们对照答案时，一眼就意识到自己的解答与参考答案完全一致，不需要任何过程就直接意识到自己脑海当中的推导是对的的那种感觉。是那种无需中介、直接闭合的“直接确认感”。我们可以将这种情况称之为对$a$对掌握。\n   150→\n   151→\n   152→接下来，我们理解自然性条件。\n   153→$$\n

161→为了获得更加直觉的理解，让我们使用两个常见的特例来理解这一公式。首先取$f$为某个固定的可逆的（充分必要的）推导关系，也就是说他在函子$T_M$的演化下不变（即我们不使用数学规律把他变为另一种形式）。此时关于这样的$f$的自然性条件可以化简为\n   162→$$\n   163→\\eta_a = \\hat{f}^{-1}_{t+1} \\circ  \\eta_{a'} \\circ T(\\hat{f}_t) \n   164→$$\n   165→其中 $\\hat{f}_t = (F_{E,M})_t(f)$（即 $f$ 在 $\\mathbb{E}_t$ 中的嵌入），以及 $\\hat{f}_{t+1} = (F_{E,M})_{t+1}(f)$（即 $f$ 在 $\\mathbb{E}_{t+1}$ 中的嵌入）。\n   166→\n   167→如果$T(\\hat

171→此时可以证明$\\eta_a$和$\\eta_{a'}$都必须为单位元。这意味着，如果$a$和$a'$在数学上可以通过某种数学关系相互推导（$f:a\\rightarrow a'$且$f$可逆），并且你能稳定的在脑海中重现这种推导过程（$T(\\hat f_t)=\\hat f_{t+1}$）。那么如果你已经掌握了$a'$，则掌握$a$（即获得对$a$的直接确认感）就需要是\n   172→1. 你把$a$按照你脑海当中的推导过程$f$推导为$a'$，\n   173→2. 无需过程就意识到$a'$是对的，\n   174→3. 然后由$a'$重新推出$a$的过程。\n   175→\n   176→如果我无法通过这一过程获取对$a$的直接确认感，则自然性条件不满足。注意到，最后一步由$a'$重新推出$a$的过程是必要的。因为我们可能会偶然地从不理解的结构推出一个简单结果，但却无法从该结果返回推理出原结构的合理性。在这种情况下，我们并不会感觉我们真正“掌握”了 $a$，因为我们无法从已知结构自然地产生出对它的确认体验。\n   177→\n   178→接下来，如果$f$为某个固定的不可逆的（即充分但不必要的）推导关系，此时自然性条件为\n   179→$$\n   180→\\hat{f}_{t+1} \\circ \\eta_a = \\eta_{a'} \\circ T(\\hat{f}_t)\n   181→$$\n   182→注意此时$\\eta_a$和$\\eta_{a'}$不一定是单位元。如果$T(\\hat

在等式左边描述成功数学确认$a$后，能够在脑海内使用推到过程从$a$推出$a'$\n   188→- 在等式右边能够在脑海内使用推导过程从$a$推出$a'$后成功对$a'$使用数学进行确认，\n   189→\n   190→我们打一个生活中的比方，想象一个游戏，游戏只有两个选项，选择一项为正确，另一项为错误。如果$a$为游戏攻略中的指南，而$a'$为具体在游戏中的正确操作。如果我能稳定的从指南中描述的游戏玩法推断出具体操作，则\n   191→- 我在玩游戏前游戏攻略确认了玩法，然后在玩的时候从玩法规则在脑内正确的推演了我现在具体要怎么操作\n   192→- 我没有看看游戏攻略确认玩法，直接用印象中的玩法在脑内推演我现在的操作，然后我通过游戏的结果进行确认我的操作\n   193→这两个不同路径能够稳定地达到同样的效果，即是我正确操作并通过了游戏。如果我记错了游戏玩法，那么前者能够通过游戏，而后者则不能；如果游戏在发布攻略后修改了游戏玩法，则前者不能通过游戏，而后者则有可能通过。也就是说，自然性条件可以理解为要求某个范畴的演化和内部感受的演化的一致性：即是说，自然性要求“你以为这个游戏怎么玩”和“这个游戏实际上怎么玩”这两者之间相互契合，这一契合通过对操作结果（作为现象）的确认是否成立，即是否存在$\\eta$，达成。\n   194→\n   195→最后，当$f$在$T_M$下有变换时，类似上面的描述，可以理解为这一变换必须要和我们在脑海中设想的他的变换兼容。\n   196→\n   197→当我们把这一框架使用在语言上，我们可以得到一个经典问题的描述性解答：对于语言来说，是结构先于意义，还是意义先于结构？如果我们认为句子的意义是某一段语言所引发的心理过程，那么我们现在知道，结构和意义之间的关系是自然变换：一句话能够被理解，他必须能够在心理过程的演化和结构的演化中达成如上所述的这种一致性感受$\\eta$，一种对齐。\n   198→- 从语言的角度来说，也就是说如果我们只能改变一个句子的句法结构，那么这个句子要被理解，他必须要“回应”某种给定的心理过程；\n   199→- 从心理的角度来说，也就是说如果我们只能尝试改变自身的心理状态，那么要能读懂一个给定的句子，我们也必须要改变我们的心理状态去“回应”这个句子的结构。\n   200→\n   201→进一步的，我们现在可以做出如下猜测：当你看到一个东西，并且认为你懂这个东西，这意味着这个东西的结构演化与你自身的经验演化之间确立了一个自然变换。形象的说，当你看到“猫跳上了桌子”这句话。这句话在语言中的构造有着固定的演化结构（例如遵照主谓宾的构造方法），而你在逐字阅读这句话的过程（也就是句子演化逐步展开），你在你的脑海中也模拟了这个动作，在脑中看到猫移动、跃起、落到桌上。当这两个演化结构对齐时，你就感到你理解了这句话，而你脑海中的这个过程就被认为是这句话所表达的意义。而当我们无法构建这种自然变换时，例如，当你看到“你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国，记住我给出的原理”，而无法在脑海完成某个对应的的心理过程以同这句话对齐时，你就无法获得“我懂了”的这个感受。\n   202→\n   203→另一方面，如果你通过网络搜索理解了这句话的发生场景，作为meme的意义，当你再次阅读这句话时，虽然你无法从语法的角度理解他，但是你却能够从网络文化的角度获得“我懂了”的感受。这是因为在文化的范畴上这句话的展开（例如他的使用背景、传播方式、引用逻辑）能够以某种对齐的方式在你的心理过程中展开，由此构建了某种代表一致性的感受$\\eta$。\n   204→\n   205→也就是说，“我懂了”并不是对某句话本身的“本体性确认”，而是对$\\eta$所代表的一致性的那种“体验确认”。当我看到一个东西，我是否理解他，取决于这个东西在我的经验结构中是否能被嵌入到某个已理解的结构系统中，并与这个东西的演化之间获得$\\eta$的感受以建立自然变换。\n   206→\n   207→进一步的说，当我们“感受”到他人的感受、明细了某个现象的“意义”时，例如说，当我意识到，这对情侣是真的相爱的时，我感受到的并不是某种实体性的“爱”，而是当我看到这对情侣的互动后，这些现象和我脑海中的经验与模式“共振”，并帮助我最终抵达、或者创造了我的脑海中那个关于“爱”的感受。\n   208→\n   209→## KA猜想：某种稳定结构\n   210→\n   211→最后，让我们考虑$\\mathbb E_t$的子范畴中的稳定结构。\n   212→\n   213→考虑某一个$\\mathbb E_t$中的子范畴$(\\mathcal E_i)_t$，这一子范畴在演化下将保有某种稳定结构$S_i$，如同先前所叙述的。我们现在假设这一稳定结构是某种子范畴，即$S_i$是$\\{(\\mathcal E_i)_{t_j}\\}_j$中每个范畴的子范畴。数学上我们有许多手段去寻找$S_i$，例如寻找不变子范畴，要求$T$或者$T_i$在$S_i$上的作用是恒等或自然等价。在这里我们使用极限（limit）或余极限（colimit）做尝试。\n   214→\n   215→> Todo: KA猜想\n   216→> 这一章节的核心意图是论证在某些假设下，可以推导出《范畴论与境》A1策略中给出的形而上概念作为范性质的定义，（注意到，K1策略并没有使用塔式构造，也没有使用形而上作为范性质的定义。）。也就是说，形而上概念之所以形成，是因为他形成了体验中的某些稳定结构，并且这些稳定结构作为子范畴当中具有某一种范性质，而这一范性质就是我们所以为的那种“本质”，一种“实体”的感觉。进一步的，在这样明晰了形而上的具体结构后，我们可以论证为什么有的体验能够被形而上，而有一些则不行或者较为困难，也就是到底哪些是有效的子范畴（例如我们如何和为什么能从$\\mathbb E$中构造$\\mathcal E_L$）。我们这里可以用笔作为例子，描述我们见到的笔的现象如何聚合为一种“笔”的“物理实体”，然后再如何由诸多的具体的“笔”构成理想的“笔”的概念。进一步的，在最好的情况下，可以通过哲学实验去经验性的验证起点的假设。同样的，这也可以用于明晰概念如何通过境的演化而产生，迁移，和整合。\n   217→> \n   218→> 这或许也是寻找$S_E$的一种方法，当子范畴被选定为整个$\\mathbb E_t$：极限的泛性质是说：对于任何其他范畴X，如果X也有到这个演化链中每个范畴的函子，并且这些函子与演化函子$T_t$相容，那么存在唯一的函子从X到极限范畴。\n   219→> \n   220→> 最后，还可以寻找一种定义方法定义“张力”。张力是指的某种无法确定唯一终对象的状态。这一察觉来源于语言的使用当中，存在一些逻辑和结构使得一句话“说完了”，不论是在文法上还是在表达上。例如说，当论证完成，逻辑达成闭环时，就意味着论证的终止；当我们诉说完对一个事情的抱怨，不再有任何更多的抱怨以抱怨时，就意味着某些话说完了。与之对应的是一种“完满的感觉”。也就是说，存在一种东西，这个东西是所有语言中的子范畴的终对象的对象。我们可以使用内省作为函子回到$\\mathbb E_t$，于是这意味着当一个形而上指向这一终对象时，我们就感到这一形而上完满、一致和结束，我们把这种感受写作$T$。也就是说，如果有一些感受无法被联想到一个范性质时，例如有多个潜在的范性质可能，但是没有完全满足范性质的条件，我们就无法取得$T$。就像是我们被几个不同的逻辑或者价值观卡住而无法做出决定一样（比如说“救对象还是救爸妈”）。\n   221→> \n   222→> 因为语言的范畴的演化是不断说完话的过程，那么感受的演化也就至少一部分是不断“企图获取”$T$的过程。也就是说，如果我们用“目的”这一框架来描述这一过程，那么在这种意味上，我们为什么要不断、继续的讨论哲学，正是因为在一些哲学的领域我们无法找到或者构建一个范性质以获取$T$。这也是哲学治疗为什么有效的原因。\n   223→> \n   224→> 从另一个角度来讲，小孩子的$\\mathfrak P_t$通常比成年人的要小，因此小孩通常容易在$\\mathbb E_t$中获取和构建连接到$T$的感受，因而小孩更容易取得完满的感受。当小孩长大，$\\mathbb E_t$中的内容越来越多，射态越来越复杂，就有可能有更少比例的感受指向$T$，因而较难取得完满的感受，也就是也就是张力。如果在成长过程中，他能够理清思绪或者寻找到某中框架使得大部分感受指向$T$，那么他就又获得了取回$T$的能力，甚至能够主动的整理和构建自己的感受以主动的获取$T$。\n   225→> \n   226→> 注意到，我们在这里依旧是描述性的。人是否应当不断的获取$T$，抑或是人应当怎么看待$T$，$T$是否意味着某种人的意义，未获取$T$的状态是否具有价值，是否我们应该去避免获取$T$，我们在这里并未做出像这样本体论或者价值论的判断。\n   227→> \n   228→> 关于$T$我还有另一点猜想，那就是$T$可能来源于人对边界的识别，也就是说，在《后形而上学》当中，人所具有的那种分与和的能力，能够把视觉信息中把近似的红色的东西归于一块，认为这是一个东西，和周围的东西不是同一个东西的那个能力。在生理上，可以认为这个能力部分来源于人感官的不精确性（合），在思想上，可以认为这个能力来源于人归纳抽象的能力。也就是说，追求$T$的过程，可以理解为对恒常性的追求。\n   229→> \n   230→> 这也回答了美诺悖论：如果我不知道要学什么，那我怎么学？如果我知道了，为什么还要学？现在我们知道，如果我们无法取得$\\eta$感受，那么我们就会觉得我不完全理解一件事情。这可能是网络中存在空洞导致路径缺失，或者是因为网络存在张力：也就是说我们无法组织网络以获得范性质。那么这时我们就知道了“我不知道”在这个结构中可能存在的某个东西或者某个统一的构造有效子范畴的方式。这就是“我要学的那个东西”，但是她不是我已经学会的东西。当通过整理射态，这一网络中形成了某个泛性质、或者当我们取得新的概念补完路径，获取了$\\eta$，那么我们就觉得我们学会了我们之前想学的那个东西。\n   231→> \n   232→> 进一步的，如果我们能够定义张力，那么我们或许可以由此定义潜在。\n   233→\n   234→\n   235→%% 如果有一个A范畴，这个范畴A里有一个终对象。如果有一个范畴B，并且函子F:A->B。函子本身的性质能够保证A的终对象依旧在B中室终对象或者始对象么？如果不能，F需要具有什么样的性质才可以保证这一点？\n   236→一般地：\n   237→如果 $F$ 是右伴随函子，那么 $F$ 会保所有极限（包括终对象）；\n   238→如果 $F$ 是左伴随函子，则它保所有余极限（包括始对象）。\n   239→ %%\n   240→## K1策略\n   241→\n   242→我们在这里概括K1策略尝试中所构建的几个方法论\n   243→1. 利用转换函子，我们可以将具有良好形式化范畴中的一些结构映射到其他较难研究的范畴中，通过研究前者探索后者当中的某些结构。这是事实上是大部分哲学研究，例如语言游戏，已经在使用的方法，我们现在给这一方法提供了一种结构表达与描述性解释。\n   244→2. 根据K1形式中给定的定义，我们可以对范畴论得到的数学结果进行解读，其解读结果可能是一些哲学论断。\n   245→3. 如果有某一存在于$\\mathbb E$中的对象或者射态（例如前叙的$\\eta_a$），则它是一种体验。并且我们有可能有机会能够通过内省去获得他。进一步的，我们能够通过构建恰当符合结构的例子去唤醒读者的某一种特定的体验。一旦这一例子得以可重复的在不同读者中确立，那么我们等同于进行了一场“哲学实验”，并得以在实践中对相关的哲学论断进行一定程度的验证。需要强调，我们不需要本体论的验证不同的人获得了“同一”体验（例如Qualia），只需要他们他们具有相同的结构性位置。\n   246→4. 更进一步的，如果我们将这种方法应用于不同的人群，我们或许可以获取跨人群、时间、文化的体验差异和共性。例如，倘若有某一体验能够在成年人中被稳定的唤醒，而在儿童中却较为困难，这或许揭示了某种认知结构的发展机制。倘若有某一体验能够在有神论者中被稳定唤醒，而在无神论者中却较为困难，（或者我们无法找到具有显著性的像这样例子），这或许揭示了宗教体验和理解如何构建认知结构。也就是说，部分哲学问题可以被重新表达为“哪些结构在什么人群中可被诱发”，以及“为什么有些结构在某些人群中无法形成”。哲学结构如果在经验中有稳定呈现，就可以通过实践的心理手段作为验证机制进行经验性验证[^2]。在最好的情况下，某一哲学论断对应的范畴论命题可以由在$\\mathbb E$中的某些对象和射态的存在性推出，并且可以通过设计实验，验证这些感受可以通过符合特定结构的思想实验、文学、音乐、画面、影像、互动游戏等方式进行稳定的唤醒，并且被唤醒的体验处于预计的结构上的位置，由此获得这一哲学论断的经验性验证。\n   247→\n   248→最后，我想要强调，本文所得出的结论是描述性的。例如说，我只是描述性的指出可能存在形如$S_{E_c}$这样的稳定结构和其所处的结构性位置，但是他的本体论地位，是否等同于许多哲学框架中的“先天认知结构”，本文并未得出结论。\n   249→\n   250→但是，一旦我们用结构描述出某些认知结构与经验形态，我们就获得了与之相关的那些引导体验、激发理解、构造认知路径的能力。我们不仅仅可以在实践中对他们进行验证和使用，我们还可以利用他们进行推演和衍生，并在实践中确立新的感受和构建新的结构。\n   251→\n   252→## 写在最后\n   253→\n   254→我想要在最后对在方法论中作为“哲学实验”的核心过程做出一些解释：通过构造特定的结构以唤起相应的体验，以此来查明这一体验所处的结构性位置，并最终将这一结论实践和延展，并以此稳定的唤醒和构造体验。这一过程并不仅仅局限于在本文的框架中使用范畴论来描述结构。事实上，诗歌、文学、艺术、音乐、建筑、游戏、烹饪、旅游、meme等等活动都在不断的进行这一过程，使用各自不同的“语言”以描述结构，只是我们在这里使用了范畴论作为这一工具，一个脚手架，但“哲学实验”的实践是广泛的，并且我们可以观察到他广泛的存在于基本的人类活动之中，我们不断的进行境的构建、体验和演化。一个基本的例子：母亲哄孩子睡觉需要设计声音和节奏的结构以构建某种境来唤醒睡意。也就是说，从某种意义上来说，“You have already made the choice. You are here to try to understand why and how you made it”，我们常常已经选择和构建了产生特定感受和体验的境，我们只是有时候不知道为什么（例如忘记了境是何时或怎么被构建的）我们会最终得到这一体验。如果想要明晰我们对生活、自身、和周遭的困惑，我们可以有察觉的注意到这一点，并尝试理解其内部过程，理清这一切是如何发生。我在这里使用的范畴论仅仅是工具的一种，我们已经有许多现成的工具可以帮助我们达成这一点，并且各有所长。\n   255→\n   256→最后，不论读者是否阅读过，我都邀请读者带着对境的理解再次重新阅读我在2022年写的《[[形而上学后的目的：诗意]]》。这篇文章即是“境”的概念被我第一次提出的时候。\n   257→\n   258→## 一些额外猜想\n   259→\n   260→基于本文的猜想，这意味着，如果我们能够给定一组$S_E$和与其兼容的现象集$\\mathfrak P$，那么我们就可以以他为约束生成$\\mathbb E_t$和其演化。即是任何加入$\\mathbb E_t$的对象和射态所导致的$\\mathbb E_t$的演化都必须保证$S_E$的稳定存在，同$S_E$兼容。这意味着，根据$S_E$的不同，我们可以或许可以构造出，至少是现象上来说，具有认知结构的不同实体。一个可能的候选是以某种Homotopy Type Theory的框架作为$S_E$。\n   261→\n   262→[^1]: 注意到，这里有一个问题，那就是$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$时就已经有$\\mathfrak P_{t_c}$，我们不知道$\\mathfrak P$是否在$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$之前就已经存在。进一步的，因为$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$中已经有现象，因此$S_E$当中也可能有现象。换而言之，我们有几种理解先天认知结构的方法。我们这里列出几种，一种是先天认知结构是一种存在于任何现象之前的东西$\\mathbb E_{0}$，$\\mathbb E_{0}$和$\\mathfrak P_{t_c}$共同决定了$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$；另一种是现象的可能形式是由先天认知结构$\\mathbb E_{0}$所决定的，即$\\mathbb E_{0}$决定了$\\mathfrak P_{t_c}$再产生$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$；还有一种是我们认为先天认知结构就是现象的形式，那么$\\mathfrak P_{t_c}$当中就已经包含了先天认知结构。如此等等。注意到，$\\mathbb E_{0}$不在$\\mathfrak P_{t_c}$之中，而$\\mathfrak P_{t_c}$是我们所能探索的边界，因此我们无法对$\\mathbb E_{0}$进行探查。不论如何理解，这些看法只是对$S_E$对本体论位置进行确认，我们事实上能查明的最小稳定结构就是$S_E$。\n   263→[^2]: 注意到，这是一个关于经验的分析判断：如果一个东西在经验中有稳定呈现，就可以进行经验性验证。\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

107→注意到，每一步我们不需要构造所有可能的对象，我只需要构造一些特定对象，只要最终求得的我们要构构造的$\\mathcal T$即可。\n   108→\n   109→我们将这两种构造方法称之为*塔式构造*，不一定所有的塔式结构都可以通过塔式构造重构出来，但是塔式结构中的某一子范畴总可以用塔式构造重构。塔式构造只是一种构造方法，许多时候，这一范畴$\\mathcal T$是一开始就是给定的。这是这就像地图和地形的关系：地形早就在那里，我们只是选择不同的方式来绘制地图。如果$\\mathcal T$已经实现给定，塔式构造是一种\"制图法\"，而不是在创造新地形。\n   110→\n   111→我们说某对象$A \\in \\text{Obj}_\\mathcal{T_\\infty}$是绝对a元阶（absolute a-th meta

\\text{Obj}_\\mathcal{T_\\infty}$相对于某绝对b元阶对象$B \\in \\text{Obj}_\\mathcal{T_\\infty}$（$b>a$）是b-a+1元阶的（$\\text{MetaOrder}_B(A) = |\\text{MetaOrder}(B)| - |\\text{MetaOrder}(A)| +1$）。\n   114→\n   115→显然的，给定一个绝对1元阶对象$R$，则任意绝对n元阶对象$A \\in \\text{Obj}_\\mathcal{T_\\infty}$相对$R$是n元阶的。我们将$R$称之为基石，当给定一个基石对象时，当我们说某对象$A$是n元阶时，我们即是说的$A$相对于基石对象是n元阶的。\n   116→\n   117→为了方便理解，我举两个例子：\n   118→\n   119→#### 例子：魔法书3\n   120→\n   121→我是一个魔法学院的教授。我那丰富的魔法知识……我变行术的对象，已经不仅仅是动物了。我甚至能够把一种魔法变成另一种魔法，实现魔法之间的相互转化……啊我还记我第一次掌握这个技巧后，学院要我将其整理成魔法书的那个下午……\n   122→\n   123→0. 我从书架上随手抽出了一本魔法书，封面上写着《动物变行术大全——终极绵羊特别版》（$\\mathcal O$）。哦！这可是我写过的第一本魔法教材，这是一个好的开始……\n   124→1. 我铺开羊皮纸，开始撰写我新的魔法书。让我看看之前这本书上开头的两个魔法……哦！是*猫猫*变狗术和**鸭鸭**变狗术。哼……多么的简单！我挥动羽毛笔，写下了——*猫猫*和**鸭鸭**都变狗狗术！这可是在之前的这本书上都没有的全新魔法！（因为之前书上的魔法并没有作用于两个动物身上都有效的魔法）如此简单的任务真是令我发笑！我如法炮制，迅速的写完了这本魔法书——《复合动物变形指南——一年级》（$\\mathcal T_1$）。有了这本书，我也不再需要参考先前的《动物变行术大全——终极绵羊特别版》了。\n   125→2. 我抽出一张新的羊皮纸，这一次，我要为那些高年级的魔法学生写下一点稍微更难一点的魔法——但是也不能太难。我看着刚刚写好的《复合动物变形指南——一年级》，脑海中冒出一个偷懒的想法。我看着先前写好的“*猫猫和鸭鸭*都变狗狗术”和“**猪猪和鼠鼠**都变狗狗术”，写出了……没错！是“*猫猫鸭鸭* **猪猪鼠鼠**全都变成狗狗术”！我如法炮制……迅速的写完了这本魔法书——《复合动物变形指南——二年级》，把他放在了《复合动物变形指南——一年级》的旁边。（$\\mathcal T_2$是两册书一起。那些出现在第二册中的魔法的绝对元阶为2。出现在第一册中的魔法的绝对元阶为1。）\n   126→3. 我按照这样的摸鱼方法，开始继续写下一本书。当然！我每次的新书都会参考我从一年级开始的所有书！这能大大提高摸鱼效率。比如说在第一本书里我写过了“*猫猫和鸭鸭*都变狗狗术”，在第二本书里我写过了\"**狮狮虎虎蛙蛙獭獭**全都变成狗狗术\"，那我自然要在第三本里写下“*猫猫鸭鸭* **狮狮虎虎蛙蛙獭獭**大变狗狗术”！。\n   127→4. 如此简单的任务！在那一个下午，我按照相同的套路，摸鱼了——几乎无数本魔法书！\n   128→\n   129→注意到该魔法教授构造新一元阶魔法的方法将会使得在最后一本魔法书中，将有可能包含将所有动物都变成绵羊的真正终极变羊术。但是不会包含把所有动物都变成狗的真正终极变狗术，因为狗在$\\mathcal O$中不是一个终对象。也就是说我们可以推断在这些书当中不存在把羊变成狗的魔法，但是却必然存在把狗变成羊的魔法。\n   130→\n   131→注意到，本质上来说，“*猫猫*和**鸭鸭**都变狗狗术”是为了帮助读者直觉上去理解高阶射态，他实际上是一个把“*猫猫*变狗术”和“**鸭鸭**变狗术”相互转换的魔法。有了这一魔法后，我们自然可以创造一个新的魔法：把“‘*猫猫*变狗’和‘**鸭鸭**变狗’相互转换术”和“*猫猫*变狗术”（或者“**鸭鸭**变狗术”）相互“加”在一起，得到一个“*猫猫*和**鸭鸭**都变狗狗术”。这个“*猫猫*和**鸭鸭**都变狗狗术”和“‘*猫猫*变狗’‘**鸭鸭**变狗’相互转换术’”具有相同的结构，因为每一个“‘*猫猫*变狗’和‘**鸭鸭**变狗’相互转换术”都可以找到一个唯一的“*猫猫*和**鸭鸭**都变狗狗术”。\n

140→> 技术上来说，等同于构造一个coproduct（或者disjoint union）结构。唯一性由coproduct中的范性质保证。\n   141→\n   142→## 境\n   143→\n   144→### P\n   145→\n   146→在讨论形而上时，我曾为了叙述方便，引入了概念P。P即是Phenomenon（现象），也是Physical World（物质世界），或者是Physics（物理法则）。我用P以指代是任何在某理论中被认为是第一实在的东西（例如说，一些人可能会认为P除了物质世界之外，还应当加上（客观的）Spirit World（精神世界）。\n   147→\n   148→本文中，P最终应当指代现象（Phenomenon）。并且我将用“感受”和“体验”一词以指代P中的任何一个部分。其原因在于，即便对于客观世界模型来说，任何对于我们有影响的事物都必须通过“感受”或者“体验”以“进入”我们的“视野”以成为“现象”。因此“全部的感受之总和”既是现象。\n   149→\n   150→在本文中，我将用$\\mathfrak P$以指代完整的P，即是“全部的感受之总和”、完整的现象，而用$\\mathfrak p$以指代某部分的P，例如“所有我从手机中所接受到的信息”。\n   151→\n   152→### E\n   153→\n   154→以P为范例，在这里，我拟用代号E（$\\mathbb E$或$\\mathcal E$）以指代我先前用梦境（境）一词所指的东西。其意味为表示为“内部的”之意（Enclosed），也表示情绪与感受之意（Emotion与Experience）。\n   155→\n   156→### P上的E\n   157→\n   158→现在我们定义$\\mathbb E$。$\\mathbb E$是$\\mathfrak P$上的结构，我们现在**选择**将这种结构用范畴**描述**：我们**选取**$\\mathfrak P$中的部分（感受）**作为**$\\mathbb E$中的对象，其中这些对象之间的联系（称之为联想，也是$\\mathfrak P$的一部分，也是一种感受），**作为**$\\mathbb E$中的态射。\n   159→\n   160→我们同时可以选取$\\mathfrak P$的一部分。例如$\\mathfrak p$，并构造$\\mathfrak p$上的结构$\\mathcal E_\\mathfrak p$。此后我将使用$\\mathcal E$指代$\\mathbb E$或者某些$\\mathfrak p$上的$\\mathcal E_\\mathfrak p$。\n   161→\n   162→注意到，$\\mathcal E$中的态射也是$\\mathfrak P$中的部分（即感受），因此即是说，$\\mathcal E$当中的态射也是$\\mathcal E$中的对象，因此我们可以断言$\\mathcal E$的结构是塔式结构。\n   163→\n   164→注意到，你可以通过内省来**体验**和**验证**这个结构$\\mathcal E$。也就是说，如果想要获取某一个特定的感受$a$，可以以$\\mathcal E$中$a$所处的结构位置作为地图去唤醒这个特定的感受。\n   165→\n   166→#### 附言\n   167→\n   168→值得注意的是，一个更加恰当的描述是使用*纯态射范畴*（arrows-only metacategory）。通过将单位元和其对应对象等同，两者构成相同的数学结构。为了方便理解，这里继续使用常见的范畴的语言。\n   169→\n   170→在数学上，可以认为$\\mathfrak P$是某种意义上在范畴论中常使用的\"universe\"或者Large Categories，不过其边界被限定为给定的P。某种意义上，$\\mathcal E$是对$\\mathfrak P$这种“无结构的大集类”中元素的选取。选取所构成的$\\mathcal E$作为塔式结构中的对象和射态具有相同的地位（正如$\\mathfrak P$中并不区分对象和射态）。通过塔式构造重构$\\mathcal E$即是通过赋予元阶，对塔式结构$\\mathcal E$中的对象赋予了分层结构的过程。这一点将在后续讨论到。\n   171→\n   172→## 形而上：A1策略\n   173→\n   174→A1策略是使用范畴论描述境的一个尝试。\n   175→\n   176→### 联想和形而上\n   177→\n   178→$\\mathcal E$中的态射，如前所述，被称之为联想。例如说，我看到铅笔而想到钢笔，因而联想，做为一个态射，链接了铅笔和钢笔。与此同时，这一联想也作为一个对象而存在于$\\mathcal E$中，即是那个我看到铅笔而想到钢笔的那种“感受”。这种感受可能源于铅笔和钢笔当中的某种**相似性**（一般由感官的模糊性导致）。在这种情况下，遵照先前的魔法书例子，我们可以将许多种**类似**的对象（例如蜡笔、粉笔）和他们两两之间的联想当作是$\\mathcal E$中某种构造中的$\\mathcal T_1$（或者说，我们将这些对象选择作为基石），那么必然在$\\mathcal T_\\infty$中存在某种“终极联想”，即终对象，这个终对象的一个表示即是那种感觉，那种我看到这些**类似**的东西都会感受到的那种感觉（而这种感觉在这种状况下意味着某种终极的**相似性**）——我们把这个感觉叫做*笔*。\n   179→\n   180→注意到，*笔*这一概念是一种对具体的、个别的笔（例如铅笔、或者例如这支我拿在手上的笔）的*形而上*。推而广之，我们给出*形而上*的如下定义：\n   181→\n   182→> 一个*形而上*$m$是$\\mathcal E$中的联想，且$m$在$\\mathcal E$的某个子范畴中是范性质。我们将这个子范畴记作$\\mathcal E_m$，简记成$\\mathcal M$。\n   183→\n   184→注意到，不是所有子范畴内都存在范性质。\n   185→\n   186→#### 例子：忒修斯之船\n   187→\n   188→什么是忒修斯之船（忒修斯之船的本质是什么）？忒修斯之船即是那个我们看到任意的“忒修斯之船的碎片或关联物”（如船的部件）都会联想到的东西（体验）、或是当我们提到时会联想到所有的“忒修斯之船的碎片或关联物”的那个东西（体验）。也就是说，他是某一个体验（$\\mathfrak p_{Theseus}$中的一部分），某一个和这艘船（$\\mathfrak p_{\\text{Theseus}}$中的一部分）上的所有部件都相关的体验。这个特定的体验即是关于忒修斯之船 的$\\mathcal E_{\\text{Theseus}}$的泛性质，是当我们提到忒修斯之船时的“本质”。\n   189→\n   190→如果我们将物理世界作为$\\mathfrak P$，我们可以定义物质意义上的$\\mathcal E$。此时$\\mathcal E$当中的全部对象即是任意忒修斯之船的部分（例如说甲板，和甲板上的这一块和那一块木板，和船舵）。注意到，此时空总是$\\mathcal E$中的对象，也是他的子范畴中的对象。我们不妨将包含关系当作$\\mathcal E$上的态射（他作为对象是什么？），那么此时，_忒修斯之船_（我在这里使用了简记，用*忒修斯之船*以指代$\\mathcal E_{\\text{Theseus}}$）的范性质有两种：始对象即是完整的忒修斯之船（包含了任何一个对象）、终对象即是空（被任何对象所包含）。因此，在如此选定的$\\mathfrak P$上，我们必然会出现忒修斯悖论：\n   191→\n   192→> 如果忒修斯的船上的木头逐渐被替换，直到所有的木头都不是原来的木头，那这艘船还是原来的那艘船吗？\n   193→\n   194→并且我们会得到忒修斯之船的本质即是无这样的谬论——因为无确实是*忒修斯之船*的范性质。这一悖论的原因即是我们对$\\mathfrak P$的错误选取——$\\mathfrak P$应当被选择为现象而非物理世界，因为*忒修斯之船*之形而上并不存在于物理世界，而存在于我们的脑海之中。\n   195→\n   196→同样的，我们注意到，当我们选取$\\mathfrak P$为现象时，$\\mathcal E$上的态射不应单独的选择为包含关系。例如说，当我们追问我是谁的时候，我们常常把自己的特征去掉（如果我不会弹钢琴了，我还是我么？），直至最后得到了“空”这样的答案。倘若以范性质以描述我，“我”是那个感受，那个当你提到任何有关我的方面时，都会让我联想到的那个感受，这个感受即是我。\n   197→\n   198→练习：试分析秃头悖论：当一个人少了多少根头发，我们会认为他秃了？\n   199→\n   200→#### 例子：什么是人？\n   201→\n   202→另外一个例子是“什么是人”。“人”即是当你看到所有你认为是人的时候所想到的，感受到的那个感觉，那个感觉就告诉了你什么是“人”。\n   203→\n   204→但是我们常常还会想要一些更多关于我们认为什么是“人”的信息。那么我们自然可以探索，在以这个感觉作为范性质（形而上）的子范畴中，那些元阶介于这一感觉和看到具体的人之间的那些感受和东西，例如说，有什么样的手、有什么样的脸、有什么样的社会性，等等。\n   205→\n   206→要注意到，这一回答不是本体论的回答，而是实践上的回答：这就是我们在描述我们所认为的“什么是人”的时候唯一能做的事情，正如当小孩问他们的父母，“什么是人？”时，他的父母唯一能做的一样。\n   207→\n   208→#### 例子：对象化（Objectification）\n   209→\n   210→当工人创造其工作成果时，这一行为有时会用对象化一词来形容。有的时候，工人的劳动成果被看作是工人的“我”的一部分。在这个时候，所谓“我的一部分”，其意义在于生产成果是工人认识自身的一种途径：人在劳动成果中“认出自己”，由此，成果不仅属于人，而且是人的延伸，构成人的“现实的我”。\n   211→\n   212→我们在这里提出一种新的，类似的对象化。回想，按照我们的定义：\n   213→\n   214→> “我”是那个感受，那个当你提到任何有关我的方面时，都会让我联想到的那个感受，这个感受即是我。\n   215→\n   216→当工人看到自己的产品时，会感受到这个东西其中自己倾注其中的具体工作和努力，由此会体验和联想到“我”的感受。正如当我们想到我们的身体时，激活了“我”的感受一样，这个产品也成为了“我”的一部分，加入了以“我”作为范性质（形而上）的子范畴中。\n   217→\n   218→### 元阶？\n   219→\n   220→我们注意到，$\\mathcal E$是$\\mathfrak p$上的结构，即是说，$\\mathcal E$是描述性的，是一种对$\\mathfrak p$的理解，而非构造性的，一种对$\\mathfrak p$的定义。也就是说，我们所面对的$\\mathcal E$（几乎）是不区分元阶的。请看如下例子：\n   221→\n   222→#### 例子：龙血\n   223→\n   224→>生活在魔法之都的约翰出生于炼金世家，从小他就对各种炼金原料了如指掌：例如说人血和龙血。在他的眼中，人血就是人的血、而龙血就是龙的血。他们都是血，只是从不同的生物身上得道而已。\n   225→\n   226→我们可以说，人、龙、血对于约翰都是同一元阶的，倘若我们将人、龙、血，作为基石，那么显然，人、龙、血都是1元阶对象；而人血和龙血则都是2元阶对象。\n   227→\n   228→>在遥远的北方，有着一座被巨龙统治的小镇。卢克打小就生活在此，在他的印象中，龙是不可战胜，无可损伤的，然而在龙的压迫下，镇民的生活一日不如一日，反抗的低语此起彼伏，但是却没有人胆敢攻击那无可战胜的龙。然而，卢克有一日却忽然意识到——他从未见过龙受过伤……但是龙血应该也是存在的吧？就和人血一样？ （to do：not a good example）\n   229→\n   230→我们可以说，人血、龙对于卢克都是同1元阶的，倘若我们将人血、龙作为基石，那么显然，人血、龙都是1元阶对象；而根据人血和龙而联想到的龙血，则是2元阶对象。\n   231→\n   232→> 在过了许久之后，卢克和镇民们已经成功反抗的龙的统治，用一把黑剑刺入了龙的心脏。在卢克的晚年，龙血对于他而言已经没有什么特别的了。龙血只是龙的血而已，正如人血只是人的血而已，龙和人一样，都只是会受伤的生物罢了。\n   233→\n   234→我们可以说，此时，人、龙、血对于卢克都是同一元阶的，倘若我们将人、龙、血，作为基石，那么显然，人、龙、血都是1元阶对象；而人血和龙血则都是2元阶对象。\n   235→\n   236→----\n   237→\n   238→为什么会产生这种无法区分元阶的情况呢？其原因在于元阶的定义依赖于第一章所介绍的构造方法，$\\mathcal T_n$总是由$\\mathcal T_{n-1}$所*生成*的，给定某种构造，我们才可以定义元阶——或者说，当我们给对象指定元阶时，我们就确定了一组特定的构造方法。但是$\\mathcal E$本身并不是被构造出来的，**$\\mathcal E$是$\\mathfrak p$上的结构**，而不是$\\mathfrak p$是$\\mathcal E$的结果。\n   239→\n   240→我们并不能够直接说*笔*的概念生成了*铅笔*，因为我们可能先知道了铅笔，然后将许多笔抽象，得到了笔的概念，我们也不能够直接说*铅笔*的概念生成了*笔*，因为可能我之前见过许多笔，有了笔的概念，但是却没有见到过铅笔，于是用*笔*的概念想到了一种特别的用石墨做芯的笔（也就是铅笔）。\n   241→\n   242→###  构造（Construction）和形而上学\n   243→\n   244→那么我们为什么要关心元阶呢？因为形而上学：\n   245→\n   246→> 一个$\\mathcal E_m = \\mathcal M$上的构造$\\{\\mathcal T_n^m\\}=\\{\\mathcal T_n\\}^m$(右上角角标$m$用以标记其结果$\\mathcal T_\\infty^m = \\mathcal T^m=\\mathcal M$

其一]]》草稿的整理，删去了一些相关性较弱和未完成的部分。在这一篇文章里，作者用自己的语言大概记录和梳理其高中时期对传统的形而上学的一些看法。许多名词和概念和哲学传统有差别，需要读者注意甄别以免混淆。\n     8→\n     9→\n    10→## 前形而上学\n    11→\n    12→*前形而上学*[^1]，或者我也把它叫做传统形而上学，经典形而上学，是我创造出来的一个名词。所谓前，指的是相对于虚无主义而言的前，即在虚无主义之前的形而上学。\n    13→\n    14→我们将我们在当前所“拥有”的一切叫做*现象*。而在*现象*上，我们推断出一系列*现象*的运行方式/规律。我们似乎认为，所谓“现象的运行方式/规律”，既是前形而上学[^2]。\n    15→\n    16→前形而上学有一个**形式上的**错误理解，既是对“*上*”的理解。形而上学的英文，“*metaphysics*”，字面上来看，既是*元物理*。倘若把物理理解为*现象*，那么形而上学所描述的，既是产生现象的原因。然而事实上，请看上一段对形而上学的解释，形而上学事实上是**自现象而产生的**。所谓“上”，应当是我们**基于现象之上**而有的一套理解，而非自上而下由形而上**生成**了形。因此，*现象*，亦或者说我们所感受到的世界，对于我们而言，并非*生成的世界*，而是对于我们而言的“*第一实在*”[^25]。我们任何的对于现象的理解，都**基于**现象。唯有承认现象既是“*第一实在*”，我们才能够作出任何形而上的推断。\n    17→\n    18→请看如下例子：\n    19→\n    20→> 故失*道*而后*德*，失*德*而后*仁*，失*仁*而后*义*，失*义*而后*礼*。——老子\n    21→\n    22→其中，*道*，*德*，*仁*，*义*，*礼*，自前往后，既是从上至下。*道*生万物，*道*既是最“元始”的*元物理*（*metaphysics*），而有此往后，皆是*生成*的。因此，道既是最上者，是为形而上，而礼既是最下者，是为形。\n    23→\n    24→然而，礼事实上是从现象所总结出来的，我们不妨将这个**切实**的*现象*中的行为称之为“*现象礼*”，我对“*现象礼*”有一个**解释**，既是我对人时发乎于心的对他人感受，这个感受是我个人**切实**感受到的，因而是*现象*的一部分，因此我将其称之为“*现象仁*”。这个感受使得我想要去如何如何地对待他人，这种推动力（motivation）也是我所**切实**感受到的，因此我将其称之为“*现象义*”[^3]。“*现象礼*”不仅仅存在于在我对待他人时，也同样存在于其他人是如何对待他人上，我们便将“*现象仁*”和“*现象义*”作为我们对“*现象礼*”的**解释**推而广之。也就是说，因为“*现象礼*”（似乎）在我们周围的所有人身上都有体现，而我们认为（将“*现象礼*”解释为）“*现象仁*”产生了“*现象义*”又产生了”*现象礼*”，所以我们认为所有（行“现象礼”的）人都（应当）有这种“*现象仁*”[^4]。接下来，我们便把我们认为（应当是）人人皆而有之的东西，在这里便是“*现象仁*”，称之为“*德*”，而为什么会有这种人人皆而有之的**规律**呢？因为“*道*”[^24]。\n    25→\n    26→因此我们看到，在现象的层面上，*仁义*仅仅是对于*礼*的一个解释。对于我们看到的外在的*现象*而言，事实上我们仅仅看到了*现象*中的“*现象礼*”，因而我们**推断**出了“*现象义*”，续而由“*现象义*”**推断**出了“*现象仁*”，即便并**没有**任何**切实**的“*现象义*”和“*现象仁*”出现在我的*现象*中，因为**我**所感受到的发乎于心的感受和推动力仅仅是**我**在行“*现象礼*”时所感受到的，而我无法真正感受到**他人**的内心感受，仅仅是将我对“**自己**的‘*现象礼*’”的解释**套用**到了我们看到的**别人**所行的“*现象礼*”上。因此，别人身上的*仁义*，其实是由*现象*中的“*现象礼*”所生成的。但是我们在解释上却认为是由*仁*而生*义*，因*义*而行*礼*，“*现象礼*”反而是由*仁义*所生成的了。接下来，基于这种生成的*仁义*，我们便总结出来，“人都是有*仁*的”。但是，事实上是“人都是（**可以**）有*仁*的”，因为我们是从诸多有*仁*的人身上发现许多人都是有*仁*的，因此*仁*是我们归纳出来的一个**属性**（**property**）。但是我们最终对其的理解是“人都是（**应该**）有*仁*的”——或者说，“有*仁*的才是人”。因此人可以拥有的一个**属性**，在这里既是“*仁*”，反而变成了人的一个**定义**。而这些**定义**合起来，便定义了**什么是*人***——也就是“*德*”，使得*人*而成为*人*的东西。因此我们看到，事实上“*德*”也是由“*仁*”生成的，但是我们在理解上却认为，是因“*德*”而生“*仁*”：因为你是*人*，所以你要有*仁*。最后，“*德*”是一种一般的规律，因为凡事诸物皆有其*德*（我们认为他应该遵守的规律，使得一样东西成为其本身的东西），因而又将所有的“*德*”合起来，归纳抽象出“*道*”，因此“*道*”实则为“*德*”而生成的，我们却理解为“*道*”生成了“*德*”。\n    27→\n    28→因此，整个逻辑的顺序就被倒反过来。道生德，人德为仁，因仁生义，因义行礼。而这最后的“*礼*”已经不再是一开始的“*现象礼*”，因为从“*现象礼*”生成“*道*”的逻辑已经被**掩埋不见**，已经全部**失**去了，人们以为“*道*”才是最元始的*元物理*。因此最终生成的“*礼*”已然仅仅是一种规范，而不一定是最初的（解释上）发乎于心的而有的*现象礼*了。\n    29→\n    30→在实践中，这种失将继续层层下跌，逐末而忘本。上述并非对《老子》的解释，而是在这一段当中，恰好出现了这种自形而上至形的阶梯，因此将此作为一个例子。\n    31→\n    32→### 形而上\n    33→\n    34→在上述的例子中，我用了中国哲学举例。然而，中国哲学大多是有*形而上*而无*形而上学*的。所谓形而上学，既是研究形而上的学科和学问，是对形而上的学习和分析。在西方，形而上学追求的是*终极实在*，既是最终的，最原始的*元物理*——*根源*之所在。而在中国，大多数时候，我们在一个给定好的*形而上*的框架中抵达这个框架中的*至善*，追求的是*圣人*，因而一是皆以*修身*为*本*。对于*形而上*的探索（也就是*形而上学*）因而相较西方要少了许多。因此，一定要区分*形而上*和*形而上学*的区别。*形而上*是我们对现象的一种**理解**、**解释**。而*形而上学*是对形而上的**研究**。\n    35→\n    36→\n    37→在这里我将形而上分为如下几种：\n    38→\n    39→#### *第〇种*：经验的总结\n    40→\n    41→形而上的核心是***恒常***。我们需要在变化的现象之中寻找到（追求）一种*恒常*性，因此我们才能够有意作出任何有（对于我们而言的）结果的行为。有人将形而上学的基础总结为*同一*，*因果*。然而，*因果*即为时间上的*同一*，因此其本质上是一回事。我在这里将其称之为*恒常*。*恒常*的意义是一种（我们给自己的）“**保证**”。这个**保证**既是：同样的*现象*（*实在*）将会**重复**的出现。\n    42→\n    43→也就是说，我们首先认为，我们眼前的一个苹果（的图像），在下一刻，他和这一刻，是**同一个***东西*——既是*恒常*。\n    44→我们看着这个苹果（的图像）在我们的视野中变化位置，缩放，甚至旋转（旋转改变了他的图像，因而递进），我们却依旧认为这是**同一个***东西*——既是*恒常*。\n    45→\n    46→我们根据我们**眼前的**这个**具体的**[^5]苹果的图像，构建了一个（具体的）“*东西*”，也就是这一个**具体**的（我们认为是）“客观存在的”苹果，这个（具体的）“*东西*”，相对于变化的*现象*，既是*恒常*。\n    47→注意到，这个“*东西*”实则我们对我们**眼前的**苹果图像的**解释**——他是由现象中的苹果图像所*生成*的。我们把这个“*东西*”叫做“*第二实在*”。\n    48→\n    49→我们看到了数个不同的具体的苹果，我们从他们的相似之处中*抽象*出了一个“苹果”的概念。这也是*恒常*。这个“*理想的‘苹果’*”，或者说，这个“*形而上的苹果*”，是我们对具体的苹果的*归纳*（*抽象*）[^6]。\n    50→\n    51→我们把这两种恒常叫做*第〇种形而上*。\n    52→\n    53→#### *第一种*：经验的预测\n    54→\n    55→*第一种形而上*必须要基于*第〇种形而上*。他是基于*第〇种形而上*之上的*恒常*：总是发生的事情（大概率）会（在未来或者空间中）**重复**发生[^7]。\n    56→\n    57→例一：我看到了**很多次**苹果树上结苹果，苹果变大了掉下来。所以我认为苹果树**以后**也会**重复**地结苹果，他结的苹果**以后**也会**重复**地掉下来——是为*恒常*。\n    58→\n    59→例二：李四**每次**用我的东西都会送回来，张三**每次**用我的东西都大多自己拿走了。所以我认为，**以后**李四用我的东西也**都**会送回来，张三**以后**用我的东西也**都**大多自己拿走了——是为*恒常*。\n    60→\n    61→#### *第二种*：经验的抽象\n    62→\n    63→我们将第一种形而上*归纳*，*抽象*为一种概念，例如“*诚信*”——是为*恒常*。\n    64→\n    65→我们注意到，*第〇、一、二种形而上*，都是同样的两步过程：对**重复**事物的认知（这种认知是*恒常*的，因其认知正在于其**重复**）[^8]，然后将这种认知抽象理解，**固定**为一个（*形而上*）*概念*（这个*概念*是*恒常*的，因其已经**脱离***现象*而恒在）[^9]。第一步既是*第一种形而上*，第二步既是*第二种形而上*。\n    66→\n    67→所谓*第〇种*，其实只是*第一种*（步）和*第二种*（步）最简单（trivial）和基础（fundamental）的形式。第〇种更强调的是其原材料**全部**来自于（“原始的”）*现象* [^10]，而*第一二种*中，其原材料除了来自于（“原始的”）*现象*，也来自于已有的*概念*（*形而上*）[^11]。\n    68→\n    69→注意到，这种“*归纳*”，是**合**，也是**分**。他界定了什么是**同一个**东西/概念——于是也界定了哪些**不是同一种**东西/概念。\n    70→\n    71→#### *第三种*：抽象的组合\n    72→\n    73→*第三种形而上*，便是对*第二种形而上*的理解。他**连接**不同的*形而上*，又自*形而上*而产生*形而上*——也就是说，他是对已有*形而上*的一种**形式化**，因此他可能是一种**框架**、一种**价值**。\n    74→\n    75→---- \n    76→\n    77→注意到，我们提到了两种形而上的“理解”。第一种是自下而上的，例如形式为*归纳*的理解：我们看到了高楼林立，因此我们把高楼林立的地方归纳为城市。另一方面，则是自上而下的，形式为*定义*的理解：我们认为城市**应当**是高楼林立的。甚至我们可以通过再其上的形而上（*第三种*），重新定义城市，再要求具体的城市具有哪些功能和特征。这也是自上而下的。有了实践作为桥梁，自下而上将会影响到自上而下，而自上而下也会影响到自下而上。因而最终上述几种形而上会夹杂在一起[^12]。\n    78→\n    79→### 客观世界\n    80→\n    81→*客观世界*是**基于***现象*而提出的一种**模型**。按照本篇中的定义，所谓“*客观世界*”，既是由*第二实在*所构成的“世界”。即是说，我们认识中的*客观世界*，是以*现象*，既*第一实在*，为**基础**，所**生成**的对*现象*其本身的**解释**。在这个解释之中，**形式上**是由*客观世界*生成了被我们所观测到的世界，也就是*现象*。\n    82→\n    83→**形式上**，倘若一开始没有任何东西，那么**先**存在一个**真正的***客观世界*，和**先**存在*现象*，有着巨大的区别（也没有任何区别）。当我们说“**先**存在一个**真正的***客观世界*”时，*现象*是生成的，然后自生成的现象上，生成了**认识中的***客观世界*（而**不**是**真正的***客观世界*）[^13]。当我们说，“**先**存在*现象*”时，就**不**存在**真正的***客观世界*，只存在“**真正的** ”*现象*。我们自*现象*上生成了**认识中的***客观世界*。\n    84→\n    85→然而，我们毫无选择地必然要从*现象***起始**，因此*现象*本身是无可怀疑（因为怀疑*现象*就无任何可立足之**地**，任何*形而上*都自*现象*而来）的存在，所以被称之为“*第一实在*”。而我们进发的方向必然是向着二（上）而无法向着〇（下[^14]）。我们之所以要提出*第〇实在*，是为了给现象以**解释**和**理解**，因而我们提出的正是对*第一实在*的*形而上*，既是*第二实在*。于是对于我们而言，并不存在*第〇实在*，而只存在*第二实在*。当我们提出*第〇实在*时，这个我们所提出的东西就是*第二实在*[^15]。\n    86→\n    87→\n    88→#### 附录：关于本篇中“形而上”一词的一点说明\n    89→\n    90→“形而上学”一词，乃是自英文“metaphysics”翻译而来。其中，“形而上”，取自《易经系辞传》第八章第五节：\n    91→\n    92→> 是故形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器，化而裁之谓之变，推而行之谓之通，举而措之天下之民，谓之事业。\n    93→\n    94→在本片文章中，对将形解为“现象”。现象是一切的基础，因而是最下者。因此这种解释有异于系辞传中“形”的本意。如果要一一对应，还是以苹果为例子，那么系辞传中的形对应于本篇中的“理想中的‘苹果’”，器对应于对应于*第二实在*的苹果。\n    95→\n    96→## 前形而上学的讨论\n    97→\n    98→一般认为，形而上学的末路是*虚无主义*。\n    99→\n   100→在我看来，形而上学的发展有其脉络。其脉络既是对于终极实在的层层回避，步步后退，而向着实用性逐渐靠近的过程。因为愈探求，愈不可探求，因为“事实上并不存在这样的终极实在可以背触及”。随着“最高价值”（既“终极实在”）的丧失，形而上学的大厦自然地倒塌，留下的遗迹被称之为虚无主义。虚无主义不是一种有、一种主义，而是一种无，一种缺位。虚无主义不是被生产、创造出来的，正如虚空并不是被生产创造出来的，而是因为没有生产和创造了，这里什么都没有而已。\n   101→\n   102→但是，注意到，虚无主义中的大部分议题实际上是**非理性**的。\n   103→\n   104→### 非理性\n   105→\n   106→显然的，理性的目的必然要在理性之外[^23]，所以，理性的目的必然是非理性的——也就是说，理性仅仅作为一种工具而存在。\n   107→\n   108→因此我们自然的知道，**对*终极实在*的追求本身就是非理性的**（形而上学本身就是非理性的）。因此，虚无主义之所以能够被提出来（虚无主义之所以是虚无**主义**、之所以使得“没有终极实在”成为一种议题）的原因也是**非理性**的。\n   109→\n   110→而形而上学和虚无主义之所以是非理性的原因，是因为我们对*形而上*的**追求**是非理性的。因为倘若不存在任何的形而上，那么我们面对现象就没有任何“抓手”——我们就无法（对于我们而言）有意义的作出任何行为[^19]。也就是说，我们（看似理性的）对*形而上*的**追求**其实就是我们**非理性**的对*恒常性*的追求。而这种**非理性**是应当被**承认**的[^20]。因为这种非理性所造成的结果既是使得理想和现象重叠，使得我们能够（似乎是主观的）作出任何（有主观意义上的结果的）实践。\n   111→\n   112→这种非理性的由来，在追求恒常性之上，我认为还有一层，即是我们需要这种“实践”。这种理想和现象的重叠，既是“自我实现”（Self Realization，使得自我得以成为现实）——我们在现象中看到我们自身，证实我的存在，使得现象成为“我的一部分”（籍于理想和现象的重叠，我们在现象中重现了我的理想）。\n   113→\n   114→## 后形而上学\n   115→\n   116→后形而上学，必然是虚无主义之后才可以产生的形而上学。以我所见，所谓后形而上学，既是以现象为核心，承认所有形而上皆为现象之上的构造的形而上学。因此，其必须时时刻刻认识到，任何的形而上仅仅是对形的描述和建模——因此其方法论的核心必然要将形而上和现象紧密的联系在一起。因此我所见到的大道既是前述的“理想和现象之重叠”——实践。\n   117→\n   118→*后形而上学*，同*前形而上学*一样，是一种*形式化*的*形而上*（即 *第三种形而上*）。与*前形而上学*的区别在于，后形而上学对“价值”、“意义”、“本质”一类的*第〇实在*进行了祛魅：认识到对这些概念的追求来源于一种*非理性*。这一认知立刻自然导致了如下改变：\n   119→1. *第〇实在*不再具有特殊的位置，因为其特殊位置是由*非理性*给定的（直到我们理性的给定这样一个人造的目的为止，但是此时任何*形而上*都可以被如此给定）。\n   120→2. *现象*现在被放到了特殊的位置[^21]。我们意识到任何的*形而上*仅仅是对*现象|形*的描述和建模。\n   121→\n   122→这些改变使得我们需要重申如下结果：\n   123→1. 再次强调，*后形而上学*是形式化的*形而上*。\n   124→2. 在整个形式化体系中，*非理性*得到了承认。这一承认在认识上有两点：承认其（不可避免的）存在、和承认其效果（如承认人对*形而上*的追求）。这两点都我们作为人进行*形而上*的结果[^22]。\n   125→3. *后形而上学*，作为一种*形而上*，具有一种功能性：理想和现象之重叠——*实践*。这一功能性同时具有*非理性*层面上的目的性。\n   126→\n   127→----\n   128→\n   129→请读者移步至《[[形而上学后的目的：诗意]]》文章继续关于后形而上学的探讨。\n   130→\n   131→\n

Through the \"access argument,\" truth and justification both reduce to belief in practice, making 知识 functionally equivalent to \"what each individual believes to be correct.\" This is more radical than post-Gettier externalism or internalism—it dissolves the knowledge/belief distinction entirely at the practical level. The term oscillates between the colloquial sense (what people call knowledge) and the technical sense (JTB), but the author's analysis shows this distinction collapses in epistemic practice. In the K1 categorical framework, knowledge is formalized as a category $(\\mathcal{E}_K)_t$ where objects are beliefs and morphisms are justification relations (which are themselves beliefs).\n\n---\n\n## 认知\n- **Main translation**: cognition\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"cognitive structure\" (when referring to stable patterns)\n  - \"epistemic framework\" (in formal contexts)\n- **Note**: Used to denote the overall cognitive-epistemic architecture. Relates to foundationalism through the author's identification of \"stable structures\" ($S_E$) under categorical evolution—these may include a priori cognitive structures in some interpretations, but the author carefully avoids claiming they are a priori in a transcendental sense. Instead, stable structures are identified *descriptively* through their invariance under evolution, offering a naturalized alternative to Kantian categories. The term bridges psychology (cognitive science) and epistemology (theory of knowledge).\n\n---\n\n## 信念\n- **Main translation**: belief\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"doxastic state\" (in technical epistemological contexts)\n  - \"conviction\" (when emphasizing strength of commitment)\n- **Note**: Central to the author's dissolution of JTB. Defined as \"a thought of taking something as true,\" inherently subjective and \"intrinsically irrelevant to objective truth.\" The author argues that all justification reduces to belief (belief-about-belief), and truth is never directly accessed—only phenomena, which must be \"digested\" into belief. This makes belief the only epistemically operative category. The Chinese 信念 carries stronger connotations of conviction than the English philosophical sense of \"belief,\" but in the formal K1 framework, objects in $(\\mathcal{E}_K)_t$ are beliefs in the weaker technical sense. Translation must preserve that knowledge is ultimately *just* belief in the author's system.\n\n---\n\n## 真理\n- **Main translation**: truth\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"objective truth\" (when distinguishing from subjective belief)\n  - \"correspondence with reality\" (in realist contexts the author critiques)\n- **Note**: The author's treatment is deflationary and access-focused. \"Truth\" in the JTB formula refers to objective truth, but the author argues this is \"methodologically impossible\" to access—we only access phenomena, never truth directly. The \"truth condition is vacuous\" in practice. This is distinct from denying truth's existence (the author remains agnostic) but argues truth *does not enter into actual epistemic processes*. This resembles pragmatist deflation (truth as what works) but is more radical: truth is simply *inoperative* in knowledge formation. Not anti-realism (no ontological claim), but methodological phenomenalism applied to epistemology.\n\n---\n\n## 辩护 / 证成\n- **Main translation**: justification\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"warrant\" (in contexts emphasizing epistemic entitlement)\n  - \"verification relation\" (证实关系, when used as morphism in categorical framework)\n- **Note**: The author's central thesis is that justification reduces to belief. All justification bases (phenomena, truth, prior justified beliefs) collapse into belief when we ask *how we access them*. Phenomena require \"digestion\" into thought; truth is accessed only through phenomena; prior justified beliefs are belief-about-belief. This creates Agrippa's trilemma: either circular justification (rejected via reductio involving babies having knowledge) or foundation in unjustified belief (accepted). In the K1 framework, 证实关系 are morphisms in $(\\mathcal{E}_K)_t$—the structural relations between beliefs that constitute epistemic architecture. This is neither pure foundationalism (no unjustified justifiers) nor coherentism (no mere coherence suffices), but a dissolution: justification *just is* belief-structure.\n\n---\n\n## 经验\n- **Main translation**: experience\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"experiential content\" (when emphasizing phenomenal character)\n  - \"empirical data\" (in contexts about empirical justification)\n- **Note**: The author uses 经验 to bridge phenomena and cognition. In \"A Thought on Knowledge,\" empirical justification is analyzed: to use experience as a justification base, it must be \"digested\" into belief (the Bob examples). This dissolves the distinction between experience-based and belief-based justification. In the K1 strategy, $\\mathbb{E}_t$ (the total experiential category) includes all experience at time $t$, with a stable structure $S_E$ that may partially constitute a priori cognitive structures. Experience is not raw sense-data (rejected empiricism) but always already structured. Relates to reliabilism: even reliable experiential processes must manifest phenomenally to enter justification, neutralizing externalist moves.\n\n---\n\n## 现象\n- **Main translation**: phenomenon / phenomena (plural)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"appearance\" (emphasizing contrast with reality)\n  - \"what is given in experience\" (phenomenological sense)\n- **Note**: The epistemological *starting point*—\"what we experience or observe.\" The author explicitly states: \"in practice, we do not have direct access to truth; we have direct access to phenomena.\" This is the cornerstone of the \"access argument.\" 现象 functions as epistemological bedrock without ontological commitment (not claiming phenomena are \"more real\"—just methodologically primary). Translated \"phenomena\" (not \"phenomenal experience\") to preserve the phenomenological resonance. In the formal framework, $\\mathfrak{P}$ denotes the totality of phenomena, which are then structured into 境 ($\\mathcal{E}$). All justification bases bottom out in phenomena, which must be converted into belief to function epistemically. This is *practical* phenomenalism: whether or not things exist beyond phenomena, only phenomena can serve as starting points for actual justification.\n\n---\n\n## 感受\n- **Main translation**: feeling / felt experience\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"qualitative experience\" (when emphasizing phenomenal character)\n  - \"affective state\" (when emphasizing emotional dimension)\n  - \"experiential component\" (in formal contexts)\n- **Note**: Used interchangeably with \"体验\" to denote parts of phenomena. The author states: \"any part of P\" is a feeling or experience. This is closer to \"qualia\" in philosophy of mind, but without the ontological baggage. In the categorical framework, feelings/experiences are objects in $\\mathcal{E}$, and associations (联想) between them are morphisms. Epistemologically significant because feelings are the \"material\" from which beliefs and knowledge structures are constructed. When the author discusses introspection, feelings are what can be accessed through categorical structure—we can verify the framework by noting whether specific structural positions evoke specific feelings. This provides an empirical check on the formal epistemology.\n\n---\n\n## 境\n- **Main translation**: Jing (preserve as transliterated technical term)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"structured experiential field\" (when explanation is needed)\n  - \"categorical sphere over phenomena\" (in technical contexts)\n  - \"realm of experience\" (in less formal contexts)\n- **Note**: The collection's central concept. Epistemologically, 境 is the *structured organization of phenomena*—the categorical architecture that makes knowledge possible. Defined as a category $\\mathcal{E}$ whose objects are selected from phenomena ($\\mathfrak{P}$) and whose morphisms are associations (联想, also part of phenomena). Crucially: morphisms are also objects (tower structure), making 境 self-referential. This is the *formal* answer to \"how is knowledge structured?\" Not the content of knowledge, but the *form* of epistemic organization. Different 境 can be constructed over the same phenomena (language-境, mathematics-境, knowledge-境), each revealing different stable structures. The term is untranslatable because its meaning is constituted by the entire theoretical framework—translation would require explaining the framework anyway, so preserve \"Jing\" and explicate.\n\n---\n\n## 联想\n- **Main translation**: association\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"associative connection\" (when emphasizing relational character)\n  - \"conceptual link\" (in knowledge contexts)\n- **Note**: Morphisms in the categorical structure of 境. Epistemologically: the relations between experiential contents that constitute cognitive/epistemic structure. When \"I see a pencil and think of a pen,\" the association is the morphism linking pencil to pen in $\\mathcal{E}$. But association is also an object (a feeling of connection), making the structure tower-like. This formalizes how concepts are related in knowledge structures—not through logical entailment alone, but through experiential associations that can be phenomenologically verified. Associations ground both coherentist webs of belief and foundationalist inference chains (both reduce to associative structure in this framework). Translation must preserve that associations are both structural (morphisms) and experiential (objects).\n\n---\n\n## 构造\n- **Main translation**: construction\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"structuration\" (when emphasizing process)\n  - \"generative procedure\" (in contexts about how higher-order concepts arise)\n- **Note**: Refers to the process by which higher-order metaphysical concepts are generated from lower-order elements through categorical tower-building. Epistemologically significant for understanding how abstract concepts are formed from experience. The author distinguishes two directions: bottom-up (abstraction from particular experiences to general concepts) and top-down (applying general concepts to structure particular experiences). Both are \"constructions\" but with different base points. Relates to genetic epistemology (how knowledge develops) and the distinction between discovery and justification. The author emphasizes: 境 is *not* constructed from phenomena (it's a structure *on* phenomena), but metaphysical concepts *within* 境 are constructed through categorical procedures. Essential for understanding how \"knowledge occurs\" (知识的发生) in the K1 framework.\n\n---\n\n## 恒常\n- **Main translation**: constancy / the constant\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"invariance\" (in mathematical contexts)\n  - \"permanence\" (emphasizing temporal aspect)\n  - \"stability\" (when referring to stable structures)\n- **Note**: The *epistemic demand* for stability that motivates all metaphysics. The author argues: \"The core of metaphysics is *constancy*—we need to find (pursue) a kind of constancy in changing phenomena, so that we can meaningfully act.\" This is the *non-rational* foundation of epistemology: we require constancy (same causes produce same effects, identity over time, reidentifiable objects) to have any epistemic traction on phenomena. Relates to Hume's problem of induction (constancy cannot be rationally justified) but the author *accepts* this non-rational basis rather than trying to solve it. The \"stable structures\" ($S_K$, $S_E$) in categorical evolution are formal expressions of constancy—what remains invariant as experience evolves. This shifts epistemology from seeking rational foundations to *describing* the constancies we inevitably construct.\n\n---\n\n## 第一实在\n- **Main translation**: first reality / primary reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"first actuality\" (emphasizing metaphysical weight)\n  - \"primary given\" (phenomenological contexts)\n  - \"epistemological foundation\" (when emphasizing foundational role)\n- **Note**: Phenomena as the *methodologically* (not ontologically) primary starting point for all knowledge. The author states: \"现象 itself is the unquestionable existence... therefore called 'first reality.'\" This is *not* a claim that phenomena are \"most real\" ontologically, but that they are epistemically unavoidable—\"we have no choice but to necessarily start from phenomena.\" Any postulated \"zeroth reality\" (reality-in-itself generating phenomena) becomes \"second reality\" (constructed interpretation) the moment we theorize it. This dissolves skeptical problems about external world: not by proving the external world exists, but by recognizing phenomena are our only possible starting point, making skepticism pragmatically inert. The \"first\" in \"first reality\" is methodological priority, not ontological rank.\n\n---\n\n## 第二实在\n- **Main translation**: second reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"constructed reality\" (emphasizing interpretive aspect)\n  - \"objective world model\" (when referring to physical object interpretation)\n- **Note**: Our *interpretive constructions* over phenomena—the \"things\" we take phenomena to represent. Example: the image of an apple (phenomenon) is interpreted as representing a stable external object, \"the apple\" (second reality). This is where all metaphysics operates: constructing stable constancies over phenomenal flux. The \"objective world\" is second reality—constructed to explain first reality (phenomena), though we then *reverse* the explanatory direction and think second reality generates first reality. Epistemologically: all knowledge claims are about second reality (since phenomena are not \"claims\" but given), but justified only through first reality (phenomena are the only justification base). This explains why knowledge is always interpretively laden yet empirically constrained.\n\n---\n\n## 第〇实在\n- **Main translation**: zeroth reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"reality-in-itself\" (Kantian contexts)\n  - \"noumenal ground\" (emphasizing inaccessibility)\n- **Note**: A hypothetical \"reality behind phenomena\" that, the author argues, is epistemologically inoperative. Any attempt to theorize zeroth reality converts it into second reality (interpretation). The author states: \"真正的道不可道不可名，无可讨论无法提出\" (true Dao cannot be spoken, cannot be named, cannot be discussed or proposed)—any zeroth reality that is discussed is already second reality. This dissolves the correspondence theory of truth: we cannot check our beliefs against reality-in-itself, only against phenomena. Not ontological anti-realism (the author doesn't deny reality-in-itself exists), but *methodological* phenomenalism: reality-in-itself, even if it exists, cannot enter into epistemology. The numbering is deliberate: we start from 1 (phenomena), construct 2 (interpretations), and can never reach 0 (pre-interpretive reality).\n\n---\n\n## 形而上学\n- **Main translation**: metaphysics\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"meta-physics\" (when emphasizing etymological sense of \"beyond physics\")\n  - \"theory of ultimate reality\" (in traditional contexts the author critiques)\n- **Note**: The author distinguishes \"metaphysics\" (形而上学, the study of metaphysical concepts) from \"the metaphysical\" (形而上, metaphysical concepts themselves). Traditional metaphysics seeks \"ultimate reality\" but the author's \"post-metaphysics\" (后形而上学) recognizes all metaphysics as *constructions over phenomena*, not discoveries of pre-given reality. Epistemologically significant: metaphysical concepts function as universal properties (始对象/终对象) in categorical structures—they are the *stable points* toward which associations converge. For example, the concept \"pen\" is the terminal object in the sub-category of pen-like objects: all specific pens point to \"pen-in-general.\" This explains how abstract concepts function in knowledge: they are organizational nodes, not Platonic forms. Translation must preserve that the author is *not* rejecting metaphysics but reframing it descriptively.\n\n---\n\n## 虚无\n- **Main translation**: nihility / the void\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"nihilism\" (when referring to the philosophical position)\n  - \"absence\" (when emphasizing privative character)\n  - \"meaninglessness\" (in value contexts)\n- **Note**: The consequence of realizing that traditional metaphysics sought a \"zeroth reality\" that cannot be reached. The author states: \"Nihilism is not a something, not an -ism, but a lack, an absence.\" This is not a position to argue for but a *state* resulting from the collapse of metaphysical foundations when \"ultimate reality\" is recognized as inaccessible. Epistemologically: nihilism shows that the *goal* of traditional epistemology (knowledge of ultimate reality) is unattainable, but this doesn't make knowledge impossible—it shifts the question from \"do we have knowledge?\" to \"what do we do with beliefs in the absence of foundations?\" The author's post-metaphysical approach accepts the void and works within it, making practice (not foundation) primary.\n\n---\n\n## 理性\n- **Main translation**: reason / rationality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"rational faculty\" (when emphasizing cognitive capacity)\n  - \"the rational\" (as noun, contrasted with non-rational)\n- **Note**: The author makes a crucial argument: \"the goal of reason must lie outside reason, so the goal of reason is necessarily non-rational—that is, reason exists only as a tool.\" This has epistemological implications: rational justification cannot justify itself without circularity, so rationality's *value* is non-rationally grounded (in the non-rational demand for constancy, for effective action, for meaning). This resolves the regress problem differently than foundationalism or coherentism: the regress ends in non-rational commitment, which is *accepted* rather than disguised. The pursuit of knowledge is ultimately non-rational (we cannot rationally justify why knowledge matters), but this doesn't vitiate knowledge—it locates knowledge within the broader context of human non-rational aims.\n\n---\n\n## 非理性\n- **Main translation**: the non-rational / non-rationality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"arational\" (to avoid negative connotations of \"irrational\")\n  - \"extra-rational\" (emphasizing it's beyond, not against, reason)\n- **Note**: NOT \"irrational\" (against reason) but \"non-rational\" (outside reason's domain). The author identifies several non-rational foundations of epistemology: (1) the demand for constancy/metaphysics, (2) the need for self-realization through practice, (3) the goals that make knowledge valuable. This is the phenomenological/existential dimension of epistemology that analytic philosophy often brackets. The author states these non-rational elements \"should be acknowledged\" because they make rational activity possible and meaningful. Importantly: non-rational ≠ unjustifiable; it's unjustifiable *by reason*, but pragmatically justified by its role in making human life possible. This connects to naturalized epistemology: if we study how humans actually form knowledge, we find non-rational elements throughout.\n\n---\n\n## 先验\n- **Main translation**: a priori\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"transcendental\" (in Kantian contexts)\n  - \"prior to experience\" (when emphasizing temporal/logical priority)\n- **Note**: The author's treatment is carefully agnostic. Stable structures $S_E$ preserved under evolution *might* include a priori elements if we identify them with the earliest structures $S_{E_c}$ at the first moment of cognitive life, \"independent of experience and sense-impressions.\" But the author emphasizes this is *descriptive*, not transcendental deduction. We identify stable structures empirically (by observing invariance), not by transcendental argument. This naturalizes the a priori: instead of \"necessary conditions of possible experience,\" we get \"evolutionarily stable structures in actual experience.\" Relates to Quine's naturalized epistemology (no first philosophy) but retains something like Kantian structure (cognitive frameworks that organize experience). The translation must preserve the author's agnosticism: these *might* be a priori, but we only access them as stable patterns.\n\n---\n\n## 综合\n- **Main translation**: synthesis / synthetic\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"integration\" (emphasizing unification)\n  - \"combination\" (in contexts about concept formation)\n- **Note**: Used in contexts about how elements are combined to form higher-level structures. In epistemology, relates to the synthetic a priori (Kant) and the distinction between analytic and synthetic judgments. The author's framework suggests all knowledge is synthetic (constructed from experiential materials), including what we might call \"analytic\" truths (these are just highly stable constructions). In the categorical framework, synthesis corresponds to functorial mappings that preserve structure while combining or transforming elements. Not heavily theorized in the texts, but implicit in the tower-construction methodology: higher-order concepts synthesize lower-order ones while preserving associative structure.\n\n---\n\n## 分析\n- **Main translation**: analysis / analytic\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"decomposition\" (when emphasizing breaking down)\n  - \"conceptual analysis\" (in philosophical contexts)\n- **Note**: The process of examining concepts by breaking them into components or examining their structure. The author's method is deeply analytic in practice: analyzing JTB into components, analyzing justification bases into access-modes, analyzing metaphysical concepts into categorical structures. But the author likely rejects the analytic/synthetic distinction as traditionally drawn (all judgments are ultimately grounded in synthetic experience). In formal contexts, \"analysis\" might refer to examining categorical structure—identifying objects, morphisms, universal properties. The \"Analysis Report\" itself exemplifies philosophical analysis: systematic examination of how epistemological concepts function in the author's framework.\n\n---\n\n## 掌握\n- **Main translation**: grasp / to grasp / mastery\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"command\" (emphasizing full competence)\n  - \"to have mastered\" (emphasizing achievement)\n  - \"complete understanding\" (when specifically about comprehension)\n- **Note**: Technical term in the K1 strategy's discussion of natural transformations. To \"grasp\" a formula $a$ means the natural transformation component $\\eta_a$ is the identity morphism—the evolution of the formula's structure aligns perfectly with one's experiential evolution, requiring no mediating confirmation process. The author states: \"当 $\\eta_a$ 是单位元时... 不需要经过任何额外思考来完成确认\" (when $\\eta_a$ is the identity... no additional thought is needed for confirmation). This is a *phenomenological* notion of knowledge: you \"grasp\" something when your experience of thinking through it matches your experience of the result directly, without gap. Relates to Bolzano's \"Vorstellung,\" intuitive understanding, and tacit knowledge—but formalized categorically. Not mere familiarity, but structural alignment.\n\n---\n\n## 理解\n- **Main translation**: understanding / to understand\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"comprehension\" (emphasizing grasping meaning)\n  - \"intelligibility\" (as noun, what makes something understandable)\n- **Note**: More general than \"掌握.\" The author states: \"当我看到一个东西，并且认为你懂这个东西，这意味着这个东西的结构演化与你自身的经验演化之间确立了一个自然变换\" (when you see something and think you understand it, this means a natural transformation is established between the thing's structural evolution and your experiential evolution). Understanding is the *feeling* of $\\eta$ (the alignment between structure and experience), even if $\\eta$ is not the identity (not full grasp). You can understand something without fully grasping it—there's a gradient. This dissolves the understanding/explanation distinction: understanding IS the experiential alignment, not a separate mental act. Relates to hermeneutics (understanding as fusion of horizons) but formalized categorically: understanding is natural transformation.\n\n---\n\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":9369,"cache_read_input_tokens":51150,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":9369},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CXzp1QVg3iDYBT1rUQyG7","type":"assistant","uuid":"9f46f81f-5ee5-4722-b7ce-a87a8fd93d09","timestamp":"2026-02-10T17:52:31.127Z"}

Legenravend/49 Workspace/Epistemology/Dictionary.md\" << 'DICTIONARY_EOF'\n# Translation Dictionary for Epistemology Expert\n## Jing-Translation Team\n\nThis dictionary provides epistemologically-grounded translations for key terms in the 境集 collection, with attention to their roles in theories of knowledge, justification, and epistemic structure.\n\n---\n\n## 知识\n- **Main translation**: knowledge\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"belief taken to be correct\" (when emphasizing the author's deflationary analysis)\n  - \"what is believed to be knowledge\" (in contexts emphasizing epistemic relativism)\n- **Note**: The author radically redefines 知识 by collapsing the JTB tripartite analysis. Through the \"access argument,\" truth and justification both reduce to belief in practice, making 知识 functionally equivalent to \"what each individual believes to be correct.\" This is more radical than post-Gettier externalism or internalism—it dissolves the knowledge/belief distinction entirely at the practical level. The term oscillates between the colloquial sense (what people call knowledge) and the technical sense (JTB), but the author's analysis shows this distinction collapses in epistemic practice. In the K1 categorical framework, knowledge is formalized as a category $(\\mathcal{E}_K)_t$ where objects are beliefs and morphisms are justification relations (which are themselves beliefs).\n\n---\n\n## 认知\n- **Main translation**: cognition\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"cognitive structure\" (when referring to stable patterns)\n  - \"epistemic framework\" (in formal contexts)\n- **Note**: Used to denote the overall cognitive-epistemic architecture. Relates to foundationalism through the author's identification of \"stable structures\" ($S_E$) under categorical evolution—these may include a priori cognitive structures in some interpretations, but the author carefully avoids claiming they are a priori in a transcendental sense. Instead, stable structures are identified *descriptively* through their invariance under evolution, offering a naturalized alternative to Kantian categories. The term bridges psychology (cognitive science) and epistemology (theory of knowledge).\n\n---\n\n## 信念\n- **Main translation**: belief\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"doxastic state\" (in technical epistemological contexts)\n  - \"conviction\" (when emphasizing strength of commitment)\n- **Note**: Central to the author's dissolution of JTB. Defined as \"a thought of taking something as true,\" inherently subjective and \"intrinsically irrelevant to objective truth.\" The author argues that all justification reduces to belief (belief-about-belief), and truth is never directly accessed—only phenomena, which must be \"digested\" into belief. This makes belief the only epistemically operative category. The Chinese 信念 carries stronger connotations of conviction than the English philosophical sense of \"belief,\" but in the formal K1 framework, objects in $(\\mathcal{E}_K)_t$ are beliefs in the weaker technical sense. Translation must preserve that knowledge is ultimately *just* belief in the author's system.\n\n---\n\n## 真理\n- **Main translation**: truth\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"objective truth\" (when distinguishing from subjective belief)\n  - \"correspondence with reality\" (in realist contexts the author critiques)\n- **Note**: The author's treatment is deflationary and access-focused. \"Truth\" in the JTB formula refers to objective truth, but the author argues this is \"methodologically impossible\" to access—we only access phenomena, never truth directly. The \"truth condition is vacuous\" in practice. This is distinct from denying truth's existence (the author remains agnostic) but argues truth *does not enter into actual epistemic processes*. This resembles pragmatist deflation (truth as what works) but is more radical: truth is simply *inoperative* in knowledge formation. Not anti-realism (no ontological claim), but methodological phenomenalism applied to epistemology.\n\n---\n\n## 辩护 / 证成\n- **Main translation**: justification\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"warrant\" (in contexts emphasizing epistemic entitlement)\n  - \"verification relation\" (证实关系, when used as morphism in categorical framework)\n- **Note**: The author's central thesis is that justification reduces to belief. All justification bases (phenomena, truth, prior justified beliefs) collapse into belief when we ask *how we access them*. Phenomena require \"digestion\" into thought; truth is accessed only through phenomena; prior justified beliefs are belief-about-belief. This creates Agrippa's trilemma: either circular justification (rejected via reductio involving babies having knowledge) or foundation in unjustified belief (accepted). In the K1 framework, 证实关系 are morphisms in $(\\mathcal{E}_K)_t$—the structural relations between beliefs that constitute epistemic architecture. This is neither pure foundationalism (no unjustified justifiers) nor coherentism (no mere coherence suffices), but a dissolution: justification *just is* belief-structure.\n\n---\n\n## 经验\n- **Main translation**: experience\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"experiential content\" (when emphasizing phenomenal character)\n  - \"empirical data\" (in contexts about empirical justification)\n- **Note**: The author uses 经验 to bridge phenomena and cognition. In \"A Thought on Knowledge,\" empirical justification is analyzed: to use experience as a justification base, it must be \"digested\" into belief (the Bob examples). This dissolves the distinction between experience-based and belief-based justification. In the K1 strategy, $\\mathbb{E}_t$ (the total experiential category) includes all experience at time $t$, with a stable structure $S_E$ that may partially constitute a priori cognitive structures. Experience is not raw sense-data (rejected empiricism) but always already structured. Relates to reliabilism: even reliable experiential processes must manifest phenomenally to enter justification, neutralizing externalist moves.\n\n---\n\n## 现象\n- **Main translation**: phenomenon / phenomena (plural)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"appearance\" (emphasizing contrast with reality)\n  - \"what is given in experience\" (phenomenological sense)\n- **Note**: The epistemological *starting point*—\"what we experience or observe.\" The author explicitly states: \"in practice, we do not have direct access to truth; we have direct access to phenomena.\" This is the cornerstone of the \"access argument.\" 现象 functions as epistemological bedrock without ontological commitment (not claiming phenomena are \"more real\"—just methodologically primary). Translated \"phenomena\" (not \"phenomenal experience\") to preserve the phenomenological resonance. In the formal framework, $\\mathfrak{P}$ denotes the totality of phenomena, which are then structured into 境 ($\\mathcal{E}$). All justification bases bottom out in phenomena, which must be converted into belief to function epistemically. This is *practical* phenomenalism: whether or not things exist beyond phenomena, only phenomena can serve as starting points for actual justification.\n\n---\n\n## 感受\n- **Main translation**: feeling / felt experience\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"qualitative experience\" (when emphasizing phenomenal character)\n  - \"affective state\" (when emphasizing emotional dimension)\n  - \"experiential component\" (in formal contexts)\n- **Note**: Used interchangeably with \"体验\" to denote parts of phenomena. The author states: \"any part of P\" is a feeling or experience. This is closer to \"qualia\" in philosophy of mind, but without the ontological baggage. In the categorical framework, feelings/experiences are objects in $\\mathcal{E}$, and associations (联想) between them are morphisms. Epistemologically significant because feelings are the \"material\" from which beliefs and knowledge structures are constructed. When the author discusses introspection, feelings are what can be accessed through categorical structure—we can verify the framework by noting whether specific structural positions evoke specific feelings. This provides an empirical check on the formal epistemology.\n\n---\n\n## 境\n- **Main translation**: Jing (preserve as transliterated technical term)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"structured experiential field\" (when explanation is needed)\n  - \"categorical sphere over phenomena\" (in technical contexts)\n  - \"realm of experience\" (in less formal contexts)\n- **Note**: The collection's central concept. Epistemologically, 境 is the *structured organization of phenomena*—the categorical architecture that makes knowledge possible. Defined as a category $\\mathcal{E}$ whose objects are selected from phenomena ($\\mathfrak{P}$) and whose morphisms are associations (联想, also part of phenomena). Crucially: morphisms are also objects (tower structure), making 境 self-referential. This is the *formal* answer to \"how is knowledge structured?\" Not the content of knowledge, but the *form* of epistemic organization. Different 境 can be constructed over the same phenomena (language-境, mathematics-境, knowledge-境), each revealing different stable structures. The term is untranslatable because its meaning is constituted by the entire theoretical framework—translation would require explaining the framework anyway, so preserve \"Jing\" and explicate.\n\n---\n\n## 联想\n- **Main translation**: association\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"associative connection\" (when emphasizing relational character)\n  - \"conceptual link\" (in knowledge contexts)\n- **Note**: Morphisms in the categorical structure of 境. Epistemologically: the relations between experiential contents that constitute cognitive/epistemic structure. When \"I see a pencil and think of a pen,\" the association is the morphism linking pencil to pen in $\\mathcal{E}$. But association is also an object (a feeling of connection), making the structure tower-like. This formalizes how concepts are related in knowledge structures—not through logical entailment alone, but through experiential associations that can be phenomenologically verified. Associations ground both coherentist webs of belief and foundationalist inference chains (both reduce to associative structure in this framework). Translation must preserve that associations are both structural (morphisms) and experiential (objects).\n\n---\n\n## 构造\n- **Main translation**: construction\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"structuration\" (when emphasizing process)\n  - \"generative procedure\" (in contexts about how higher-order concepts arise)\n- **Note**: Refers to the process by which higher-order metaphysical concepts are generated from lower-order elements through categorical tower-building. Epistemologically significant for understanding how abstract concepts are formed from experience. The author distinguishes two directions: bottom-up (abstraction from particular experiences to general concepts) and top-down (applying general concepts to structure particular experiences). Both are \"constructions\" but with different base points. Relates to genetic epistemology (how knowledge develops) and the distinction between discovery and justification. The author emphasizes: 境 is *not* constructed from phenomena (it's a structure *on* phenomena), but metaphysical concepts *within* 境 are constructed through categorical procedures. Essential for understanding how \"knowledge occurs\" (知识的发生) in the K1 framework.\n\n---\n\n## 恒常\n- **Main translation**: constancy / the constant\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"invariance\" (in mathematical contexts)\n  - \"permanence\" (emphasizing temporal aspect)\n  - \"stability\" (when referring to stable structures)\n- **Note**: The *epistemic demand* for stability that motivates all metaphysics. The author argues: \"The core of metaphysics is *constancy*—we need to find (pursue) a kind of constancy in changing phenomena, so that we can meaningfully act.\" This is the *non-rational* foundation of epistemology: we require constancy (same causes produce same effects, identity over time, reidentifiable objects) to have any epistemic traction on phenomena. Relates to Hume's problem of induction (constancy cannot be rationally justified) but the author *accepts* this non-rational basis rather than trying to solve it. The \"stable structures\" ($S_K$, $S_E$) in categorical evolution are formal expressions of constancy—what remains invariant as experience evolves. This shifts epistemology from seeking rational foundations to *describing* the constancies we inevitably construct.\n\n---\n\n## 第一实在\n- **Main translation**: first reality / primary reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"first actuality\" (emphasizing metaphysical weight)\n  - \"primary given\" (phenomenological contexts)\n  - \"epistemological foundation\" (when emphasizing foundational role)\n- **Note**: Phenomena as the *methodologically* (not ontologically) primary starting point for all knowledge. The author states: \"现象 itself is the unquestionable existence... therefore called 'first reality.'\" This is *not* a claim that phenomena are \"most real\" ontologically, but that they are epistemically unavoidable—\"we have no choice but to necessarily start from phenomena.\" Any postulated \"zeroth reality\" (reality-in-itself generating phenomena) becomes \"second reality\" (constructed interpretation) the moment we theorize it. This dissolves skeptical problems about external world: not by proving the external world exists, but by recognizing phenomena are our only possible starting point, making skepticism pragmatically inert. The \"first\" in \"first reality\" is methodological priority, not ontological rank.\n\n---\n\n## 第二实在\n- **Main translation**: second reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"constructed reality\" (emphasizing interpretive aspect)\n  - \"objective world model\" (when referring to physical object interpretation)\n- **Note**: Our *interpretive constructions* over phenomena—the \"things\" we take phenomena to represent. Example: the image of an apple (phenomenon) is interpreted as representing a stable external object, \"the apple\" (second reality). This is where all metaphysics operates: constructing stable constancies over phenomenal flux. The \"objective world\" is second reality—constructed to explain first reality (phenomena), though we then *reverse* the explanatory direction and think second reality generates first reality. Epistemologically: all knowledge claims are about second reality (since phenomena are not \"claims\" but given), but justified only through first reality (phenomena are the only justification base). This explains why knowledge is always interpretively laden yet empirically constrained.\n\n---\n\n## 第〇实在\n- **Main translation**: zeroth reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"reality-in-itself\" (Kantian contexts)\n  - \"noumenal ground\" (emphasizing inaccessibility)\n- **Note**: A hypothetical \"reality behind phenomena\" that, the author argues, is epistemologically inoperative. Any attempt to theorize zeroth reality converts it into second reality (interpretation). The author states: \"真正的道不可道不可名，无可讨论无法提出\" (true Dao cannot be spoken, cannot be named, cannot be discussed or proposed)—any zeroth reality that is discussed is already second reality. This dissolves the correspondence theory of truth: we cannot check our beliefs against reality-in-itself, only against phenomena. Not ontological anti-realism (the author doesn't deny reality-in-itself exists), but *methodological* phenomenalism: reality-in-itself, even if it exists, cannot enter into epistemology. The numbering is deliberate: we start from 1 (phenomena), construct 2 (interpretations), and can never reach 0 (pre-interpretive reality).\n\n---\n\n## 形而上学\n- **Main translation**: metaphysics\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"meta-physics\" (when emphasizing etymological sense of \"beyond physics\")\n  - \"theory of ultimate reality\" (in traditional contexts the author critiques)\n- **Note**: The author distinguishes \"metaphysics\" (形而上学, the study of metaphysical concepts) from \"the metaphysical\" (形而上, metaphysical concepts themselves). Traditional metaphysics seeks \"ultimate reality\" but the author's \"post-metaphysics\" (后形而上学) recognizes all metaphysics as *constructions over phenomena*, not discoveries of pre-given reality. Epistemologically significant: metaphysical concepts function as universal properties (始对象/终对象) in categorical structures—they are the *stable points* toward which associations converge. For example, the concept \"pen\" is the terminal object in the sub-category of pen-like objects: all specific pens point to \"pen-in-general.\" This explains how abstract concepts function in knowledge: they are organizational nodes, not Platonic forms. Translation must preserve that the author is *not* rejecting metaphysics but reframing it descriptively.\n\n---\n\n## 虚无\n- **Main translation**: nihility / the void\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"nihilism\" (when referring to the philosophical position)\n  - \"absence\" (when emphasizing privative character)\n  - \"meaninglessness\" (in value contexts)\n- **Note**: The consequence of realizing that traditional metaphysics sought a \"zeroth reality\" that cannot be reached. The author states: \"Nihilism is not a something, not an -ism, but a lack, an absence.\" This is not a position to argue for but a *state* resulting from the collapse of metaphysical foundations when \"ultimate reality\" is recognized as inaccessible. Epistemologically: nihilism shows that the *goal* of traditional epistemology (knowledge of ultimate reality) is unattainable, but this doesn't make knowledge impossible—it shifts the question from \"do we have knowledge?\" to \"what do we do with beliefs in the absence of foundations?\" The author's post-metaphysical approach accepts the void and works within it, making practice (not foundation) primary.\n\n---\n\n## 理性\n- **Main translation**: reason / rationality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"rational faculty\" (when emphasizing cognitive capacity)\n  - \"the rational\" (as noun, contrasted with non-rational)\n- **Note**: The author makes a crucial argument: \"the goal of reason must lie outside reason, so the goal of reason is necessarily non-rational—that is, reason exists only as a tool.\" This has epistemological implications: rational justification cannot justify itself without circularity, so rationality's *value* is non-rationally grounded (in the non-rational demand for constancy, for effective action, for meaning). This resolves the regress problem differently than foundationalism or coherentism: the regress ends in non-rational commitment, which is *accepted* rather than disguised. The pursuit of knowledge is ultimately non-rational (we cannot rationally justify why knowledge matters), but this doesn't vitiate knowledge—it locates knowledge within the broader context of human non-rational aims.\n\n---\n\n## 非理性\n- **Main translation**: the non-rational / non-rationality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"arational\" (to avoid negative connotations of \"irrational\")\n  - \"extra-rational\" (emphasizing it's beyond, not against, reason)\n- **Note**: NOT \"irrational\" (against reason) but \"non-rational\" (outside reason's domain). The author identifies several non-rational foundations of epistemology: (1) the demand for constancy/metaphysics, (2) the need for self-realization through practice, (3) the goals that make knowledge valuable. This is the phenomenological/existential dimension of epistemology that analytic philosophy often brackets. The author states these non-rational elements \"should be acknowledged\" because they make rational activity possible and meaningful. Importantly: non-rational ≠ unjustifiable; it's unjustifiable *by reason*, but pragmatically justified by its role in making human life possible. This connects to naturalized epistemology: if we study how humans actually form knowledge, we find non-rational elements throughout.\n\n---\n\n## 先验\n- **Main translation**: a priori\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"transcendental\" (in Kantian contexts)\n  - \"prior to experience\" (when emphasizing temporal/logical priority)\n- **Note**: The author's treatment is carefully agnostic. Stable structures $S_E$ preserved under evolution *might* include a priori elements if we identify them with the earliest structures $S_{E_c}$ at the first moment of cognitive life, \"independent of experience and sense-impressions.\" But the author emphasizes this is *descriptive*, not transcendental deduction. We identify stable structures empirically (by observing invariance), not by transcendental argument. This naturalizes the a priori: instead of \"necessary conditions of possible experience,\" we get \"evolutionarily stable structures in actual experience.\" Relates to Quine's naturalized epistemology (no first philosophy) but retains something like Kantian structure (cognitive frameworks that organize experience). The translation must preserve the author's agnosticism: these *might* be a priori, but we only access them as stable patterns.\n\n---\n\n## 综合\n- **Main translation**: synthesis / synthetic\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"integration\" (emphasizing unification)\n  - \"combination\" (in contexts about concept formation)\n- **Note**: Used in contexts about how elements are combined to form higher-level structures. In epistemology, relates to the synthetic a priori (Kant) and the distinction between analytic and synthetic judgments. The author's framework suggests all knowledge is synthetic (constructed from experiential materials), including what we might call \"analytic\" truths (these are just highly stable constructions). In the categorical framework, synthesis corresponds to functorial mappings that preserve structure while combining or transforming elements. Not heavily theorized in the texts, but implicit in the tower-construction methodology: higher-order concepts synthesize lower-order ones while preserving associative structure.\n\n---\n\n## 分析\n- **Main translation**: analysis / analytic\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"decomposition\" (when emphasizing breaking down)\n  - \"conceptual analysis\" (in philosophical contexts)\n- **Note**: The process of examining concepts by breaking them into components or examining their structure. The author's method is deeply analytic in practice: analyzing JTB into components, analyzing justification bases into access-modes, analyzing metaphysical concepts into categorical structures. But the author likely rejects the analytic/synthetic distinction as traditionally drawn (all judgments are ultimately grounded in synthetic experience). In formal contexts, \"analysis\" might refer to examining categorical structure—identifying objects, morphisms, universal properties. The \"Analysis Report\" itself exemplifies philosophical analysis: systematic examination of how epistemological concepts function in the author's framework.\n\n---\n\n## 掌握\n- **Main translation**: grasp / to grasp / mastery\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"command\" (emphasizing full competence)\n  - \"to have mastered\" (emphasizing achievement)\n  - \"complete understanding\" (when specifically about comprehension)\n- **Note**: Technical term in the K1 strategy's discussion of natural transformations. To \"grasp\" a formula $a$ means the natural transformation component $\\eta_a$ is the identity morphism—the evolution of the formula's structure aligns perfectly with one's experiential evolution, requiring no mediating confirmation process.

This is a *phenomenological* notion of knowledge: you \"grasp\" something when your experience of thinking through it matches your experience of the result directly, without gap. Relates to Bolzano's \"Vorstellung,\" intuitive understanding, and tacit knowledge—but formalized categorically. Not mere familiarity, but structural alignment.\n\n---\n\n## 理解\n- **Main translation**: understanding / to understand\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"comprehension\" (emphasizing grasping meaning)\n  - \"intelligibility\" (as noun, what makes something understandable)\n- **Note**: More general than \"掌握.\" The author states: \"当我看到一个东西，并且认为你懂这个东西，这意味着这个东西的结构演化与你自身的经验演化之间确立了一个自然变换\" (when you see something and think you understand it, this means a natural transformation is established between the thing's structural evolution and your experiential evolution).

This dissolves the understanding/explanation distinction: understanding IS the experiential alignment, not a separate mental act. Relates to hermeneutics (understanding as fusion of horizons) but formalized categorically: understanding is natural transformation.\n\n---\n\nDICTIONARY_EOF\n","description":"Create translation dictionary file"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":5900,"cache_read_input_tokens":60519,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":5900},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CXzpCPbAD6TEMYF2rfH9t","type":"assistant","uuid":"f26236b8-6b6a-468b-a4df-fed1bb3be7c9","timestamp":"2026-02-10T17:54:55.373Z"}

The dictionary follows the exact format you requested, with each entry containing:\n\n## Structure for Each Term:\n- **Main translation**: Primary English rendering\n- **Alternatives**: Context-specific translations with usage guidance  \n- **Note**: Detailed epistemological considerations relating to JTB, Gettier problems, foundationalism, coherentism, reliabilism, and the author's unique categorical framework\n\n## Terms Covered:\n\n**Core Epistemological Terms:**\n1. **知识** (knowledge) - Dissolution of JTB; reduction to belief\n2. **信念** (belief) - The only epistemically operative category\n3. **真理** (truth) - Methodologically inaccessible; vacuous in practice\n4. **辩护/证成** (justification) - Reduces to belief-about-belief structure\n5. **认知** (cognition) - Cognitive-epistemic architecture; stable structures\n6. **经验** (experience) - Bridge between phenomena and cognition\n7. **现象** (phenomena) - Epistemological starting point; first reality\n\n**Framework-Specific Terms:**\n8. **境** (Jing) - Categorical structure over phenomena; untranslatable core concept\n9. **感受** (feeling/felt experience) - Objects in the categorical structure\n10. **联想** (association) - Morphisms connecting experiential contents\n11. **构造** (construction) - Tower-building methodology for concepts\n\n**Metaphysical-Epistemological Terms:**\n12. **恒常** (constancy) - Non-rational epistemic demand for stability\n13. **第一实在** (first reality) - Methodological primacy of phenomena\n14. **第二实在** (second reality) - Interpretive constructions over phenomena\n15. **第〇实在** (zeroth reality) - Epistemologically inoperative noumenal ground\n16. **形而上学** (metaphysics) - Post-metaphysical reframing as descriptive\n17. **虚无** (nihility) - State of foundational collapse\n\n**Rationality Terms:**\n18. **理性** (reason/rationality) - Tool whose value is non-rationally grounded\n19. **非理性** (non-rational) - Acknowledged foundations of epistemology\n20. **先验** (a priori) - Naturalized as evolutionarily stable structures\n\n**Analytic Terms:**\n21. **综合** (synthesis) - All knowledge is synthetic construction\n22. **分析** (analysis) - Examining categorical structure\n23. **掌握** (grasp/mastery) - Identity natural transformation; perfect alignment\n24. **理解** (understanding) - Natural transformation; structural-experiential alignment\n\n## Key Epistemological Findings:\n\n**The Access Argument**: The cornerstone move—asking not \"what are justification bases?\" but \"how do we access them?\" All bases (truth, phenomena, prior beliefs) collapse into belief when we examine accessibility.\n\n**Dissolution of JTB**: More radical than post-Gettier repairs—the truth condition is methodologically impossible (we only access phenomena), and justification reduces to belief, making knowledge = belief in practice.\n\n**Categorical Formalization**: Knowledge as category $(\\mathcal{E}_K)_t$ with beliefs as objects, justification relations as morphisms. Knowledge \"occurs\" through categorical evolution preserving stable structures $S_K$.\n\n**Natural Transformations as Understanding**: Understanding formalized as alignment between structural evolution and experiential evolution via natural transformation $\\eta$. \"Grasping\" is when $\\eta$ is identity (perfect alignment).\n\n**Non-Rational Foundations**: The demand for constancy/metaphysics is non-rational but acknowledged—this resolves the regress problem by accepting non-rational commitment rather than seeking rational foundation.\n\nThe dictionary is ready for use by the translation team. Each entry provides both practical translation guidance and deep epistemological context rooted in the analysis report and source materials."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":5912,"cache_read_input_tokens":66419,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":5912},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CXzpP2hrU8W3BMSUSuEkn","type":"assistant","uuid":"186ed027-2747-4e5e-a7b3-4cacbf1673be","timestamp":"2026-02-10T17:55:18.475Z"}
