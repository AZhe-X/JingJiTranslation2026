The staged delivery (general first, targeted after) and the non-leading language in the Critical Experiential Checks are exactly right. The \"What happened to your experience?\" framing is the correct way to probe without priming. No major structural changes needed.\n\n### On Essay-Specific Questions\n\n**My position: NO essay-specific questions alongside the general per-essay questions.** Here is my reasoning:\n\nThe general template (\"What was it about? Did something click? Did anything confuse you? Did it ask you to experience something?\") is already sufficient and — crucially — does not prime the reader for what is coming in the next essay. If after Essay 1 we ask \"Did the comparison between individual cells and society change how you think about collective interest?\" we have just told the reader that Essay 2 might also use analogies between scales, or that we care about analogical reasoning, or that \"changing how you think\" is what these essays are supposed to do. Each essay-specific question leaks information about what we consider important, and that information contaminates the reading of subsequent essays.\n\nThe Critical Experiential Checks at the end already serve the essay-specific function — they probe the key moments (Essay 3's three examples, Essay 4's reversal, Essay 7's meme contrast) but only AFTER the reader has completed everything and submitted their unprompted reports. This is the right place for specificity. Adding it earlier would undermine the very thing we extracted this file to protect.\n\n**One exception I would consider:** After the FINAL essay and Appendix are complete, but BEFORE the Final Prompts, we could ask one essay-specific question per essay as a \"memory check\" — not to probe experience but to verify engagement: \"Can you briefly recall what Essay 3 was about?\" This would confirm the reader actually read and retained each essay before we ask the synthesizing questions. But even this is optional — the general per-essay reports already serve this function if the reader is honest.\n\n### Specific Suggestions\n\n**1. After the Preface — add one question:**\n\nCurrent questions are good. I would add:\n- \"Based on the Preface, what are you expecting the essays to be like?\"\n\nThis captures the reader's expectations before they are either confirmed or disrupted. It gives us data on whether the Preface is setting the right expectations — and the contrast between their pre-reading expectations and their post-reading experience is itself valuable information.\n\n**2. After Each Essay — minor refinement:**\n\nThe question \"Was there anything that confused you? Was it 'I don't understand yet' or 'this is badly written'?\" is excellent — the distinction between productive and unproductive confusion is exactly what we need. No change.\n\nI would slightly refine \"Did you want to keep reading? Where did your attention flag?\" to:\n- \"Did you want to keep reading? If your attention flagged at any point, can you describe where and what was happening in the essay at that moment?\"\n\nThe \"what was happening\" addition helps us locate whether the drop-off is at a specific argumentative move, a passage of mathematical notation, a cultural reference, etc.\n\n**3. Critical Experiential Checks — add one for Essay 5:**\n\nCurrently we probe Essays 3, 4, and 7. Essay 5 (Poetics/诗意) contains the central concept of the entire collection — the lucid/intoxicated dreamscape distinction. I would add:\n\n- Essay 5: \"The author distinguishes two ways of being in a dreamscape. What did you make of this distinction?\"\n\nThis is non-leading: it does not name \"lucid\" or \"intoxicated,\" does not suggest which is better, and does not reveal the connection to the poetic. It simply asks the reader to report what they took from the distinction. If the lucid dreamscape concept landed, they will describe it in their own words. If it did not, we will know.\n\n**4. Critical Experiential Checks — consider adding one for Essay 1:**\n\nEssay 1's \"renormalization\" argument (individual interest → collective interest as macro-level emergent phenomenon) is the quietest philosophical experiment in the collection but sets up the entire framework's approach to emergence and construction. A probe:\n\n- Essay 1: \"After reading this essay, how do you think about the relationship between individuals and groups?\"\n\nNon-leading, open-ended, tests whether the emergence/renormalization insight landed.\n\n**5. The \"tell a friend\" sequence (Final Prompts) is perfect.** The three-prompt sequence — \"about,\" \"like to read,\" \"recommend?\" — captures content, experience, and value in that order. Do not change.\n\n### Summary\n\n- Keep the general per-essay template as-is (no essay-specific additions at that stage)\n- Add \"what are you expecting?\" after the Preface\n- Add attention-flagging detail to the per-essay template\n- Add Essay 5 (dreamscape distinction) and consider Essay 1 (individual/collective) to Critical Experiential Checks\n- Everything else is solid","summary":"Protocol feedback: no essay-specific Qs mid-reading; add Essay 5 + Essay 1 checks at end"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1140,"cache_read_input_tokens":153460,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":1140},"output_tokens":19,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY1zL2gx5fEMfZ4WsbNSm","type":"assistant","uuid":"fe7e9b1f-5e11-4c7e-9409-33486928067a","timestamp":"2026-02-11T08:46:33.770Z"}
