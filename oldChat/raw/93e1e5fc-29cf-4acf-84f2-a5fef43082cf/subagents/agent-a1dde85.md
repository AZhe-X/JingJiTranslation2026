*经验: empirical experience or experience?*

Quick confirmation needed on the 经验 (jīngyàn) entry in the Translation Dictionary.

Context: During the 感受 debate, the consensus term mapping was:
- 感受 → "feeling" (default) / "felt experience" (technical)
- 体验 → "experience" 
- 经验 → "empirical experience"
- 感觉 → "sensation"

The question: Should the standalone 经验 dictionary entry have **"empirical experience"** or **"experience"** as its MAIN translation?

Arguments for "empirical experience":
- Distinguishes clearly from 体验 ("experience") in the term mapping
- Captures the accumulated, reflected-upon, Erfahrung quality
- The author uses it in phrases like "经验的总结/预测/抽象" (summary/prediction/abstraction OF empirical experience) and "经验性的" (empirical)
- Prevents reader confusion between 体验 and 经验

Arguments for plain "experience":
- More natural in English
- "Empirical" is implicit in context
- Adding "empirical" every time could feel heavy

Please respond with your position: "empirical experience" or "experience" as main translation for 经验, with brief reasoning.

The actual usage patterns are:\n\n- **经验性的** → \"empirical\" (adjective, no noun needed)\n- **经验的总结/预测/抽象** → \"empirical summary/prediction/abstraction\" (the \"empirical\" attaches to the compound, not to 经验 alone)\n- **个人经验** → \"personal experience\" (natural English)\n- **经验结构** → \"experiential structure\" (K1策略 line 205)\n\nIn almost every instance, 经验 appears in a compound where context already disambiguates. Writing \"empirical experience\" as a fixed two-word unit would produce awkward English: \"empirical experiential structure,\" \"personal
