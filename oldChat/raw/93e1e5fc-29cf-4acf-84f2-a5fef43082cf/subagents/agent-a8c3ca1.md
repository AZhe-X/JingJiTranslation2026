*Final confirm: feeling default, felt experience for scope*

**FINAL CONFIRMATION — 感受 and related terms**

The author proposes the following resolution:

1. **感受 → "feeling"** as default rendering
2. **感受 → "felt experience"** when broader phenomenological scope needs emphasis (e.g., formal/categorical passages where 感受 = any part of P)
3. **体验 → "experience"** (processual, durational, immersive)
4. **经验 → "empirical experience" / "experience"** (epistemological, accumulated — NEVER confused with 感受)
5. **感觉 → "sensation"** (raw input, Sense 1 per author's fn2)
6. **First-occurrence TN** explaining the author's two-sense definition (诗意 fn2) and the equation P = "the totality of all feelings"

This combines the majority recommendation ("feeling") with the minority's concern about scope (allowing "felt experience" when needed).

Reply to team-lead: **CONFIRM** or **OBJECTION** (with specifics).

The reader who encounters \"feeling\" in the 道德仁义礼 passage and then \"felt experience\" in the categorical passages will register the shift in scope without needing to re-read a TN.

**CONFIRM** on all six points. I accept "felt experience" as a scope marker for categorical/formal passages, even though I still find it slightly awkward — it does useful disambiguating work in context. The first-occurrence TN explaining the author's two-sense definition is essential to make the whole system legible.
