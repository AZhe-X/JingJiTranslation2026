Does it balance accessibility with fidelity to the source? Any concerns about cluttering the text, or about how to handle terms that appear in both 文言 quotations and the author's own modern Chinese? Keep your response concise.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"3b9194df-bd44-434b-ab5a-84e799ba2b03","timestamp":"2026-02-11T00:02:55.879Z"}
