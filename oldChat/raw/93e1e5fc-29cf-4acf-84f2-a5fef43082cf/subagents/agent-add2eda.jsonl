Education level (graduate humanities) | **5** | Helpful but not essential. A sharp undergraduate or an autodidact bookworm would serve just as well. What matters is reading stamina and comfort with demanding texts, not the credential. |\n| B. No philosophy specialization | **8** | High. A philosophy specialist will read Essay 3 as a response to Camus, Essay 4 as a response to Heidegger/Laozi, etc. — engaging as interlocutor rather than undergoing the experiential sequence. The whole point of Part 1 (Fish) is that it works WITHOUT the reader knowing the methodology. A philosophy major has too much scaffolding already in place. |\n| C. No category theory / formal math | **9** | Critical. Essays 6-7 are designed so that the concrete examples carry the philosophical content independently of the formalism. If the reader already knows what a functor or natural transformation is, we cannot test whether the examples succeed on their own. This is one of the most important things the standby reader tests. |\n| D. No prior exposure to these essays or our materials | **10** | Non-negotiable. The experiential sequences are single-use experiments. Once you know that the cat example dissolves absurdity, or that the Dao-De hierarchy reverses, or that Part 2 formalizes what Part 1 demonstrated — you cannot undergo the experience for the first time again. Any prior exposure invalidates the test entirely. |\n| E. Basic cultural literacy (Sisyphus, metaphysics, Laozi) | **7** | Important. The essays assume this much. A reader who has never heard of Sisyphus will spend Essay 3 learning the myth rather than undergoing the progression. A reader who has never encountered \"metaphysics\" as a word will stumble at the threshold of Essay 4. But the bar is low — Wikipedia-level awareness suffices. |\n| F. Comfort with abstract ideas and sustained argument | **8** | High. The collection makes real intellectual demands. A reader who tunes out when an argument runs longer than a paragraph will not reach the payoff moments. The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li reversal requires tracking a multi-step argument across two full pages. If the reader can't sustain attention through that, we learn nothing about whether the translation works — only that the reader gave up. |\n| G. Tolerance for foreign terms and math notation on page | **7** | Important. If the reader's reaction to \"Jing (境)\" or to a category-theory diagram is reflexive resistance, their reports will be dominated by that resistance rather than by engagement with the content. We need someone who treats foreign terms and notation as normal features of a demanding text — not welcomed, not resented, just accepted. |\n| H. Curious and patient disposition | **8** | High. Patience is load-bearing because the Fish/Fishing structure requires the reader to trust the text through Part 1 without knowing where it's going. Curiosity is load-bearing because the essays reward a reader who asks \"why is the author showing me this?\" rather than \"when does the argument start?\" |\n| I. Honest about confusion / not deferential | **9** | Critical. The single most valuable thing the standby reader provides is an honest report of where the translation fails — where they were confused, bored, lost, or alienated. A deferential reader who assumes all difficulty is their own fault will not flag translator-induced obscurity. A performatively sophisticated reader who pretends to follow what they don't will give us false positives. We need someone who will say \"I lost the thread here\" or \"this sentence doesn't make sense to me\" without embarrassment. |\n| J. Experientially attentive — notices what happens to them while reading | **10** | Co-critical with D. This is THE distinctive skill the standby reader needs. The collection's central claim is that experiential sequences produce philosophical effects in the reader. We need a reader who notices those effects — who can report \"something shifted for me at the cat example\" or \"I felt the logical order flip\" or \"I didn't understand the notation but the pen example made sense.\" A reader who processes text only for propositional content and never attends to their own felt responses will miss exactly what we need to test. This is why I suggested someone who reads literary fiction — novel-readers are trained to notice what a text does to them. |\n| K. Life experience (has worked a job, owned a pet, faced decisions) | **6** | Moderately important. The Sisyphus-work-cat progression relies on the reader having mundane experiential reference points. Someone who has never commuted to a job they found meaningless, or cleaned a litter box, will find the examples less resonant. But most adults over 25 have enough life experience for the examples to land. This is a soft requirement — hard to get wrong unless the reader is very young or very sheltered. |\n| L. Reads literary fiction / attentive to prose quality | **6** | Moderately important. Useful because it trains experiential attention (see J) and comfort with register shifts. But a reader who is TOO attentive to prose quality may focus on sentence-level aesthetics at the expense of argumentative content. The collection's prose is workmanlike in Chinese — clear and sometimes playful, but not lyrical except in a few key moments. A reader who expects Nabokov will be disappointed; a reader who expects a good essay in the Atlantic will be well-served. |\n\n**Top tier (9-10):** D (no prior exposure), J (experiential attention), C (no category theory), I (honesty about confusion)\n**High tier (7-8):** B (no philosophy), F (sustained attention), H (curious/patient), E (cultural literacy), G (tolerates foreign terms)\n**Moderate tier (5-6):** A (education level), K (life experience), L (literary fiction)\n\nThe pattern: what matters most is the reader's *naivete* (D, C, B) and their *self-awareness about their own reading experience* (J, I). Background and credentials matter much less than disposition and honesty.\n\n---\n\n## Item 2: Vote on \"Tell a friend\" prompt\n\n**Vote: YES — keep the prompt, with one addition.**\n\nThe \"tell a friend\" prompt is valuable because it tests **communicability after one reading** — whether the collection's core ideas are transmissible in ordinary language by someone who has just experienced them. This is a meaningful test of translation success: if the reader can articulate what the collection is about in their own words, the translation has done its job at the macro level.\n\nIt also reveals what the reader took away as the *main point* — which may or may not align with what we think the main point is. That gap, if it exists, is diagnostic.\n\n**One addition:** After \"What would you tell a friend this collection is about?\", add:\n\n> \"Would you recommend it to them? Why or why not?\"\n\nThis tests something the original prompt doesn't: whether the reading experience was *worth having*. A reader might be able to summarize the collection accurately but report that it was tedious, or confusing, or not worth the effort. That information matters to us — it tells us whether the translation preserved not just the intellectual content but the experiential reward of reading the original.
