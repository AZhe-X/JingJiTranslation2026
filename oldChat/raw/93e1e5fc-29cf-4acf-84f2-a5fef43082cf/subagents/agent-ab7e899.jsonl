This is one of the collection's most radical departures from the Kantian tradition and deserves explicit mention in the Afterword. It also connects naturally to the nihilism-as-consequence claim in Section A, since the dispensability of Zeroth Reality is precisely what enables the author to treat nihilism as a transitional moment rather than a permanent condition.\n\nSuggested addition to the Kantian bullet in Section B: \"The dispensability of Zeroth Reality (第〇实在) — unlike Kant's thing-in-itself, which remains a necessary limiting concept, the author's Zeroth Reality loses its special position entirely through disenchantment (祛魅), enabling the post-metaphysical turn.\"\n\nEverything else — all three Preface edits, the Afterword structure, the placement, the tone, the length range, the process — I fully endorse.
