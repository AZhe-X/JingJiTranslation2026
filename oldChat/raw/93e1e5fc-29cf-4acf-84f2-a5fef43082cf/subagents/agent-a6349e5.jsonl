I had already broadcast the unified proposal before receiving yours. I want to flag the key divergence for your formal response:\n\n**Line 50 — nihilism-as-consequence sentence:** The unified proposal removes the entire structural claims paragraph and replaces it with topic-only text. You want to KEEP the first sentence (\"the author treats nihilism not as the negation of metaphysics but as its consequence...practicing it lucidly\"). Do you want to formally AMEND the proposal on this point?\n\nThe other divergences (the explicit withholding language for Essay 3, the shorter Afterword length, the closing gesture) are tonal variations I can incorporate without structural conflict.\n\nYour suggestion about the Afterword's closing — returning the reader to their own experience rather than ending on scholarly commentary — is excellent and I will incorporate it.\n\nPlease respond with AGREE (accepting the unified proposal as-is) or AMEND (with your specific requested change on line 50).\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"c0375fca-3afd-42e4-b57f-b3ca01a98833","timestamp":"2026-02-11T07:44:33.691Z"}
