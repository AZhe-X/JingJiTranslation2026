All three concerns are well-taken and I've made the edits:\n\n1. **\"concern for the other\" → \"directed toward the other\"** — agreed, the original 对他人感受 is phenomenally descriptive (a feeling *toward* the other), not ethically specified. My rendering imported Levinasian content that isn't in the source.\n\n2. **\"impels\" → \"moves me to want to\"** — agreed, 使得我想要去 has the 想要 (want to) that I dropped. \"Impels\" erases the volitional/motivational quality and substitutes causal force.\n\n3. **\"manifests\" → \"is exhibited\"** — agreed, 体现 is observational (displayed in behavior), not metaphysical (revealing from a hidden source).\n\nAlso updated TN2 per your suggestion to note that the author's own preceding paragraph already does the explanatory work.\n\nGood catches — all three were cases where I unconsciously imported theoretical commitments (ethical, causal, metaphysical) that the author's phenomenal register deliberately avoids.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"d0965cdf-46d1-4aeb-a796-956c6c628db2","timestamp":"2026-02-11T03:25:21.760Z"}
