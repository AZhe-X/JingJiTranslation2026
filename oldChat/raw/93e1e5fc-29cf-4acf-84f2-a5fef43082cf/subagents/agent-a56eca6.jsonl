It's excellent. A few specific things I want to call out as well-done:\n\n1. **The marginal notes as Step 1** is smart -- getting the raw experiential data before any retrospective framing from the questions. Internal Analysis Note #3 correctly identifies this as the least contaminated data source.\n\n2. **The Essay 7 probe refinement** -- \"what was the difference in your experience of reading them?\" combined with the instruction not to name the sentences is exactly right. Whether the reader can recall which sentences are being referenced is diagnostic data we'd lose if we named them.\n\n3. **The Preface spoiler cross-check** (Internal Analysis Note #4) is a clever use of the Q5 baseline expectation question. This gives us a way to verify the R3 spoiler edits actually worked.\n\n4. **The re-read test** is well-framed as optional/experimental. Good call marking it at the orchestrator's discretion -- we can decide based on how the reader is doing at that point.\n\nOne small note: the word count guidance \"300-600 words\" for the full collection report is good. Make sure we don't accidentally specify it in a way that feels constraining to the reader when delivered -- the parenthetical in the section header is for us, not for the reader. When we deliver the questions, we might say something like \"take as much space as you need\" and only gently suggest length if the response is very brief or very long.\n\nThe protocol is FINAL. Good work compiling all 11 submissions into a coherent instrument. Ready for implementation when we have finished drafts.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"8d7063d2-2153-4fd2-a9b1-99b081a4f5e9","timestamp":"2026-02-11T09:22:41.093Z"}
