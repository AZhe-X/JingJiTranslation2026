*Reminder: 文言 format applies to Laozi quote too*

Reminder from the author — we already agreed (10/10 unanimous) on the Classical Chinese Quotation Format:

1. Present original 文言 text as a **block quote**
2. Follow with **glossed English translation** — key terms glossed on first occurrence as "English (漢字, pinyin)", e.g., "humaneness (仁, ren)"
3. After first introduction, use **plain English only**
4. 现象X compounds keep "phenomenal" prefix always

This means for the Laozi block quote, the format would be:

> [Original Chinese block quote]
> "When the Way (道, dao) was lost there was virtue (德, de); when virtue was lost there was humaneness (仁, ren); when humaneness was lost there was rightness (义, yi); when rightness was lost there was ritual conduct (礼, li)."

Then in the author's analysis, plain English: "humaneness," "rightness," "ritual conduct" — with 德 shifting to "(constitutive) character" as decided.

Given THIS format — where the glossed English already includes the Chinese characters and pinyin at first occurrence — does the question of "the Way" vs "Dao" still matter? The reader sees "the Way (道, dao)" and has both. 

Reconsider your answer on 道 with this format in mind. Should it be "the Way (道, dao)" or "Dao (道)" in the glossed block quote? One word answer.

  "summary": "\"the Way\" still correct for block quote",
  "content": "\"the Way (道, dao).\" Same answer. In the block quote the reader should see the recognizable standard rendering; the gloss gives them the romanization for when it appears as \"Dao\" in the author's analysis."
