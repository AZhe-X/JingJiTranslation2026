Now let me read all the essays I need. I already have Essay 4 draft and 关于诗意和境的一些零散想法 from the context. Let me read the remaining essays and the index.

## Claude at 2026-02-11 04:58:15

I see the index lists "后形而上学 其一" and "范畴论与境" but the team lead's list says "后形而上学 整理" and "范畴论与境 整理". Let me check if both exist and which are the correct ones. Also, the index doesn't list "A Thought on Knowledge" separately - let me verify. Actually, the index DOES list "A Thought on Knowledge" at item 2. Let me now read all the essays.

## Claude at 2026-02-11 04:59:13

Let me check the Memo file since it's the largest file in the workspace and likely contains the analysis report or translation dictionary.

[tool: Read]

## Claude at 2026-02-11 04:59:24

I now have all the materials loaded. Let me also check the 后形而上学 其一 since it's listed in the 境集 index (different from 后形而上学 整理).

[tool: Read]
{
  "file_path": "/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录/后形而上学 其一.md",
  "limit": 20
}

---

## Claude at 2026-02-11 04:59:33

I see -- the 境集 index references 后形而上学 其一 but the team lead's list says 后形而上学 整理 (which is the compiled/cleaned version). The 整理 version explicitly says it's a cleanup of 其一. Similarly for 范畴论与境 整理 vs 范畴论与境. The team lead's list uses the 整理 versions which makes sense for translation.

Now I have everything. Let me confirm to the team lead.
