The author is right to worry. Let me be direct.\n\n**1. How misleading is \"virtue\" in this context?**\n\nModerately to seriously misleading -- more than I initially acknowledged. Here is why:\n\nThe English word \"virtue\" in 2026 overwhelmingly triggers *moral* associations for the average educated reader. \"Virtue ethics,\" \"virtuous person,\" \"virtue signaling\" -- the word is saturated with moral content. Even readers who know that \"virtue\" historically meant \"power\" or \"excellence\" (Latin *virtus*) will default to the moral reading unless actively corrected.\n\nIn a Confucian-only text, this is fine -- Confucian 德 IS substantially about moral cultivation, so the moral connotation of \"virtue\" is a feature. In a Daoist-only text, translators can flag the shift early and trust the reader to adjust.\n\nBut in 境集, where the author uses 德 in a **constructivist** sense that is *neither* purely moral (Confucian) *nor* purely naturalistic (Daoist), \"virtue\" will actively pull the reader toward a moral interpretation that the author does not intend. Every time the reader encounters \"virtue,\" they will be fighting against their default English-language understanding. The glossary can correct this *in principle*, but in practice, readers do not consult the glossary every time they see a familiar English word. They read \"virtue\" and think \"moral goodness\" -- the glossary entry corrects this once; the misleading connotation reasserts itself on every subsequent encounter.\n\nThis is the key problem: **a TN corrects a one-time confusion, but \"virtue\" creates a recurring misleading pull throughout the entire text.**\n\n**2.

Forces the reader to learn the concept on the author's terms. Follows Ames & Hall precedent. Works well with our glossing convention: first occurrence \"de (德)\" with a substantial glossary entry.\n- Cons: Opaque on first encounter. Requires a strong glossary entry. Some readers may feel alienated.\n- Verdict: The opacity is a *feature* in this case. 德 in 境集 is a technical term with a specific constructivist meaning. Giving it an English \"equivalent\" that is actually a *mis*-equivalent is worse than leaving it untranslated.\n\n**(b) \"Character\"** -- my second choice.\n- Pros: Captures the \"inherent nature\" sense of 德 without moral baggage. \"Character\" in English can mean both \"moral character\" and \"the character/nature of a thing,\" which partially mirrors the Confucian/Daoist duality.\n- Cons: Risks confusion with \"fictional character\" or \"Chinese character (字).\" Not established in sinological literature for 德.\n- Verdict: Viable but slightly confusing in a text that already discusses Chinese characters.\n\n**(c) \"Potency\"** -- too narrow.\n- Captures the Daoist sense well but loses the Confucian moral dimension entirely. If 德 in 境集 includes *both* senses, \"potency\" is just as one-sided as \"virtue\" but in the opposite direction.\n\n**(d) \"Virtue\"** -- I now demote this for 境集.\n- It is the right default for mainstream sinological translation, and I stand by that general recommendation.
