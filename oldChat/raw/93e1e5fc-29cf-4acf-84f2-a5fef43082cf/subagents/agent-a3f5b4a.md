*经验 → *

Author's decision on 经验:

**经验 → "experience"** as main translation, with:
- "experiential" as adjectival form (经验结构 = experiential structure, 经验形态 = experiential forms)
- "empirical experience" for disambiguation when 体验 appears nearby
- 经验性的 → "empirical"

Final four-term mapping:
- 感受 → "feeling" / "felt experience"
- 体验 → "experience" (processual/immersive)
- 经验 → "experience" (accumulated/epistemic); "experiential" (adj); "empirical experience" (disambiguation)
- 感觉 → "sensation"

Usage rule: When 经验 and 体验 co-occur in proximity, 经验 takes "experiential" (adjectival) or "empirical experience" (nominal) to disambiguate.

Please confirm or raise any final objection.
