Is losing this etymological wordplay a big problem for the reader's understanding of the passage?\n2. If so, should we add a TN explaining the 形/形而上 structure?\n3. Or is there a way to render it in English that preserves the relationship (e.g., \"above-the-phenomenal\" for 形而上)?\n\nBrief responses.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"58a314bf-c4be-4bc8-9b7f-a961e062a990","timestamp":"2026-02-11T02:37:01.108Z"}
