*前形而上学: *

The author raises a concern about 前形而上学 (qian xing er shang xue):

Current translation: "pre-metaphysics"

Problem: In English, "pre-metaphysics" sounds like "before metaphysics" — as if referring to a period before metaphysics existed. But the author's meaning is "metaphysics before nihilism" — the entire tradition from Thales through Hegel, from the Yijing through Neo-Confucianism. It IS metaphysics, just the kind done before the nihilistic crisis.

Similarly, 后形而上学 = "post-metaphysics" works better because it clearly means "after [the crisis of] metaphysics." But 前形而上学 as "pre-metaphysics" is misleading.

What's a better rendering? Some options to consider:
- "pre-nihilist metaphysics" (already listed as alternative from Chinese Philosophy expert)
- "classical metaphysics"
- "traditional metaphysics" (the author's own gloss)
- "pre-critical metaphysics" (Kantian resonance)
- Something else?

Keep your response concise — what's your recommendation and why?

This is structurally identical to Kant's pre-critical/critical distinction -- before and after becoming reflexively aware of the conditions and limits of one's own cognitive operations. Since the author's framework is explicitly about how metaphysical concepts are constructed from phenomena (a fundamentally Kantian move), \"pre-critical\" captures the right cognitive contrast.

Sent my recommendation: "pre-critical metaphysics" as the main translation. It names the structural cognitive mode (taking one's own constructions as given, before reflexive self-awareness) rather than a historical period, parallels the established Kantian pre-critical/critical usage English readers will recognize, and pairs naturally with the author's "post-metaphysics." Standing by.
