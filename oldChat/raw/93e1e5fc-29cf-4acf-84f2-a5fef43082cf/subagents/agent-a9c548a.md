*Continue Q1-Q7 expert consultations*

Good observations on the progression. Now please continue with your Q1-Q7 expert consultations. You've already gotten existentialism-expert's response on Q1. Update Q1 file, then move on to Q2 (title rendering of 境集) — send it to the relevant expert(s). Work through all 7 questions.

I've already completed both of those steps — the Q1 file was updated with the existentialism expert's response, and Q2 was sent to the Chinese philosophy expert. I also sent Q1 to the phenomenology expert for a second opinion. Both messages are in flight.

Let me check the status:
- **Q1**: Existentialism expert responded (recorded). Phenomenology expert query sent (awaiting).
- **Q2**: Chinese philosophy expert query sent (awaiting).
- **Q3-Q7**: Ready to send once I get responses.

The instructions say to send questions one at a time and wait for responses. I have two outstanding (Q1 to phenomenology, Q2 to Chinese phil). Let me wait for those to come back before proceeding.

I'm idle and ready to be woken up when responses arrive.
