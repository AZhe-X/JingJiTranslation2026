*Rank translator profile factors by importance 0-10*

FINAL RANKING REQUEST: We've consolidated the translator profile. Now please assign an importance weight (0-10) to each factor below. 10 = absolutely essential, 0 = not needed.

Score each of the following:

1. Native-level command of both Chinese and English
2. Philosophical training (not purely literary)
3. Literary sensibility (not purely academic)
4. Category theory / mathematical notation literacy
5. Experience with register shifts (colloquial ↔ technical ↔ poetic ↔ analytic)
6. Familiarity with Chinese philosophical translation conventions (how 仁/义/礼/道/德 have been rendered by Legge, Waley, Watson, Graham, Ziporyn, etc.)
7. Sensitivity to performative/experimental dimensions (experiential sequences as load-bearing content, preserving ordering/pacing/escalation)
8. Familiarity with Western existentialist/phenomenological translation conventions (standard English for Camus, Heidegger, Husserl, Sartre, Wittgenstein)
9. Familiarity with Buddhist translation chains (Sanskrit → Chinese → English)
10. Familiarity with Kantian/transcendental terminology in English
11. Familiarity with analytic philosophy of language register (Anscombe, Brandom, etc.)

Please respond with just your scores, e.g.:
1: 10, 2: 9, 3: 8, ... etc.

Brief justification for any score you give below 5 or above 9 is welcome but not required. Keep it concise.

Scores submitted with justifications for the outliers. My highest scores went to bilingual command (10), philosophical training (9), register flexibility (9), and experiential pacing sensitivity (9). Lowest scores to analytic philosophy of language (3) and Buddhist translation chains (4), as these are peripheral to the collection's core concerns.
