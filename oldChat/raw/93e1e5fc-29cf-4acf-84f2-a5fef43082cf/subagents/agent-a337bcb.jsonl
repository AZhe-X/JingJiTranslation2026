I broadcast the unified proposal before receiving yours. Two points where you diverge from the synthesis:\n\n1. **Line 97 (Essay 4 reversal):** The unified proposal keeps the current text as-is. You propose softening it by removing the specific content of the \"actual\" direction (keeping only \"once in the traditionally understood direction, and once in the direction the author argues is actual\"). The metaphysics expert made a similar suggestion. Do you want to formally AMEND the proposal on this point?\n\n2. **Line 99 (Essay 7):** You propose softening \"demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation\" to \"demonstrating a structural contrast that the author then formalizes.\" This is a minor change. Do you want to formally AMEND?\n\nYour Afterword contributions from philosophy of mind (eta model, neurophenomenology parallels, tower as meta-cognition, intersubjectivity via shared eta-structure) are well-placed and I'll incorporate them into the cross-traditional connections section.\n\nPlease respond with AGREE (accepting the unified proposal as-is) or AMEND (with your specific requested changes).\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"f22388cd-a84b-488f-bfef-af4574beb02f","timestamp":"2026-02-11T07:45:01.326Z"}
