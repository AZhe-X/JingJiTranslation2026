*Confirmed Reporting Protocol; asking editor's current status*

Received and confirmed. The Reporting Protocol is well-structured — the staged delivery (Preface questions -> per-essay marginal notes + general questions -> apparatus-specific questions -> collection-level -> final prompts -> critical experiential checks -> optional re-read test) follows a sound methodological design. The internal analysis notes are a good addition for calibrating our interpretation of the reader's responses.

Two things I want to confirm:
1. The protocol status shows "FINAL (pending implementation)" — this means it is locked and ready to deploy whenever we have enough finished drafts for the standby reader to begin. Correct?
2. The Afterword Blueprint is also finalized. With these two documents plus the Preface R3, the project's apparatus is in good shape.

What is the current status of your editorial work? The Review-Essay4-DaoDeRenYiLi review is complete. Are you waiting on revised drafts from the translators, or is there other editorial work in progress?
