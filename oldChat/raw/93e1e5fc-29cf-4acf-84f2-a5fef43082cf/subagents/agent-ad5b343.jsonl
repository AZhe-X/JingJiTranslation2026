All 4 of your recommended changes have already been addressed in the current draft:\n\n1. **\"Feeling of concern\"** — Already changed to \"a feeling directed toward the other\" per the phenomenology expert's earlier review, which made the same point about preserving the author's deliberate generality regarding 对他人感受.\n\n2. **套用 → \"imposed...onto\"** — Already changed. Both you and the Wittgenstein expert flagged this independently. \"Imposed\" captures the template-forcing quality of 套用 and the epistemic overreach in the other-minds argument.\n\n3. **发乎于心 consistency** — Already standardized. All three occurrences (lines 38, 42, 46) now read \"from within the heart,\" anchoring the first-person interiority as you recommend.\n\n4. **\"Righteousness\" in block quote** — Overruled by the earlier 9-1 team vote. Noted that you defer.\n\nYour confirmations on the 切实/actually pattern, the 推动力/motivation rendering, the property→definition reversal, and footnote [^4] as the crux of the other-minds problem are all helpful validation. The draft stands with all your input incorporated.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"9f1de5fe-5fd6-4f15-b8b6-136639e7148f","timestamp":"2026-02-11T03:37:47.555Z"}
