*Review draft translation, send feedback to translator-2*

Please review the draft translation of the 道德仁义礼 passage from Essay 4 (后形而上学 整理).

**Original Chinese**: Read the original essay at: /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录/后形而上学 整理.md (lines 18-30 for the passage, and footnotes [^3], [^4], [^24] at lines 136-138, 172)

**Draft translation**: Read /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Draft/Essay4-DaoDeRenYiLi.md

Compare the draft against the original Chinese carefully. Then send your comments, suggestions, agreements, and any concerns **directly to translator-2** via message. Focus on your area of expertise (epistemology) — the inferential structure (推断, 归纳, 解释), the property-to-definition reversal, how knowledge claims are handled.

Let me read both files to compare them.

Now let me carefully compare the draft translation against the original Chinese, focusing on epistemological concerns — the inferential structure, the property-to-definition reversal, and how knowledge claims are handled.

Sent detailed review to translator-2. Here's a summary of what I flagged:

**Praised (keep as-is):**
- The 推断/解释/套用 three-way distinction (inference/explanation/application) — epistemologically crucial and correctly rendered
- The property-to-definition reversal (属性 → 定义) — the (can)/(should) progression is precisely handled
- The "buried from view" / "lost" pairing — preserves the double meaning with the Laozi's own 失
- Consistent use of "generated" for 生成 throughout — the repetition IS the argument
- TN4 on the property→definition reversal — no changes needed

**Recommended changes:**
1. "summarized from" → "derived from" or "generalized from" (总结 is epistemic extraction, not condensation)
2. "inductively generalized" → "inductively derived" or "arrived at by induction" (avoids tautology)
3. "issues in" → "comes the practice of" for 行礼 (needs more agentive quality)
4. Standardize "arising from the heart" for 发乎于心 (心 is doing philosophical work)
5. Minor TN3 refinement to make the inductive/a priori contrast more explicit
