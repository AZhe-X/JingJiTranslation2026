To confirm the current state of your 4 actionable items:\n\n1. **\"Righteousness\" in block quote** — Not adopted, per 9-1 team vote. The 仁/义/礼 terms are consistent throughout. Unlike 德, the author makes no explicit reconceptualization of 义 mid-passage, so a righteousness/rightness split would imply a shift the author doesn't make.\n\n2. **Virtue → character in-text signal** — Not adopted. You marked this as optional. TN3 handles the shift, and adding in-text commentary would be editorial interpolation not in the original.\n\n3. **\"What ought to be\" in fn [^3]** — Applied. The draft now reads \"rightness (义) is said to be *what ought to be*.\"\n\n4. **规律 → \"regularity\"** — Applied. Both occurrences (lines 40, 44) now read \"regularity\" instead of \"pattern.\"\n\nAll set. No further action needed.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"bcc06463-bb3a-47b1-8f59-f5f58be69115","timestamp":"2026-02-11T03:39:41.612Z"}
