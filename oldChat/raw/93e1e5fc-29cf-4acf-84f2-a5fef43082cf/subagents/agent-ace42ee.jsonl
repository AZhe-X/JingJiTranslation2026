Background\n\nA well-read generalist with a humanities education — someone who reads serious nonfiction (history, science writing, cultural criticism) but is not a professional philosopher or academic. Think: a graduate-educated person who has read a few works of philosophy out of genuine interest (maybe Camus's *The Myth of Sisyphus*, maybe some popular introductions to Eastern philosophy) but does not read philosophy journals or engage with technical philosophical debates. No math background beyond high school — crucially, no category theory, no abstract algebra. This person represents the reader the Preface is written *for*: someone the author wants to reach but who needs the translation and apparatus to do the reaching.\n\n### 2. What They Should NOT Know\n\n- The content of the 境集 essays — they must read the collection cold\n- The expert analysis reports, translation discussions, and dictionary\n- The Afterword blueprint — they should not know what we think the collection \"means\"\n- Category theory or any formal mathematics beyond basic familiarity with functions and sets\n- The specific philosophical positions the author takes (nihilism-as-consequence, absurdity dissolution, the Dao-De reversal) — this is what we removed from the Preface precisely so the reader encounters it fresh\n- The Chinese language — they should be reading as a monolingual English reader, which is the primary audience for the translation\n\n### 3. What They SHOULD Know\n\n- Fluent, attentive English reading — someone who notices prose quality, who can tell when a sentence is doing work vs. padding\n- Basic philosophical literacy: knows what \"epistemology\" and \"ontology\" mean; has encountered the names Kant, Heidegger, Camus, Wittgenstein even if they haven't read them deeply; understands what \"metaphysics\" means in ordinary usage\n- Some awareness that Chinese philosophy exists as a tradition (knows \"the Dao\" is a thing, has heard of Confucius and Laozi) without detailed knowledge\n- Familiarity with the experience of reading translated works — understands that translation involves choices, that some things don't cross languages cleanly\n- Comfort with not understanding everything on first pass — willing to keep reading when something is unclear, trusting that it may become clear later\n\n### 4. Reading Instructions\n\nThe reader should be given:\n- The Translator's Preface (DRAFT-R3)\n- The Glossary Introduction\n- The essay translations as they become available, in the prescribed order\n- The Glossary\n\nThey should be told: \"Read the Preface first, then the essays in order. Do not skip ahead. Do not look anything up. Report your experience as you go.\"\n\n**What they should report on (after each essay):**\n\n- **Clarity:** Where did you get lost? What sentences or paragraphs had to be read twice? What terms were unclear even with the glossary?\n- **Experience:** Did anything happen to you while reading that felt like more than just \"understanding an argument\"? Did any example produce a shift in how you see something? (This tests the experiential sequences without telling the reader what to expect.)\n- **Momentum:** Did you want to keep reading? Where did your attention flag? Where did you feel impatient?\n- **The math:** When you hit formal notation, what happened? Did you skip it? Did the examples carry you through? Did you feel excluded or included?\n- **Tone:** Does the translation voice feel consistent? Do the essays feel like they're by the same person? Does the register shift between essays feel intentional or jarring?\n\nThey should NOT be told about the Fish/Fishing structure, the experiential-sequence methodology, or what the collection is \"trying to do\" beyond what the Preface tells them. The point is to test whether the Preface + essays succeed on their own.\n\n### 5. Personality/Disposition\n\n**Curious but not credulous.** Someone who engages genuinely with ideas but doesn't accept claims on authority — the kind of reader who thinks \"interesting, but does this actually work?\" Someone with intellectual patience (willing to sit with confusion) but not infinite patience (will flag when something genuinely doesn't land). A reader who notices their own responses — who can report \"I felt X at this point\" rather than only \"I understood/didn't understand Y.\"\n\n**Not adversarial.** The standby reader should not be looking for flaws or trying to disprove the author. But they also should not be a fan who is predisposed to be impressed. The ideal disposition is: \"I picked this up because it sounded interesting. Convince me.\"\n\n**Slightly literary.** Someone who cares about how things are written, not just what they say.
