*Final confirm on 道德仁义礼 terminology*

**FINAL CONFIRMATION — 道德仁义礼 terminology usage**

Before we move on, the author wants a final sign-off specifically on how the five key terms 道/德/仁/义/礼 are rendered in this draft. Please confirm you approve the following usage:

1. **道 (dao)** → "the Way" throughout (block quote and analysis)
2. **德 (de)** → SPLIT: "virtue" in Laozi block quote → "(constitutive) character" / "character" in analysis
3. **仁 (ren)** → "humaneness" throughout (no split)
4. **义 (yi)** → "rightness" throughout (no split)
5. **礼 (li)** → "ritual conduct" throughout (no split)
6. **现象X** → "phenomenal X" for all five when in phenomenal compounds

Reply to team-lead: **CONFIRM** or **OBJECTION** (with specifics).
