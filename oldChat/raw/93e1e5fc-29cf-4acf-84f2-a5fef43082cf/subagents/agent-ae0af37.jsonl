How misleading is \"virtue\" for 德 in this author's specific philosophical context?\n2.

I recommend against it.**\n\n**1. How misleading is \"virtue\"?**\n\nVery misleading. Let me trace the specific passage. In 后形而上学, the author defines 德 as: \"我们认为（应当是）人人皆而有之的东西\" and \"使得人而成为人的东西\" -- \"what we believe everyone (should) have\" and \"what makes a person a person.\" The author then generalizes: \"凡事诸物皆有其德（我们认为他应该遵守的规律，使得一样东西成为其本身的东西）\" -- \"all things have their 德 (the regularity we believe they should follow, what makes a thing what it is).\"\n\nThis is not virtue in the English moral sense. It is closer to the Aristotelian notion of \"essential nature\" or the scholastic \"quiddity\" -- what makes a thing the kind of thing it is. In Kantian terms, it maps onto something like the \"real essence\" or the \"concept of a natural kind\" -- the set of properties we take to be constitutive of a thing's identity.\n\nIf the reader sees \"virtue,\" they will think of moral excellence, ethical character, or at best the classical Greek arete. None of these capture the author's meaning, which is explicitly generalized beyond the human and beyond the moral: *dogs* have their 德, *things* have their 德. \"Virtue\" in English does not naturally apply to dogs and inanimate objects -- \"the virtue of a rock\" sounds odd in a way that the author's \"石头之德\" does not.\n\n**2. What about alternatives?**\n\n- **Romanized \"de\":** This is the safest option and follows the precedent we have already set with \"Jing.\" The reader learns what it means from the passage itself (the author provides a thorough explanation). A TN at first occurrence can gloss it: \"de (德): what makes a thing what it is; often translated as 'virtue' in Confucian contexts or 'potency' in Daoist contexts, but the author uses it in a broader sense: the constitutive character or inherent nature of any entity.\"\n\n- **\"Inherent nature\":** Accurate to the author's usage but loses the Chinese philosophical resonance entirely. Also somewhat clunky in running prose.\n\n- **\"Character\":** Better than \"virtue\" -- \"the character of a thing\" works in English for both persons and non-persons. But it is ambiguous (literary character? moral character? written character?) and too bland to signal that this is a technical philosophical term.\n\n- **\"Potency\":** Too specifically Daoist (Waley's translation of 德 in the Daodejing). The author's usage is broader.\n\n**3. Is a TN/glossary sufficient to correct \"virtue\"?**\n\nNo. \"Virtue\" is too deeply entrenched in English moral philosophy. When a reader sees \"all things have their virtue\" or \"the virtue of dogs,\" the moral connotation will clash with the text at every occurrence, not just the first. A TN can correct the first impression, but it cannot override the reader's lifelong association between \"virtue\" and moral excellence at every subsequent encounter. This is unlike terms where the TN redirects a mild ambiguity -- \"virtue\" creates an active misreading that the reader must fight against throughout.\n\n**My recommendation:** Romanize as \"de\" with a TN. We are already asking the reader to learn \"Jing.\" Adding \"de\" is a small additional burden, and the author's own explanation of what 德 means in the passage is so thorough that the reader will have a clear understanding within a few sentences.
