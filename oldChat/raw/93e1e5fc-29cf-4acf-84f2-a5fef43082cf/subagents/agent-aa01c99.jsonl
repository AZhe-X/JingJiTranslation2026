Cf. Ivanhoe: 'When the Way was lost there was Virtue; When Virtue was lost there was benevolence; When benevolence was lost there was righteousness; When righteousness was lost there were the rites.' We render 仁 as 'humaneness' (following Ames & Rosemont) rather than 'benevolence,' 义 as 'rightness' rather than 'righteousness' to capture the author's usage as motivational disposition rather than moral judgment, and 礼 as 'ritual conduct' to emphasize the behavioral dimension.\"\n5. **德 shift TN**: At the transition where the author redefines 德, include a note: \"The author now reconceives 德 not as virtue in the moral sense but as (constitutive) character — the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena. Hereafter shortened to 'character.'\"\n6. **Footnotes**: Translate the author's footnotes [^3], [^4], [^24] as well.\n7. **The philosophical experiment must work**: The English reader needs to FEEL the conventional top-down reading (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness...) and then experience the reversal when the author shows it's actually constructed bottom-up.\n\nHere is the full original text:\n\n---\n\n请看如下例子：\n\n> 故失*道*而后*德*，失*德*而后*仁*，失*仁*而后*义*，失*义*而后*礼*。——老子\n\n其中，*道*，*德*，*仁*，*义*，*礼*，自前往后，既是从上至下。*道*生万物，*道*既是最\"元始\"的*元物理*（*metaphysics*），而有此往后，皆是*生成*的。因此，道既是最上者，是为形而上，而礼既是最下者，是为形。\n\n然而，礼事实上是从现象所总结出来的，我们不妨将这个**切实**的*现象*中的行为称之为\"*现象礼*\"，我对\"*现象礼*\"有一个**解释**，既是我对人时发乎于心的对他人感受，这个感受是我个人**切实**感受到的，因而是*现象*的一部分，因此我将其称之为\"*现象仁*\"。这个感受使得我想要去如何如何地对待他人，这种推动力（motivation）也是我所**切实**感受到的，因此我将其称之为\"*现象义*\"[^3]。\"*现象礼*\"不仅仅存在于在我对待他人时，也同样存在于其他人是如何对待他人上，我们便将\"*现象仁*\"和\"*现象义*\"作为我们对\"*现象礼*\"的**解释**推而广之。也就是说，因为\"*现象礼*\"（似乎）在我们周围的所有人身上都有体现，而我们认为（将\"*现象礼*\"解释为）\"*现象仁*\"产生了\"*现象义*\"又产生了\"*现象礼*\"，所以我们认为所有（行\"现象礼\"的）人都（应当）有这种\"*现象仁*\"[^4]。接下来，我们便把我们认为（应当是）人人皆而有之的东西，在这里便是\"*现象仁*\"，称之为\"*德*\"，而为什么会有这种人人皆而有之的**规律**呢？因为\"*道*\"[^24]。\n\n因此我们看到，在现象的层面上，*仁义*仅仅是对于*礼*的一个解释。对于我们看到的外在的*现象*而言，事实上我们仅仅看到了*现象*中的\"*现象礼*\"，因而我们**推断**出了\"*现象义*\"，续而由\"*现象义*\"**推断**出了\"*现象仁*\"，即便并**没有**任何**切实**的\"*现象义*\"和\"*现象仁*\"出现在我的*现象*中，因为**我**所感受到的发乎于心的感受和推动力仅仅是**我**在行\"*现象礼*\"时所感受到的，而我无法真正感受到**他人**的内心感受，仅仅是将我对\"**自己**的'*现象礼*'\"的解释**套用**到了我们看到的**别人**所行的\"*现象礼*\"上。因此，别人身上的*仁义*，其实是由*现象*中的\"*现象礼*\"所生成的。但是我们在解释上却认为是由*仁*而生*义*，因*义*而行*礼*，\"*现象礼*\"反而是由*仁义*所生成的了。接下来，基于这种生成的*仁义*，我们便总结出来，\"人都是有*仁*的\"。但是，事实上是\"人都是（**可以**）有*仁*的\"，因为我们是从诸多有*仁*的人身上发现许多人都是有*仁*的，因此*仁*是我们归纳出来的一个**属性**（**property**）。但是我们最终对其的理解是\"人都是（**应该**）有*仁*的\"——或者说，\"有*仁*的才是人\"。因此人可以拥有的一个**属性**，在这里既是\"*仁*\"，反而变成了人的一个**定义**。而这些**定义**合起来，便定义了**什么是*人***——也就是\"*德*\"，使得*人*而成为*人*的东西。因此我们看到，事实上\"*德*\"也是由\"*仁*\"生成的，但是我们在理解上却认为，是因\"*德*\"而生\"*仁*\"：因为你是*人*，所以你要有*仁*。最后，\"*德*\"是一种一般的规律，因为凡事诸物皆有其*德*（我们认为他应该遵守的规律，使得一样东西成为其本身的东西），因而又将所有的\"*德*\"合起来，归纳抽象出\"*道*\"，因此\"*道*\"实则为\"*德*\"而生成的，我们却理解为\"*道*\"生成了\"*德*\"。\n\n因此，整个逻辑的顺序就被倒反过来。道生德，人德为仁，因仁生义，因义行礼。而这最后的\"*礼*\"已经不再是一开始的\"*现象礼*\"，因为从\"*现象礼*\"生成\"*道*\"的逻辑已经被**掩埋不见**，已经全部**失**去了，人们以为\"*道*\"才是最元始的*元物理*。因此最终生成的\"*礼*\"已然仅仅是一种规范，而不一定是最初的（解释上）发乎于心的而有的*现象礼*了。\n\n在实践中，这种失将继续层层下跌，逐末而忘本。上述并非对《老子》的解释，而是在这一段当中，恰好出现了这种自形而上至形的阶梯，因此将此作为一个例子。\n\n[^3]: 仁义礼实则是已经是一套形而上的框架了。而我们又不得不借助一些框架来描述现象，因而即便我极力尝试还原其作为现象的本来面貌，但是其仍旧是失准的。中国哲学常将仁义并提。所谓仁，是谓爱人。所谓义，是谓应当。按照形式上的理解，以爱父亲这一仁来举例。我爱我的父亲所应当做的，就是义。而这个义的具体行为，则是礼。因而义是连接仁和具体行为（礼）的那个东西。在现象上，我这里用现象仁来描述我内心对我父亲的某种（爱的）感受，这个感受使得（推动）我去做一些行为。那么这种推动力，这种\"motivation\"本身，就是连接我的这种感受（现象仁）和我的这种行为（现象礼）的东西，因而把它叫做现象义是合适的。\n\n[^4]: 这种推而广之的别人身上的\"现象仁\"和\"现象义\"已经不在我的现象之中了。\n\n[^24]: 此处需要注意，更加符合道家的关于\"道\"的解释更类似于使得存在得以成立的那个东西。形象地说，就像是对于一幅画而言的画纸一样。在这里，我们仅仅是结构上表达可以认为\"道\"决定和产生了\"德\"。\n\n---\n\nWrite your draft in `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L.

The Way generates all things; the Way is the most \"primordial\" *metaphysics*, and everything that follows from it is *generated*. Thus the Way is the highest — it is the metaphysical — while ritual conduct is the lowest — it is the phenomenal.[^TN2]\n\nHowever, ritual conduct is in fact summarized from phenomena. Let us call the **actual** behavior in phenomena \"phenomenal ritual conduct.\" I have an **explanation** for phenomenal ritual conduct: it is the feeling that arises from within me when I face another person — a feeling of concern for the other. This feeling is something I **actually** feel, and is therefore part of phenomena; I call it \"phenomenal humaneness.\" This feeling impels me to treat the other person in such-and-such a way; this driving force (*motivation*) is also something I **actually** feel, and so I call it \"phenomenal rightness.\"[^3] Phenomenal ritual conduct exists not only in how I treat others, but equally in how other people treat one another. We therefore extend phenomenal humaneness and phenomenal rightness as our **explanation** of phenomenal ritual conduct more broadly. That is to say: because phenomenal ritual conduct (apparently) manifests in everyone around us, and because we interpret phenomenal ritual conduct as \"phenomenal humaneness generates phenomenal rightness, which in turn generates phenomenal ritual conduct,\" we conclude that everyone who practices phenomenal ritual conduct (ought to) possess this phenomenal humaneness.[^4]\n\nNext, we take what we believe (ought to be) universally possessed — here, phenomenal humaneness — and call it \"character.\"[^TN3] And why should there be such a universal pattern? Because of \"the Way.\"[^24]\n\nWe can now see that, at the level of phenomena, humaneness and rightness are merely an *explanation* of ritual conduct. As for what we observe of external phenomena, in fact we have only seen the phenomenal ritual conduct within phenomena, and from it we **infer** phenomenal rightness, and from phenomenal rightness we **infer** phenomenal humaneness — even though **no** actual phenomenal rightness or phenomenal humaneness appears in *my* phenomena, because the feeling that arises from within and the driving force are only what **I** feel when **I** practice phenomenal ritual conduct. I cannot truly feel **another person's** inner feelings; I have merely **applied** my explanation of \"**my own** phenomenal ritual conduct\" to the phenomenal ritual conduct we observe **others** performing. Therefore, the humaneness and rightness in other people are in fact *generated from* the phenomenal ritual conduct in phenomena. But in our interpretation, we take it to be the reverse: humaneness generates rightness, and rightness issues in ritual conduct — as though phenomenal ritual conduct were generated *by* humaneness and rightness.\n\nNext, on the basis of this generated humaneness and rightness, we conclude: \"all people possess humaneness.\" But in fact it is: \"all people (**can**) possess humaneness,\" since we discovered from many people who exhibit humaneness that many people have it — humaneness is thus a **property** we have inductively generalized. Yet our final understanding becomes: \"all people (**should**) possess humaneness\" — or rather, \"only those who possess humaneness count as human.\" And so a **property** that a person can have — here, humaneness — is transformed into a **definition** of personhood. These definitions, taken together, define **what a person is** — that is, \"character\": that which makes a person a person.[^TN4] We thus see that character, too, is in fact generated from humaneness — yet in our understanding we take it to be the reverse: *because* you are a person, *therefore* you must possess humaneness. Finally, character is a general pattern, because all things have their character (the pattern we take them to follow, that which makes a thing what it is), and so we gather all instances of character together, inductively abstract from them, and arrive at \"the Way.\" The Way, then, is in fact generated from character — yet we understand it as the Way generating character.\n\nThus the entire logical order is reversed. The Way generates character; the character of a person is humaneness; from humaneness arises rightness; from rightness comes ritual conduct. But this final \"ritual conduct\" is no longer the original phenomenal ritual conduct, because the logic by which phenomenal ritual conduct generated \"the Way\" has been **buried from view** — it has been entirely **lost**. People take the Way to be the most primordial metaphysics. And so the ritual conduct that is finally generated is now merely a norm, and not necessarily the original phenomenal ritual conduct that (in the explanation) arose from within the heart.\n\nIn practice, this loss continues cascading downward, level after level — pursuing the branches and forgetting the root. The above is not an interpretation of the *Laozi*; rather, in this passage there happens to appear precisely this kind of staircase running from the metaphysical down to the phenomenal, and so I use it here as an example.\n\n---\n\n## Footnotes\n\n[^3]: Humaneness, rightness, and ritual conduct are in fact already a metaphysical framework. And yet we cannot help but rely on some framework to describe phenomena; thus even though I have tried my utmost to restore their original phenomenal character, the account remains imprecise. In Chinese philosophy, humaneness and rightness are often mentioned together. Humaneness (仁) is said to be *loving others*; rightness (义) is said to be *what one ought to do*. In the conventional understanding — to take loving one's father as an example of humaneness — what I *ought to do* out of love for my father is rightness. And the concrete behavior that fulfills this rightness is ritual conduct. Rightness is thus the thing that connects humaneness to concrete action (ritual conduct). At the phenomenal level, I use \"phenomenal humaneness\" to describe the inner feeling (of love) I have toward my father — a feeling that impels me to act in certain ways. This driving force, this \"motivation\" itself, is what connects my feeling (phenomenal humaneness) to my behavior (phenomenal ritual conduct), and so it is fitting to call it phenomenal rightness.\n\n[^4]: The phenomenal humaneness and phenomenal rightness thus extended to others are no longer within *my* phenomena.\n\n[^24]: A note of caution: the interpretation of \"the Way\" (道) more faithful to Daoist thought would be closer to *that which makes existence itself possible* — pictorially, something like the canvas on which a painting is made. Here, we are merely expressing in structural terms that \"the Way\" can be understood to determine and generate \"character.\"\n\n---\n\n## Translator's Notes\n\n[^TN1]: Translation adapted from Ivanhoe (2003). Key terms follow this volume's glossary. Cf. Ivanhoe: \"When the Way was lost there was Virtue; When Virtue was lost there was benevolence; When benevolence was lost there was righteousness; When righteousness was lost there were the rites.\" We render 仁 as \"humaneness\" (following Ames & Rosemont) rather than \"benevolence,\" 义 as \"rightness\" rather than \"righteousness\" to capture the author's usage as motivational disposition rather than moral judgment, and 礼 as \"ritual conduct\" to emphasize the behavioral dimension.\n\n[^TN2]: The author interprets 形 (xing, \"form\") in the classical term 形而上 as equivalent to 现象 (phenomena). In the *Xici zhuan* (Commentary on the Appended Phrases, *Yijing*), 形 conventionally means \"visible form\" or \"physical shape.\" The author's reinterpretation — phenomena as the ground, the metaphysical as what is built upon it — is a significant philosophical departure. See the Translator's Introduction for further discussion.\n\n[^TN3]: The author now reconceives 德 (de) not as virtue in the moral sense but as (constitutive) character — the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. Hereafter shortened to \"character.\" This constructivist reading departs from both the standard Confucian sense of 德 as moral virtue and the Daoist sense of 德 as natural potency.\n\n[^TN4]: Note the crucial reversal: a *property* that people happen to have (observed inductively) becomes a *definition* of what people are (imposed normatively). This is the mechanism by which phenomena are transformed into the metaphysical — the bottom-up construction is concealed, and the result appears to be top-down.\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":138,"cache_read_input_tokens":139858,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":138},"output_tokens":25,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY1VmFFa21NsMsavjBcqE","type":"assistant","uuid":"ef7e46e7-86ec-4608-a7d6-41784d9191ca","timestamp":"2026-02-11T02:32:14.041Z"}

The Way generates all things; the Way is the most \"primordial\" *metaphysics*, and everything that follows from it is *generated*. Thus the Way is the highest — it is the metaphysical — while ritual conduct is the lowest — it is the phenomenal.[^TN2]\n\nHowever, ritual conduct is in fact summarized from phenomena. Let us call the **actual** behavior in phenomena \"phenomenal ritual conduct.\" I have an **explanation** for phenomenal ritual conduct: it is the feeling that arises from within me when I face another person — a feeling of concern for the other. This feeling is something I **actually** feel, and is therefore part of phenomena; I call it \"phenomenal humaneness.\" This feeling impels me to treat the other person in such-and-such a way; this driving force (*motivation*) is also something I **actually** feel, and so I call it \"phenomenal rightness.\"[^3] Phenomenal ritual conduct exists not only in how I treat others, but equally in how other people treat one another. We therefore extend phenomenal humaneness and phenomenal rightness as our **explanation** of phenomenal ritual conduct more broadly. That is to say: because phenomenal ritual conduct (apparently) manifests in everyone around us, and because we interpret phenomenal ritual conduct as \"phenomenal humaneness generates phenomenal rightness, which in turn generates phenomenal ritual conduct,\" we conclude that everyone who practices phenomenal ritual conduct (ought to) possess this phenomenal humaneness.[^4]\n\nNext, we take what we believe (ought to be) universally possessed — here, phenomenal humaneness — and call it \"character.\"[^TN3] And why should there be such a universal pattern? Because of \"the Way.\"[^24]\n\nWe can now see that, at the level of phenomena, humaneness and rightness are merely an *explanation* of ritual conduct. As for what we observe of external phenomena, in fact we have only seen the phenomenal ritual conduct within phenomena, and from it we **infer** phenomenal rightness, and from phenomenal rightness we **infer** phenomenal humaneness — even though **no** actual phenomenal rightness or phenomenal humaneness appears in *my* phenomena, because the feeling that arises from within and the driving force are only what **I** feel when **I** practice phenomenal ritual conduct. I cannot truly feel **another person's** inner feelings; I have merely **applied** my explanation of \"**my own** phenomenal ritual conduct\" to the phenomenal ritual conduct we observe **others** performing. Therefore, the humaneness and rightness in other people are in fact *generated from* the phenomenal ritual conduct in phenomena. But in our interpretation, we take it to be the reverse: humaneness generates rightness, and rightness issues in ritual conduct — as though phenomenal ritual conduct were generated *by* humaneness and rightness.\n\nNext, on the basis of this generated humaneness and rightness, we conclude: \"all people possess humaneness.\" But in fact it is: \"all people (**can**) possess humaneness,\" since we discovered from many people who exhibit humaneness that many people have it — humaneness is thus a **property** we have inductively generalized. Yet our final understanding becomes: \"all people (**should**) possess humaneness\" — or rather, \"only those who possess humaneness count as human.\" And so a **property** that a person can have — here, humaneness — is transformed into a **definition** of personhood. These definitions, taken together, define **what a person is** — that is, \"character\": that which makes a person a person.[^TN4] We thus see that character, too, is in fact generated from humaneness — yet in our understanding we take it to be the reverse: *because* you are a person, *therefore* you must possess humaneness. Finally, character is a general pattern, because all things have their character (the pattern we take them to follow, that which makes a thing what it is), and so we gather all instances of character together, inductively abstract from them, and arrive at \"the Way.\" The Way, then, is in fact generated from character — yet we understand it as the Way generating character.\n\nThus the entire logical order is reversed. The Way generates character; the character of a person is humaneness; from humaneness arises rightness; from rightness comes ritual conduct. But this final \"ritual conduct\" is no longer the original phenomenal ritual conduct, because the logic by which phenomenal ritual conduct generated \"the Way\" has been **buried from view** — it has been entirely **lost**. People take the Way to be the most primordial metaphysics. And so the ritual conduct that is finally generated is now merely a norm, and not necessarily the original phenomenal ritual conduct that (in the explanation) arose from within the heart.\n\nIn practice, this loss continues cascading downward, level after level — pursuing the branches and forgetting the root. The above is not an interpretation of the *Laozi*; rather, in this passage there happens to appear precisely this kind of staircase running from the metaphysical down to the phenomenal, and so I use it here as an example.\n\n---\n\n## Footnotes\n\n[^3]: Humaneness, rightness, and ritual conduct are in fact already a metaphysical framework. And yet we cannot help but rely on some framework to describe phenomena; thus even though I have tried my utmost to restore their original phenomenal character, the account remains imprecise. In Chinese philosophy, humaneness and rightness are often mentioned together. Humaneness (仁) is said to be *loving others*; rightness (义) is said to be *what one ought to do*. In the conventional understanding — to take loving one's father as an example of humaneness — what I *ought to do* out of love for my father is rightness. And the concrete behavior that fulfills this rightness is ritual conduct. Rightness is thus the thing that connects humaneness to concrete action (ritual conduct). At the phenomenal level, I use \"phenomenal humaneness\" to describe the inner feeling (of love) I have toward my father — a feeling that impels me to act in certain ways. This driving force, this \"motivation\" itself, is what connects my feeling (phenomenal humaneness) to my behavior (phenomenal ritual conduct), and so it is fitting to call it phenomenal rightness.\n\n[^4]: The phenomenal humaneness and phenomenal rightness thus extended to others are no longer within *my* phenomena.\n\n[^24]: A note of caution: the interpretation of \"the Way\" (道) more faithful to Daoist thought would be closer to *that which makes existence itself possible* — pictorially, something like the canvas on which a painting is made. Here, we are merely expressing in structural terms that \"the Way\" can be understood to determine and generate \"character.\"\n\n---\n\n## Translator's Notes\n\n[^TN1]: Translation adapted from Ivanhoe (2003). Key terms follow this volume's glossary. Cf. Ivanhoe: \"When the Way was lost there was Virtue; When Virtue was lost there was benevolence; When benevolence was lost there was righteousness; When righteousness was lost there were the rites.\" We render 仁 as \"humaneness\" (following Ames & Rosemont) rather than \"benevolence,\" 义 as \"rightness\" rather than \"righteousness\" to capture the author's usage as motivational disposition rather than moral judgment, and 礼 as \"ritual conduct\" to emphasize the behavioral dimension.\n\n[^TN2]: The author interprets 形 (xing, \"form\") in the classical term 形而上 as equivalent to 现象 (phenomena). In the *Xici zhuan* (Commentary on the Appended Phrases, *Yijing*), 形 conventionally means \"visible form\" or \"physical shape.\" The author's reinterpretation — phenomena as the ground, the metaphysical as what is built upon it — is a significant philosophical departure. See the Translator's Introduction for further discussion.\n\n[^TN3]: The author now reconceives 德 (de) not as virtue in the moral sense but as (constitutive) character — the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. Hereafter shortened to \"character.\" This constructivist reading departs from both the standard Confucian sense of 德 as moral virtue and the Daoist sense of 德 as natural potency.\n\n[^TN4]: Note the crucial reversal: a *property* that people happen to have (observed inductively) becomes a *definition* of what people are (imposed normatively). This is the mechanism by which phenomena are transformed into the metaphysical — the bottom-up construction is concealed, and the result appears to be top-down.\n","structuredPatch":[],"originalFile":null},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"ef7e46e7-86ec-4608-a7d6-41784d9191ca"}
