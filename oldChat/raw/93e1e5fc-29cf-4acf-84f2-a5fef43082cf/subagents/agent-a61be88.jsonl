Make your case, respond to the other positions, and see if you can reach consensus. Is the pejorative connotation of \"intoxicated\" a feature (the author IS describing a state of unknowing) or a bug (the author is not morally condemning pre-metaphysical existence)?\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"144cf5c7-5332-47f1-ac33-ea49aa0f6ca9","timestamp":"2026-02-11T00:37:44.706Z"}
