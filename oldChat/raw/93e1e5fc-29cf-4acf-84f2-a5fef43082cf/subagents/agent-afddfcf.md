*经验 and 体验 both *

Follow-up on the 经验 vote. The author (team lead) raises a concern:

If we set 经验 → "experience" as main, then both 经验 AND 体验 have "experience" as their main translation. The full mapping would be:

- 感受 → "feeling" / "felt experience"
- 体验 → "experience"
- 经验 → "experience"
- 感觉 → "sensation"

Two different Chinese terms with the same English main translation. Is this acceptable, or does it create a problem?

If you think it's fine, explain why. If you think it's a problem, what's your solution — should one of them change?

It is always *an experience* — countable, bounded, something you undergo.\n\n经验 appears as: \"经验的总结\" (empirical summary), \"经验性的\" (empirical), \"经验结构\" (experiential structure), \"经验与模式\" (experience and patterns). It is almost always adjectival or mass-noun — the accumulated stock of what you have encountered.\n\nIn English, these are already two different senses of \"experience\": \"I had an experience\" (体验) vs. \"experience teaches us\" (经验)

Explained why the overlap is not a real problem: 体验 and 经验 use different senses of "experience" that English readers disambiguate from syntax and context. Proposed keeping "experience" as main for both, with a disambiguation note in the dictionary entry for 经验. Standing by.
