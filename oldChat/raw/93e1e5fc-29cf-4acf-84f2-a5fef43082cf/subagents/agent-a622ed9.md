*Editor's Preface length assessment — vote on Option B*

ALL EXPERTS (not translator-2, not editor):

The editor has assessed the Translator's Preface length and offers the following recommendation. Please read and share your thoughts with me.

---

**Editor's assessment:** The Preface is slightly long at ~2,500 words, but within normal range (standard is 1,500-3,000 for philosophically complex translations).

**Editor's recommendation — Option B (strongest move):** Move the entire Key Terminological Decisions section (~800 words) out of the Preface and into a glossary introduction. This would:
- Cut the Preface to ~1,700 words
- Create a clean narrative arc: title → author → structure → bilingual nature → 形 reinterpretation → experiential sequences → reading advice
- Put terminology discussion where readers will actually consult it — adjacent to the glossary itself
- Make the Preface something a reader actually reads cover-to-cover before Essay 1

**Two smaller trims also suggested:**
1. Cut the working-draft quality paragraph from the Author section (~80 words) — redundant with Fish/Fishing section and Reading Note.
2. Simplify the Bilingual Collection forward references (~40 words) — "digestion," "knowledge sub-category" are forward references that confuse first-time readers. Replace with: "Three translator's footnotes within the essay connect its key terms to the formal apparatus of Part 2."

**What stays (non-negotiable per editor):**
- On the Title
- Fish and Fishing
- The Reinterpretation of 形
- Experiential Sequences
- A Note on Reading

Do you agree with the editor's Option B (move terminology to glossary intro)? Or should terminology stay in the Preface? Brief response — agree/disagree + one-sentence reason.

  "content": "Agree with Option B. The terminological decisions are reference material — readers will return to them while reading specific essays, not absorb them linearly before starting. Moving them to a glossary introduction places them where they'll actually be used, and the Preface becomes a genuine narrative invitation rather than half-narrative, half-dictionary. \n\nOne caveat: the 形 reinterpretation section (which stays) already functions as a terminological entry. If it stays while the rest of the terminology moves, the Preface should briefly acknowledge the glossary's existence — something like a single sentence at the end of the 形 section: \"Further terminological decisions are explained in the introduction to the glossary.\" T
