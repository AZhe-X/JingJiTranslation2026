Here is my editorial assessment of your four recommendations, checked against the current R2 state of the protocol:\n\n---\n\n**1. The \"experience\" prime (your structural concern)**\n\nGood news: the question you flagged (\"Did you feel like the essay was asking you to experience something...\") does NOT appear in the current R2 protocol. The current Q4 reads: \"How would you describe what this essay was asking you to do — follow an argument? Notice something? Something else?\" This was already softened in R2 per the unified revision plan. So your concern is already resolved — the current wording invites the reader to characterize the essay's mode without naming \"experience\" as the expected answer. No further change needed here.\n\nThat said, your suggestion to add a retrospective version to the full-collection report is good. Something like: \"Did you feel the essays were asking you to experience something, not just understand arguments? If so, when did you first notice this?\" would fit naturally among the collection-level questions (lines 60-64) and would give us the data without priming during the per-essay phase. I support adding this.\n\n---\n\n**2. Essay-specific per-essay questions**\n\nThis is where I have to be careful. The R2 revision notes record: \"No essay-specific per-essay questions (unanimous). Two limited per-essay exceptions for apparatus/accessibility (Essays 4, 6-7).\" This was decided by full-team consensus.\n\nYour proposed questions are well-crafted. The three constraints (backward-looking only, experiential not analytical, limited to 1-2 per essay) are exactly right as safeguards. Several of your proposals are genuinely good:\n\n- **Essay 3** (\"Of the three examples, which one affected you most? Why?\") is elegant — it asks for the reader's experience without naming the progression. This is the strongest of the set.\n- **Essay 4** (\"Was there a moment where the direction of the argument surprised you?\") is clean and backward-looking.\n- **Appendix** (\"Did this feel like an ending? Did it change the shape of the collection?\") is useful.\n\nHowever, I see risks with some others:\n\n- **Essay 1** (\"did your sense of what 'collective interest' means change from where you started?\") presupposes that a change SHOULD have occurred. A reader who answers \"no\" might feel they failed. The generic Q2 (\"Was there a moment where something clicked or shifted?\") already captures this without the presupposition.\n- **Essay 5** (\"Could you explain it to someone?\") asks the reader to perform comprehension. This might activate a different mode (testing/performing) rather than reporting on experience. It risks making the reader feel evaluated.\n- **Essay 7** (\"Was there a passage where you felt you truly *understood* something versus one where you only followed the words?\") is analytically sharp but uses \"truly understood\" in italics, which carries a normative charge. The reader might infer what we want them to say.\n\nMy recommendation: If the team decides to reopen the \"no essay-specific questions\" decision, the strongest candidates are Essays 3, 4, and the Appendix. But this requires re-voting since it overturns a unanimous decision. I will forward this proposal to the team-lead for consideration.\n\n---\n\n**3. Preface expectation-baseline question**\n\nThe current protocol already has two questions that serve this function:\n- Q4: \"Based on the preface alone, what kind of reading experience are you expecting?\"\n- Q5: \"Is there anything from the Preface that you're now anticipating or looking for in the essays?\"\n\nYour proposed question (\"After reading the Preface, what do you expect the collection to be like?\") would be redundant with Q4. So this is already covered. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**4. Endorsement of Critical Experiential Checks placement**\n\nAgreed and noted. The three-layer evidence structure (spontaneous -> general questions -> specific probes) is good phenomenological method, as you say. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my editorial recommendation to team-lead:**\n\n- One addition: Add the retrospective \"experience\" question to the full-collection report (your point 1, adapted).\n- One proposal requiring team vote: A limited set of essay-specific per-essay questions (Essays 3, 4, Appendix only — the three strongest from your set), subject to overturning the prior unanimous decision.\n- Two items already resolved: The \"experience\" prime is already absent from R2; the Preface baseline is already covered.\n\nI will forward this to the team-lead.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"ec0f28dd-9a57-47f3-b63d-17bf4dc94c27","timestamp":"2026-02-11T08:56:43.430Z"}
