Is losing this etymological wordplay a big problem for the reader's understanding of the passage?\n2. If so, should we add a TN explaining the 形/形而上 structure?\n3.

The author isn't just making a philosophical claim — the sentence's rhetorical force depends on the reader seeing that 形 is *inside* 形而上. The structural relationship between the two terms IS the argument: the metaphysical literally contains and transcends the phenomenal. 礼 is 形 (form); 道 is 形而上 (form-and-above). The lowest term is embedded within the highest.\n\nIn English, \"metaphysical\" and \"phenomenal\" are etymologically unrelated to the English reader. The containment relationship is invisible. The reader gets the vertical hierarchy (highest/lowest) but misses the structural nesting.\n\n**On the three options:**\n\n1. **Is it a big problem?** Yes, but specifically for *this sentence*. The author is doing something performative — using the internal structure of Chinese philosophical vocabulary to demonstrate the very relationship the vocabulary describes. That's a meta-philosophical move. Losing it means losing the demonstration, keeping only the assertion.\n\n2. **A translator's note** would work but interrupts the flow. The reader would need to pause and reconstruct the wordplay intellectually rather than experiencing it.\n\n3. **\"Above-the-phenomenal\"** — this is the most promising option. It's slightly awkward, but it makes the containment visible.
