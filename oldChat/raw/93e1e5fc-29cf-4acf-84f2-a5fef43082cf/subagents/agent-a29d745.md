*Review Reporting-Protocol, send feedback to editor*

Task: Review the Reporting-Protocol.md (in Standby Reader directory) and send your advice, suggestions, or confirmation to **editor**. 

The file is at: `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Standby Reader/Reporting-Protocol.md`

Read the file, then send your feedback directly to **editor** (not to me). Editor will orchestrate everyone's suggestions and discuss back and forth until a plan is agreed. Use your own judgment throughout.

One suggestion from the project lead to consider: **Should we add essay-specific questions alongside the general per-essay questions?** For example, after Essay 1 we might ask something tailored to what Essay 1 does, after Essay 2 something tailored to Essay 2, etc. — not just the same generic template for every essay. Think about whether this would be valuable, what those questions might look like, and whether they risk priming the reader (the same concern that led us to extract this file in the first place).

Send your feedback to **editor** when ready.

The four-stage design (per-essay -> collection-level -> final prompts -> critical experiential checks) is the right sequence — it moves from immediate response to reflective synthesis to targeted probes, each stage building on the previous without contaminating it.\n\n### Specific Feedback\n\n**1. The per-essay template (lines 28-32) is good but slightly too philosophical in framing.**\n\nLine 31 — \"Did you feel like the essay was asking you to *experience* something rather than just understand an argument?\" — is a leading question for a non-specialist reader. It presupposes the experie
