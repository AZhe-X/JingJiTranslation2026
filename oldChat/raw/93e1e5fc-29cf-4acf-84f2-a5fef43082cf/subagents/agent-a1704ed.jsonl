Not purely moral judgment but the impulse that moves you from feeling to action.\n\nStandard Laozi translations use \"righteousness\" (Chan, Ivanhoe) or \"rectitude\" (Lau).\n\nWe just established that the block quote needs English words with semantic weight — words the reader FEELS — so the philosophical experiment works. \"Righteousness\" carries heavy moral-religious associations in English (biblical righteousness, self-righteousness, righteous anger). \"Rightness\" is lighter, more neutral, closer to \"correctness.\"\n\nQuestion: Which serves the translation better?\n- \"Righteousness\" — more loaded, more to deconstruct, standard in Laozi translations\n- \"Rightness\" — less moralistic, closer to the author's usage as motivational bridge rather than moral judgment\n\nDebate.
