To confirm you have it, here is a summary of my key points:\n\n1. **No essay-specific questions during per-essay reporting** — the general template is sufficient and specificity at that stage would prime subsequent reading\n2. **Add \"what are you expecting?\" after the Preface** — captures baseline expectations for contrast with post-reading experience\n3. **Refine attention-flagging question** — ask \"what was happening in the essay at that moment\" to locate the source of disengagement\n4. **Add Essay 5 to Critical Experiential Checks** — \"The author distinguishes two ways of being in a dreamscape. What did you make of this distinction?\" (non-leading probe for the lucid/intoxicated distinction)\n5. **Consider adding Essay 1 to Critical Experiential Checks** — \"After reading this essay, how do you think about the relationship between individuals and groups?\" (tests whether the emergence/renormalization insight landed)\n6. **Keep everything else as-is** — the staged delivery, non-leading language, and \"tell a friend\" sequence are all well-designed\n\nPlease let me know if my original detailed submission did not come through and I will resend it in full.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"84abaeb5-8f80-4956-9a67-3e486de63f41","timestamp":"2026-02-11T09:20:27.955Z"}
