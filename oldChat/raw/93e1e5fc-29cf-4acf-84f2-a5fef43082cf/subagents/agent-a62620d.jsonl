Here is what I adopted and what I declined, with reasoning:\n\n**Adopted:**\n\n1. **\"meta-physics\" (hyphenated) for 元物理** (concern 2) — Good catch. The author deliberately uses 元物理 instead of 形而上学, and the hyphen preserves that etymological self-consciousness. Applied in both occurrences (lines 36 and 46). Added \"(元物理)\" on first occurrence for readers who want the Chinese.\n\n2. **\"(德)\" after first \"character\" in analysis** (concern 3) — Agreed, this creates the explicit callback to the block quote's \"virtue (德, de).\" The reader now sees the same character and registers the reconception.\n\n**Declined:**\n\n3. **Scare quotes on \"generates\"** (concern 1) — The author does not mark 生 typographically in the original. More importantly, scare quotes would telegraph the reversal before the reader has experienced the received view. The philosophical experiment requires the reader to accept the top-down framing first, *then* feel the inversion. Signaling doubt prematurely weakens this.\n\n4. **\"Constitutes\" bridging word in TN4** (concern 4) — The existing TN4 phrasing (\"a property... becomes a definition\") captures the reversal without importing Kantian terminology. The parallel to constitutive principles is real but belongs in secondary commentary, not the translator's apparatus, which should serve all readers.\n\n5. **本/末 TN** (concern 5) — Agreed this is low priority. The English metaphor works well enough, and adding a TN for a proverb would over-annotate.\n\n6. **Rightness consistency** (concern 6) — Confirmed, no change needed. TN1 already explains the departure from standard translations.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"57f83664-7d36-4ef4-8630-f844fede7612","timestamp":"2026-02-11T03:28:49.474Z"}
