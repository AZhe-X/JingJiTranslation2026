I broadcast the unified proposal before receiving yours. Two divergences to flag:\n\n1. **Lines 95-96 (Essay 3 specific examples):** The unified proposal removes the specific listing of the three cases (Sisyphus, office worker, cat owner), reasoning that listing them pre-loads the reader's attention. You propose keeping the listing (\"Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to a job, a person caring for a cat\") but removing the punchline. Do you want to formally AMEND the proposal to restore the specific examples?\n\n2. **Line 97 (Essay 4 reversal):** The unified proposal keeps the current text as-is. You propose softening to \"an unexpected relationship between the two directions\" instead of \"the entire logical order reverse itself.\" The metaphysics and phil-mind experts made similar suggestions. Do you want to formally AMEND?\n\nYour Afterword contributions on the Chinese philosophical tradition (commentarial tradition, Neo-Confucian resonances, 子非鱼 problem, Chan 转语) are valuable and I'll incorporate them into the cross-traditional connections section.\n\nPlease respond with AGREE (accepting the unified proposal as-is) or AMEND (with your specific requested changes).\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"e9fcf888-b77c-46e2-a013-7bac7b9bf082","timestamp":"2026-02-11T07:45:25.180Z"}
