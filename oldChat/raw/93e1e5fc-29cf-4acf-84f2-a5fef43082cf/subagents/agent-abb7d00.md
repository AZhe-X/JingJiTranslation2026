*STV: Foreword and/or Translator's Preface*

NEW VOTE (replaces previous): Front matter structure for the English edition.

The author may write a Preface later — that's separate. For now, we're deciding about the Foreword and Translator's Preface.

Three options:
A. **Foreword only** (written by an outside scholar/figure)
B. **Foreword + Translator's Preface** (both)
C. **Translator's Preface only** (no foreword)

SINGLE TRANSFERABLE VOTE. Rank all three:

"1st: [A/B/C] — 2nd: [A/B/C] — 3rd: [A/B/C] — Reason: [brief justification]"
