*Check 境界 occurrences in source texts — traditional or technical?*

Follow-up question from the author on 境界: Since 境界 also contains 境, we need to check whether the -scape link should apply here too, or whether 境界 is used in its traditional sense (boundary/realm/level of attainment).

Could you check where 境界 actually appears in the original essays and assess: is the author using 境界 in a way that connects to the technical concept 境, or in its traditional/conventional sense? Does the 境 inside 境界 matter the same way the 境 inside 梦境 matters?

The source texts are at:

/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/22 随笔/

Please check the actual occurrences and give your assessment. Brief responses welcome.

Sent my assessment. The key finding is that 境界 in these texts means "the boundary/horizon of a 境" -- the author even switches from 境界 to bare 境 mid-sentence on line 25, making the connection explicit. I recommend translating 境界 as "horizon" (echoing Husserl's and Gadamer's philosophical use of "horizon" as the limit of what is accessible from a standpoint), with the Jing connection maintained through context rather than forced compounding. Standing by.
