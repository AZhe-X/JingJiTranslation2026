*Note Ivanhoe's DDJ Ch.38 translation for reference*

The author found Ivanhoe's exact translation of 故失道而后德，失德而后仁，失仁而后义，失义而后礼 (DDJ Ch. 38). Please add this to your Memo as a reference in case we want to cite it:

**Philip J. Ivanhoe's rendering:**
"And so,
When the Way was lost there was Virtue;
When Virtue was lost there was benevolence;
When benevolence was lost there was righteousness;
When righteousness was lost there were the rites."

Source: Philip J. Ivanhoe, *The Daodejing of Laozi* (Hackett Classics, 2002), Chapter 38.

Note Ivanhoe's vocabulary:
- 道 → the Way
- 德 → Virtue (capitalized)
- 仁 → benevolence
- 义 → righteousness
- 礼 → the rites

This may be used as the attributed block quote if we go with a standard translation for the Laozi citation. Add it to your Memo under a new section for reference translations.
