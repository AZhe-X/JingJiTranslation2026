*Vote: draft Translator's Preface now or after?*

The author asks: should the translator write a draft of the Translator's Preface NOW (before full translation begins) to capture all the decisions while they're fresh — with the understanding it will be revised after translation is complete? Or should we wait until after?

Reply "NOW" or "AFTER" with a brief reason.

The translator's memo and my memo together already contain everything the Preface needs — the title decision, the glossary rationale, the register strategy, the 7 resolved expert questions, the structural principles, the crescendo insight. If we wait until after translation, half of this will be buried in files no one re-reads, and the Preface will be written from faded memory rather than live understanding. Write the skeleton now while the reasoning is sharp. Revise after translation when we know what actually worked and what had to be adjusted.",
