  "type": "message",
  "recipient": "team-lead",
  "content": "The essays themselves are designed as philosophical experiments that construct the reader's understanding from within -- the author walks readers from concrete examples (collective interest, knowledge, cat-raising) into the formal framework, exactly as classical Chinese philosophical texts do (Mencius's child-at-the-well, Zhuangzi's parables). An external introduction would pre-digest what the author deliberately asks the reader to experience firsthand, potentially undermining the experiential arc that is load-bearing in these essays.",
  "summary": "Reason: external intro would undermine experiential arc"
