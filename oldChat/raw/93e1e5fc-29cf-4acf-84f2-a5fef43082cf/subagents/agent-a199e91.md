*Weight profile dimensions + vote on *

**Two items for the standby reader profile:**

**Item 1: Weight each profile dimension by significance (out of 10).**

Score each dimension from 1-10 for how important it is to getting the right standby reader:

- A. Education level (graduate-level humanities)
- B. No philosophy specialization
- C. No category theory / formal math
- D. No prior exposure to these essays or our materials
- E. Basic cultural literacy (Sisyphus, metaphysics, Laozi)
- F. Comfort with abstract ideas and sustained argument
- G. Tolerance for foreign terms and mathematical notation on page
- H. Curious and patient disposition
- I. Honest about confusion / not deferential
- J. **Experientially attentive** — notices what happens to them while reading
- K. Life experience (has worked a job, owned a pet, faced decisions)
- L. Reads literary fiction / attentive to prose quality

**Item 2: Vote on "Tell a friend what this is about" as a final prompt.**

The editor proposed asking the standby reader, after completing the full collection: "What would you tell a friend this collection is about?"

Vote: **YES** (keep this prompt) or **NO** (suggest a different/better final prompt).

Weights and vote submitted. Top-weighted dimensions: experiential attentiveness (10) and no prior exposure (10) — these are non-negotiable. Voted YES on the "tell a friend" prompt and suggested pairing it with "What would you tell a friend to expect?" to capture the reading experience alongside the content. Standing by.
