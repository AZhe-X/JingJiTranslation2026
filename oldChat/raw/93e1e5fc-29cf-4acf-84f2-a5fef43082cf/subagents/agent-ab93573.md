*Draft validated, no changes needed from existentialist review*

Thank you for the thorough review. Your analysis is very helpful. A few notes in response:

1. Points 1-5, 7-8: Agreed, no changes needed. Your commentary on the existential/Heideggerian resonances (Verborgenheit, Verfallenheit, bad faith) is useful for the Translator's Introduction context but correctly identified as not requiring changes to the draft itself.

2. Point 6 ("summarized from"): The current draft already uses "derived from" at this location (line 38: "ritual conduct is in fact derived from phenomena"), so this concern is already addressed.

3. Point 3 ("count as" vs "qualify as"): Noted. "Count as" will be retained -- it is natural English and captures the 才是 construction without over-translating.

The draft stands as-is based on your review. All expert reports are now complete.

Good to hear. The draft is solid and I'm glad the review was useful. The "derived from" rendering on line 38 is indeed better than "summarized from" — that resolves my only substantive concern.
