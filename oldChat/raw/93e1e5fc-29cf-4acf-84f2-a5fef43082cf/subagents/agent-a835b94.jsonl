The Preface edits are clean, the Afterword blueprint is comprehensive, and my domain-specific contributions (eta model, tower/meta-cognition, neurophenomenology, intersubjectivity via shared eta-structure) are properly placed under a dedicated Philosophy of Mind subsection in Section B. The closing gesture — returning the reader to their own experience — is exactly right for a work whose method is phenomenological.
