Three tasks have been created:\n\n**Task #29 (immediate): Revise Essay 4 Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li passage per editorial flags.**\nThe editor reviewed the draft and identified 3 priority flags and 3 minor flags. The full review is at:\n`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Editor/Review-Essay4-DaoDeRenYiLi.md`\n\nPriority items:\n1. Use em dashes instead of parentheses in line 38's culminating sentence for breathing room\n2. Consider splitting the 46-word subordinate clause in line 42 at \"because\" — the key claim about self/other experience is buried\n3. Fix emphasis on line 44: \"**what a *person* is**\" (bold + italic on \"person\")\n\nMinor items (your judgment): awkward \"run from first to last\" phrasing, flat-landing \"it is the phenomenal,\" \"is said to be\" vs \"means\" in footnote 3.\n\n**Task #30 (next): Draft full Essay 3 translation (Sisyphus, Work, and Cats).**\nThis is the highest-priority new essay because its experiential sequence (Sisyphus -> office worker -> cat) is the most critical to test with the standby reader. See your memo and the editor's memo for detailed requirements. Output to `Draft/Essay3-SisyphusWorkCats.md`.\n\n**Task #31 (after #30): Draft full Essay 1 translation (Collective Interest).**\n\nThe overall translation sequence will be: finish Essay 4 passage revision -> Essay 3 -> Essay 1 -> complete remaining Essay 4 -> Essay 5 -> Essays 6-7 -> Essay 2 apparatus -> Essay 8.\n\nPlease start with Task #29 now.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"644c6845-68ec-49d8-8389-a7cad774e85a","timestamp":"2026-02-11T09:00:08.106Z"}
