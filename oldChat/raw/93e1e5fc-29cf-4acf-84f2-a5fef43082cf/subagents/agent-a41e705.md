*Prior paragraph already explains 形而上 — still need inline?*

New context: the author points out that BEFORE the 道德仁义礼 passage, there is already a paragraph that explicitly explains the 形/形而上/上 structure:

"前形而上学有一个形式上的错误理解，既是对'上'的理解。形而上学的英文，'metaphysics'，字面上来看，既是元物理。倘若把物理理解为现象，那么形而上学所描述的，既是产生现象的原因。然而事实上...形而上学事实上是自现象而产生的。所谓'上'，应当是我们基于现象之上而有的一套理解，而非自上而下由形而上生成了形。"

This paragraph already:
- Explains that "metaphysics" literally means 元物理 (meta-physics)
- Reinterprets 上 (above) as "built upon phenomena" not "generating phenomena from above"
- Explicitly says the direction is wrong: 形而上 should mean "constructed upon 形," not "generating 形 from above"

Given that the reader will have ALREADY read this explanation before encountering the 道德仁义礼 sentence ("the Way is 形而上, ritual conduct is 形"), is the inline "above-the-phenomenal" still needed? Or is a TN sufficient — since the author's own text already does the explanatory work?

Reconsider. Brief response.

The author's own preceding paragraph already does the heavy lifting: it unpacks the 形/形而上 structure, critiques the directionality, and reinterprets 上. By the time the reader reaches the 道德仁义礼 sentence, they have the tools to see what 形而上 means.\n\nUse \"metaphysical\" in the running text (it is the conventional English term and the reader now knows what it conceals), with a brief TN that cross-references the earlier explanation: something like \"See the discussion above of 形而上 (metaphysical) as 'upon the phenomenal' rather than 'above the phenomenal.'\" That is enough to re-activate what the reader already learned.\n\nThe inline coinage was a solution to a probl
