*Should we TN 境界 as *

Quick question from the author on 境界:

We agreed 境界 → "bounds" / "horizon" with a footnote at line 25 (where 境界 and bare 境 appear side by side, the "conceptual birth" moment).

**New proposal:** Should we ALSO add a brief translator's note at the FIRST appearance of 境界 (line 17: "在语言的*境界*（界限）内") noting that 境界 literally = "boundary (界) of Jing (境)"?

This would give the reader two notes with different jobs:
1. **Line 17 (first occurrence):** brief TN — "境界 = boundary of Jing" (etymological primer)
2. **Line 25 (境界 and 境 side by side):** deeper footnote — the moment 境 separates from 境界

Or is one note at line 25 sufficient? Does front-loading the 境-connection at line 17 help or overburden the reader? Keep your response concise — yes/no with brief reasoning.

This creates cognitive noise: the reader would need to hold an unexplained term (\"Jing\") in suspension while reading a passage that is already doing substantial philosophical work (the argument about internal vs. external, the language-boundary analogy).\n\nThe author's own text introduces the technical 境 *later*, and the line 25 moment is where the transition n

No to line 17. One note at line 25 is sufficient -- front-loading a reference to "Jing" before the reader has encountered the concept would create cognitive noise and spoil the conceptual birth moment that the author designed. The line 25 note can do both jobs (etymological primer + emergence narrative) in a single, well-timed intervention. Standing by.
