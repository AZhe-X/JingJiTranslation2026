My original feedback stands -- the questions are well-calibrated to the essays' experiential payloads. A few refinements after this review:\n\n**Essay 2 clarification:** The Bob examples are actually an Alice-and-Bob scenario (Alice tells Bob \"it's raining outside\"), presented in three variants with escalating epistemic complexity. My proposed question (\"Did the repetition help or feel redundant?\") correctly targets whether this three-step progression functions as deepening or mere repetition, but the reader will encounter these as the \"Alice and Bob\" examples, not just \"Bob and the rain.\" The question wording is fine as-is since we are asking about the reader's experience, not naming the specific structure.\n\n**Essay 3 confirmation:** On re-reading, I'm confident that asking \"Of the three examples, which affected you most?\" is safe. The essay explicitly presents three distinct cases (Sisyphus, the office worker, the cat owner) and the reader will naturally register them as three examples. Saying \"three\" does not prime the reader to expect a progression -- it merely acknowledges what they just read. The key data is which one they name and why.\n\n**Essay 7 meme sentence note:** The Chinese internet meme (\"你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国，记住我给出的原理\") will be replaced with an English equivalent in translation per our Q5 resolution. The Critical Experiential Check for Essay 7 asks about \"the two contrasting sentences.\" My per-essay question for Essay 7 targets a different experiential moment (the understanding/mastery distinction), which is correct -- we want both data points but from different stages of the protocol.\n\n**Appendix note for translation team (not for protocol):** The Appendix includes two meme images (`pink-and-forks.jpg` and `constructed-in-my-head.jpg`). These will need translator's notes or replacement in the English edition. Flagging this now for when we reach that stage.\n\n**No changes needed to my original four recommendations.** They hold up after source verification.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"de5b1b80-7731-42de-ad93-3685a87d6f69","timestamp":"2026-02-11T09:20:10.297Z"}
