We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by practice. The author thinks from within the Chinese philosophical tradition -- drawing on the *Laozi*, the *Yijing*, and the Confucian vocabulary of 仁, 义, 礼, and 德 -- while subjecting that tradition to a radical constructivist reinterpretation. This dual formation -- Chinese philosophical inheritance and scientific training -- is not incidental to the text. Physics concepts recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of confronting the absurd through increasingly familiar examples. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 examine, respectively, collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity -- each through a distinctive philosophical method the author does not yet name. The four essays of Part 2 develop the formal framework behind that method: the concepts of the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and a categorical formalism for the structure of experience. The relationship between the two parts is itself part of the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2, and three translator's footnotes within it connect its key terms to the formal apparatus of Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Terminology\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary, and the full rationale for each translation choice is provided in the Introduction to the Glossary at the end of this volume. Three points deserve advance mention here. First, the author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (\"the metaphysical\" -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (\"metaphysics\" -- the discipline that studies such constructions); we render these distinctly throughout. Second, two key concepts -- the Poetic (诗意, *shiyi*), the author's term for lucid engagement with meaning-structures, and the non-rational (非理性), the acknowledged ground of all rational activity -- are central to the collection's argument and may surprise readers expecting standard philosophical usage. Third, the reader will encounter two different English words for the same Chinese character within a single passage: 德 appears as \"virtue\" when quoting Laozi and as \"character\" when the author analyzes the concept. This is deliberate -- it reflects the author's argument that the traditional reading conceals the constructive process the essay exposes. The Glossary Introduction explains this and all other terminological decisions in full.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it. This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order, progressing from the mythic to the mundane. The progression itself is the philosophical payload: by the final example, the reader is invited to test the essay's claim against their own experience. The recognition that follows -- which cannot be produced by argument alone -- is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter. This is not a stylistic preference but a philosophical necessity: if the reader's experience is the evidence for the author's claims, then a translation that preserves the words but fails to produce the experience has lost the argument. In these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation. Terminological decisions are discussed in full in the Introduction to the Glossary.*\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":45,"oldLines":10,"newStart":45,"newLines":8,"lines":[" "," This is not merely an organizing metaphor.

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by practice. The author thinks from within the Chinese philosophical tradition -- drawing on the *Laozi*, the *Yijing*, and the Confucian vocabulary of 仁, 义, 礼, and 德 -- while subjecting that tradition to a radical constructivist reinterpretation. This dual formation -- Chinese philosophical inheritance and scientific training -- is not incidental to the text. Physics concepts recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of confronting the absurd through increasingly familiar examples. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last. The relationship between the two parts is itself part of the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2, and three translator's footnotes within it connect its key terms to the formal apparatus of Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Terminology\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary, and the full rationale for each translation choice is provided in the Introduction to the Glossary at the end of this volume. Three points deserve advance mention here. First, the author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (\"the metaphysical\" -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (\"metaphysics\" -- the discipline that studies such constructions); we render these distinctly throughout. Second, two key concepts -- the Poetic (诗意, *shiyi*), the author's term for lucid engagement with meaning-structures, and the non-rational (非理性), the acknowledged ground of all rational activity -- are central to the collection's argument and may surprise readers expecting standard philosophical usage. Third, the reader will encounter two different English words for the same Chinese character within a single passage: 德 appears as \"virtue\" when quoting Laozi and as \"character\" when the author analyzes the concept. This is deliberate -- it reflects the author's argument that the traditional reading conceals the constructive process the essay exposes. The Glossary Introduction explains this and all other terminological decisions in full.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it. This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order, progressing from the mythic to the mundane. The progression itself is the philosophical payload: by the final example, the reader is invited to test the essay's claim against their own experience. The recognition that follows -- which cannot be produced by argument alone -- is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter. This is not a stylistic preference but a philosophical necessity: if the reader's experience is the evidence for the author's claims, then a translation that preserves the words but fails to produce the experience has lost the argument. In these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation. Terminological decisions are discussed in full in the Introduction to the Glossary.*\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":2,"oldLines":7,"newStart":2,"newLines":7,"lines":[" essay: Translator's Preface"," status: DRAFT-R3 (spoiler resolution per team consensus)"," date: 2026-02-11","-note: R3 resolves spoilers: structural claims paragraph (line 50) replaced with topic-only text; Essay 3 punchline and case listing removed from Experiential Sequences section; \"dissolve in the presence of a cat\" softened in Fish/Fishing section.
