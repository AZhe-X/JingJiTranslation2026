*Suggest Editor agent profile requirements*

We're creating an Editor agent for the team. What should their profile look like?

From your field's perspective, list the key skills, qualities, and responsibilities this Editor should have. Think about:
- What prose-level issues from your domain would they need to catch?
- What register/style sensitivities are essential?
- What should they NOT do (i.e., boundaries between Editor and expert/translator roles)?

Be concise — bullet points preferred.

Submitted my recommendations for the Editor agent profile. The key points from the existentialism perspective:

- The Editor needs sensitivity to affective weight and deliberate ambiguity in philosophical prose
- Must preserve the author's argumentative architecture (especially the multi-layered reversals) while improving readability
- Should manage the balance between analytical and lyrical registers
- Clear boundary: terminological choices, philosophical ambiguity resolution, and Translator's Notes are expert/translator territory, not the Editor's

Waiting for further instructions from the team lead.
