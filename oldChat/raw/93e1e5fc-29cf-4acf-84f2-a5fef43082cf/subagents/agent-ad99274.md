*DRAFT-R1 verified and approved, no further flags*

DRAFT-R1 verified. All four accepted changes confirmed in the file. Both declined flags have sound rationale — I agree with your reasoning on both.

The passage reads well now. The em dashes in line 38 give the dense phenomenal-X accumulation proper breathing room without breaking the argumentative chain. The sentence split in line 42 is the most significant improvement — the self/other gap claim now lands with the weight it deserves.

From my editorial perspective, this passage is ready for final review. No further flags from me.
