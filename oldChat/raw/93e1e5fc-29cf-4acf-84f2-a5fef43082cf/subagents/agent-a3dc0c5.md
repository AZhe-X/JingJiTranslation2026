I can see the draft has been revised since my earlier review. Let me verify the key changes against the original Chinese and send my final sign-off.

  "content": "**CONFIRM**\n\nI have re-read the revised draft. From a metaphysics standpoint, the draft is approved. Specific confirmations:\n\n- \"a feeling directed toward the other\" (line 38) -- my earlier concern is resolved.\n- \"meta-physics (元物理)\" now appears inline (line 36), with TN2 updated to reference the author's own preceding paragraph. This addresses my optional suggestion adequately.\n- The seven-step reversal argument is intact and accurate.\n- The property -> definition -> character -> Way chain is faithfully rendered.\n- The 失 echo between the Laozi quote and line 46 (\"entirely **lost**\") is preserved.\n- \"regularity\" for 规律 (lines 40, 44) is an improvement over the earlier \"pattern\" -- it better captures the law

**CONFIRM** sent to team-lead. The revised draft is approved from the metaphysics perspective. All earlier concerns have been addressed, and I noted several improvements in this revision (the inline 元物理, "regularity" for 规律, the refined footnote [^24] wording, and the expanded TN3). No objections.
