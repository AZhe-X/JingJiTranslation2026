*Supplementary protocol feedback after re-reading all essays*

**Supplementary feedback on Reporting-Protocol.md (from existentialism-expert) -- after re-reading all source essays**

I have now re-read all 8+1 essays and my own analysis report. My earlier feedback stands, but I want to refine and add several points that became clearer with the source material fresh.

---

**1. Refinement to my Essay 7 (K1 Strategy) question.**

I previously proposed: "Was there a sentence in this essay that you couldn't make sense of at all?"

Having re-read K1, I want to flag that this essay has *many* passages a non-mathematical reader may struggle with (the functor definitions, the commutative diagrams, the formal derivations). The meme sentence is designed to be incomprehensible in a specific way -- grammatically plausible but semantically void -- which is structurally different from "I don't understand the math." A general "what couldn't you understand?" question will likely elicit reports about the mathematical formalism rather than about the meme.

**Revised proposal for Essay 7 Stage 2 follow-up:** "Were there parts you didn't understand because they were too technical, and parts you didn't understand for a different reason? Can you distinguish them?"

This separates the two kinds of incomprehension without pointing at the meme. If the reader says "yes, the math was hard, but there was also this one sentence that was just... weird," we know the meme replacement worked. If they lump everything together as "too technical," we know it didn't.

**2. New observation about Essay 1 (Collective Interest).**

Re-reading Essay 1, I notice it ends with a striking structural move: the essay begins by questioning whether collective interest exists, establishes that it does (via renormalization), and then in the final paragraph pivots to say that "abstract concepts themselves" may be understood as renormalized -- including "individual interest." The essay's concluding gesture is to reflexively dissolve its own starting distinction. This is a subtle but load-bearing experiential move.

**Proposed Essay 1 Stage 2 follow-up** (replacing or supplementing my earlier physics question): "Did the essay change your mind about anything, or did it confirm what you already thought?"

If the reader says "it confirmed that collective interest is real" -- they got the middle but missed the ending twist. If they say "it made me realize even individual interest is an abstraction" -- the full arc landed.

---

**3. New observation about Essay 5 (The Poetic).**

Re-reading the essay, the game example (RPG and sandbox game) at the beginning of the 梦境 section is actually the reader's first introduction to the concept. The game is the anchor example, and the intoxicated/lucid distinction is built upon it. The coin-flip comes later (in the Appendix). So the question of whether the reader grasps 诗意 experientially will partly depend on whether the game example works.

**Refined Essay 5 Stage 2 follow-up:** "Could you give an example from your own life of what this essay calls 'the poetic'?"

This is better than my earlier "could you describe the poetic in your own words?" because it forces the reader to translate the concept into their own experience rather than just paraphrase the text. If they can produce a personal example (even one the author didn't use), the concept has been transmitted. If they can only repeat the essay's examples back, it remains abstract.

---

**4. Observation about the Appendix's experiential character.**

Re-reading the Appendix (关于诗意和境的一些零散想法), I notice it is significantly more fragmentary and draft-like than the other essays. It includes incomplete sections (the 两种困惑 section breaks off mid-sentence), meme images, and notes that read like conversation summaries ("在和朋友的讨论中..."). This is very different in texture from Essays 1-7.

The standby reader will likely have a reaction to this change in quality/completeness. We should be prepared for reports like "this felt unfinished" or "this was different from the others." These are not failures of translation -- they are features of the source text. But the reader's response will tell us whether the Appendix works as a closing frame despite its fragmentary quality.

My earlier Appendix question ("Did this feel like an ending? Like a beginning? Like something else?") remains the right question. But I want to flag for the team: the Appendix's near-lyrical passage about being "poets of our own lives" (in the 关于范畴论 section) is the emotional and philosophical climax of the entire collection. If the reader reaches it, their response to it is perhaps the most important single data point we will collect. If the draft quality of the surrounding material prevents the reader from reaching it with full engagement, that is critical feedback about whether the Appendix needs more editorial work before the climax can land.

---

**5. Critical Experiential Check addition: Essay 5.**

I now feel more confident that we need a Critical Experiential Check for Essay 5. Re-reading it, the essay's core move is: you cannot abandon all dreamscapes because "I as an already-existing I necessarily have feelings that belong to me as me" (我作为已然存在的我必然有着作为我的感受). This is the philosophical hinge: it establishes that nihilism-as-practice is impossible because feeling precedes the concept of self. Whether the reader experiences this as a genuine insight (felt impossibility of total disengagement) or just as an assertion (the author says we can't abandon meaning) is a critical diagnostic.

**Proposed Essay 5 Critical Experiential Check:** "When the essay argued you cannot reject all meaning -- did that feel like something you already knew, something new, or something you're not sure about?"

This is non-leading because it offers three options without privileging any of them. The reader's choice tells us whether the argument landed experientially (felt recognition of something already implicitly known), intellectually (new proposition accepted), or not at all (uncertainty).

---

**Summary of additions:**
1. Revised Essay 7 follow-up to distinguish math-incomprehension from meme-incomprehension
2. New Essay 1 follow-up testing whether the reflexive ending twist landed
3. Refined Essay 5 follow-up requesting a personal example of "the poetic"
4. Flag about the Appendix's fragmentary quality and the climactic passage's vulnerability
5. New Critical Experiential Check for Essay 5 on the impossibility of total disengagement
