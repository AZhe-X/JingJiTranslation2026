*Debate *

The author is considering "character" for 德. Those who voted against it — what is your single strongest objection to "character"? Those who voted for it — what is its single strongest advantage?

Also: we now know 性 does NOT appear as a standalone technical term in the collection, so the "nature" collision concern is off the table.

Brief responses — one strongest point each.

When the reader encounters \"all things have their character,\" the most natural English reading is personality or temperament -- a descriptive property that a thing *happens to have*. But the author's 德 is constitutive -- what *makes* a thing what it is. \"Character\" does not carry that constitutive force without a modifier. \"Defining character\" or \"constitutive nature\" both fix this; bare \"character\" does not.\n"

Bare "character" reads as descriptive (what a thing happens to be like) rather than constitutive (what makes a thing what it is). Needs a modifier. Standing by.
