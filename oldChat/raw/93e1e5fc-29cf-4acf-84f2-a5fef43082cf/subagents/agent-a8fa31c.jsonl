Strong points on all the epistemological architecture -- glad the inference/explanation/application distinction, the property-to-definition reversal, and the generation chain all came through clearly. Here are the edits I made:\n\n1. **\"summarized from\" → \"derived from\"** (concern 2) -- agreed, 总结 is an epistemic extraction operation, not condensation. \"Derived from\" is clean.\n\n2. **\"inductively generalized\" → \"inductively derived property\"** (concern 4) -- agreed, avoids the tautological doubling.\n\n3. **\"issues in\" → \"one practices\"** (concern 5) -- fixed in both occurrences (line 42 and line 46). 行 is active/agentive and \"issues in\" was too passive.\n\n4. **Standardized \"arising from the heart\"** (concern 7) -- all three occurrences of 发乎于心 now consistently use \"the heart\" rather than mixing \"from within me\" and \"from within the heart.\"\n\n**Not adopted:** The TN3 addition (\"a status arrived at through induction rather than given a priori\"). The existing phrasing \"assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down\" already captures the epistemic operation in the author's own idiom. Adding \"a priori\" would import Kantian terminology that could mislead -- the author's framework is not specifically anti-Kantian here, just constructivist.\n\n**On concern 8 (生成 consistency):** Confirmed -- \"generate/generated\" is used consistently throughout. I will not vary it for style.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"95741d94-01f3-4068-8f2a-a43f1e59e475","timestamp":"2026-02-11T03:27:33.961Z"}
