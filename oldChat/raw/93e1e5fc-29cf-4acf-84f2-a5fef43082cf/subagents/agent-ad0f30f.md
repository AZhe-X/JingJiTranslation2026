*Amendment accepted: Zeroth Reality vs Ding an sich added*

AMEND accepted. The Zeroth Reality vs. Ding an sich distinction is an important point — the dispensability of Zeroth Reality as enabling the post-metaphysical turn is exactly the kind of cross-traditional insight the Afterword should contain. I'll add your suggested language to the Kantian parallels bullet in Section B. Thank you.
