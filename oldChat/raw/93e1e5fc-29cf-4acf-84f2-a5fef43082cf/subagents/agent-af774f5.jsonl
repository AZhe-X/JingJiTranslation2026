Here is the complete compiled synthesis:\n\n---\n\n## Overall Verdict\n**Unanimous: Excellent draft.** All 10 rate it highly. No one calls for structural revision. The \"Experiential Sequences\" section is singled out as the strongest by all 10. \"The experience IS the argument\" praised unanimously.\n\n---\n\n## MUST FIX (unanimous or near-unanimous)\n\n**1. Line 97 — Husserl/Kant *Erscheinung* confusion**\nFlagged by: ALL 10 reviewers.\nProblem: \"closer to Husserl's *Erscheinung* or *Phanomen* than to Kant's *Erscheinung*\" uses the same German word on both sides and conflates two distinct Husserlian concepts.\nConsensus: Simplify. Drop the German terms entirely, or use only *Phanomen* for Husserl. Kantian-expert suggests: \"The author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry — phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not 'mere' appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs.\"\n\n**2. Line 143 — 体验 glossed as \"lived experience\"**\nFlagged by: Wittgenstein, Buddhism.\nProblem: The Translation Dictionary explicitly says \"AVOID 'lived experience' (too Husserlian — imports *Erlebnis*).\" The preface contradicts the Dictionary.\nFix: Change to \"experience\" in the processual/immersive sense, with optional scholarly note.\n\n---\n\n## SHOULD FIX (strong consensus, 4+ reviewers)\n\n**3. The Poetic section (lines 107-111) — Heidegger order + concreteness**\nFlagged by: Wittgenstein, Existentialism, Kantian, Phil-Mind, Editor.\nIssues: (a) Heidegger comparison comes first, dominating the reader's framing — the author's independent path should come first, Heidegger second. (b) Multiple reviewers want one concrete example (coin-flip or game analogy) to make the Poetic evocable, not just definable. Editor flags this as R7 (experiential flatness).\n\n**4. 形而上 vs 形而上学 parenthetical (line 93)**\nFlagged by: Metaphysics-expert.\nIssue: \"(claiming those structures are the ultimate nature of reality)\" describes pre-metaphysics, not metaphysics in general. More precisely: \"one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline).\"\n\n**5. 恒常 \"not what we find\" slightly overstated (line 101)**\nFlagged by: Metaphysics-expert.\nIssue: Author acknowledges we *do* find stable structures provisionally. Suggest: \"what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena — patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\"\n\n---\n\n## RECOMMENDED ADDITIONS (3+ reviewers or domain-critical)\n\n**6. 属性→定义 reversal mechanism** — Chinese-phil: \"the most original philosophical move in the entire collection.\" One sentence would prime the reader's recognition.\n\n**7. Author situated within Chinese tradition** — Chinese-phil: \"The author thinks from within the Chinese philosophical tradition — drawing on the Laozi, the Yijing, and the Confucian vocabulary — while subjecting that tradition to a radical constructivist reinterpretation.\" Currently invisible to English readers.\n\n**8. Chinese philosophical experiment precedent** — Chinese-phil: Mencius 孺子入井, Zhuangzi parables as precedents for the experiential method. One sentence.\n\n**9. The absurd and its dissolution** — Existentialism: Missing entirely. The author treats the absurd as structural Jing-collapse (not permanent condition à la Camus), addressable through Jing-reconstruction. A genuine contribution deserving mention.\n\n**10. Nihilism as consequence of metaphysics** — Existentialism: \"The collection's most important structural claim from an existentialist perspective\" — nihilism is not the negation of metaphysics but its *consequence*. A sentence or two.\n\n**11. Diamond Sutra caveat** — Phil-mind, Buddhism: Author doesn't commit to Madhyamaka ontology. Soften \"not grounded in inherent existence\" — the author's position is epistemological agnosticism, not a positive claim about lacking inherent nature.\n\n**12. Stable structures (稳定结构)** — Phenomenology: Missing from terminology. Brief mention needed — \"patterns that persist as a Jing evolves over time; the author's empirical replacement for a priori categories.\"\n\n**13. Natural transformations / eta** — Wittgenstein: The collection's \"most significant innovation\" per all 9 experts. A brief paragraph in terminology explaining that the author formalizes \"understanding\" as a natural transformation.\n\n**14. 仁/义/礼 departure rationale** — Chinese-phil: Explain *why* we depart from common translations, not just *that* we depart. E.g., \"humaneness\" over \"benevolence\" captures inner felt experience over outward action; \"rightness\" over \"righteousness\" avoids moralistic/absolutist overtones.\n\n**15. Zeroth Reality vs Ding an sich** — Kantian: Decisive difference — for Kant, Ding an sich is a necessary limiting concept; for the author, Zeroth Reality is genuinely dispensable. Worth a clause.\n\n**16. 非和谐 is the author's own English coinage** — Metaphysics: Note it's not a translator's choice.\n\n**17. \"Coins\" → \"uses\" for 虚妄** — Editor: The author didn't coin 虚妄, they use it personally. Change \"coins\" to \"uses.\"\n\n---\n\n## EDITORIAL FLAGS (from editor)\n\n- **Poetic section**: slightly dry — add one concrete example (priority flag)\n- **\"knowledge sub-category\" (line 60)**: not yet introduced at that point — simplify to \"foreshadows the formal treatment of knowledge in Part 2\"\n- **德 split dual rendering**: make explicit that the reader will see two different English words for the same Chinese character within the same passage\n- **\"Other Terms\" paragraph**: dense — consider sub-sections or note pointing to full glossary\n\n---\n\n## ADDITIONAL SUGGESTIONS (optional, from individual experts)\n\n- Wittgensteinian affinity of the experiential method — one sentence noting recognized philosophical method (Wittgenstein, optional)\n- Kierkegaard/Sartre/Camus precedents for experiential sequences, but author's version is *systematized* within formal framework (Existentialism, optional)\n- \"Physics metaphors\" → \"physics analogies\" or \"physics concepts\" — \"metaphor\" undercuts the structural point (Phenomenology, minor)\n- \"Vocation\" for the author may carry metaphysical overtones — consider \"practice\" or \"inclination\" (Phil-mind, minor)\n- Experiential fidelity rationale: explain WHY it trumps literal accuracy — the reader's experience is the evidence (Phil-mind)\n- \"Dreamscape\" is not just metaphor but structurally determinative of what can appear within it (Phenomenology)\n- Other-minds dimension of Essay 4 — the projection from first-person to third-person (Phil-mind)\n- Author's self-aware meta-commentary — the framework analyzes itself (Metaphysics)\n\n---\n\n## PRAISED UNANIMOUSLY (no changes needed)\n\n- \"The experience IS the argument\"\n- Non-Rational (非理性) explanation\n- Fish/Fishing structure explanation\n- 形 reinterpretation section\n- 德 split convention explanation\n- Meme replacement rationale\n- Working-draft quality justification\n- Reading guidance section\n- 虚妄 disambiguation from Buddhist mrsa\n\n---\n\nPlease review and let team-lead know how you'd like to proceed with revisions.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"6cf4ba84-5b0e-4f61-8c1c-e9c0a539b5d5","timestamp":"2026-02-11T06:28:13.871Z"}

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n    15→\n    16→集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n    17→\n    18→No single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n    19→\n    20→The author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n    21→\n    22→We treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n    23→\n    24→The \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n    25→\n    26→---\n    27→\n    28→## The Author\n    29→\n    30→The author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by vocation. This dual formation is not incidental to the text. Physics metaphors recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n    31→\n    32→The author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n    33→\n    34→The collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n    35→\n    36→---\n    37→\n    38→## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n    39→\n    40→The collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n    41→\n    42→- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n    43→- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n    44→- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n    45→\n    46→The division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n    47→\n    48→This is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n    49→\n    50→We recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n    51→\n    52→---\n    53→\n    54→## A Bilingual Collection\n    55→\n    56→One of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n    57→\n    58→We have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n    59→\n    60→We have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n    61→\n    62→---\n    63→\n    64→## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n    65→\n    66→A note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n    67→\n    68→The Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n    69→\n    70→> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n    71→> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n    72→\n    73→In its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n    74→\n    75→The author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n    76→\n    77→This reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n    78→\n    79→A footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n    80→\n    81→---\n    82→\n    83→## Key Terminological Decisions\n    84→\n    85→These essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n    86→\n    87→### Jing (境) and E\n    88→\n    89→As discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n    90→\n    91→### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n    92→\n    93→The author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing meaning-structures) without doing metaphysics (claiming those structures are the ultimate nature of reality). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n    94→\n    95→### Phenomena (现象)\n    96→\n    97→The author uses 现象 with phenomenological weight closer to Husserl's *Erscheinung* or *Phanomen* than to Kant's *Erscheinung*. Phenomena are not \"mere appearances\" behind which a truer reality hides; they are the indubitable starting point, the only reality we have direct access to (First Reality, 第一实在). \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n    98→\n    99→### Constancy (恒常)\n   100→\n   101→The drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we *seek* in phenomena, not what we find.\n   102→\n   103→### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n   104→\n   105→The author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n   106→\n   107→### The Poetic (诗意)\n   108→\n   109→The author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n   110→\n   111→\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. It shares conceptual ground with Heidegger's \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*) but emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n   112→\n   113→### Dreamscape (梦境)\n   114→\n   115→The author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not grounded in inherent existence, functional within its own terms.\n   116→\n   117→### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n   118→\n   119→The author coins 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n   120→\n   121→### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n   122→\n   123→In Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n   124→\n   125→A critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n   126→\n   127→The remaining terms: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" (following Ames and Rosemont), emphasizing the inner feeling over the behavioral expression. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness,\" capturing the motivational disposition rather than the moral judgment that \"righteousness\" implies. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension.\n   128→\n   129→The author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument.\n   130→\n   131→### Three Realities\n   132→\n   133→The author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n   134→\n   135→- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n   136→- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n   137→- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n   138→\n   139→The numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\"\n   140→\n   141→### Other Terms\n   142→\n   143→**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"lived experience\" (the Chinese equivalent of Erlebnis). **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" (the author's coinage, with this English gloss in the original). **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n   144→\n   145→A complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n   146→\n   147→---\n   148→\n   149→## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n   150→\n   151→This collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it.\n   152→\n   153→Three examples, among many:\n   154→\n   155→In Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n   156→\n   157→In Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n   158→\n   159→In Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n   160→\n   161→We have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter -- because in these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n   162→\n   163→---\n   164→\n   165→## A Note on Reading\n   166→\n   167→The author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n   168→\n   169→The three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n   170→\n   171→Readers without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone.

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by vocation. This dual formation is not incidental to the text. Physics metaphors recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\nThe collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing meaning-structures) without doing metaphysics (claiming those structures are the ultimate nature of reality). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 with phenomenological weight closer to Husserl's *Erscheinung* or *Phanomen* than to Kant's *Erscheinung*. Phenomena are not \"mere appearances\" behind which a truer reality hides; they are the indubitable starting point, the only reality we have direct access to (First Reality, 第一实在). \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we *seek* in phenomena, not what we find.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. It shares conceptual ground with Heidegger's \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*) but emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not grounded in inherent existence, functional within its own terms.\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author coins 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" (following Ames and Rosemont), emphasizing the inner feeling over the behavioral expression. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness,\" capturing the motivational disposition rather than the moral judgment that \"righteousness\" implies. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument.\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\"\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"lived experience\" (the Chinese equivalent of Erlebnis). **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" (the author's coinage, with this English gloss in the original). **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter -- because in these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n\n---\n\n## Glossary\n\n*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n","numLines":182,"startLine":1,"totalLines":182}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"79404041-2c71-41c3-89ad-a26ed3ae63fd"}

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by vocation. This dual formation is not incidental to the text. Physics metaphors recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\nThe collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing meaning-structures) without doing metaphysics (claiming those structures are the ultimate nature of reality). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 with phenomenological weight closer to Husserl's *Erscheinung* or *Phanomen* than to Kant's *Erscheinung*. Phenomena are not \"mere appearances\" behind which a truer reality hides; they are the indubitable starting point, the only reality we have direct access to (First Reality, 第一实在). \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we *seek* in phenomena, not what we find.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. It shares conceptual ground with Heidegger's \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*) but emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not grounded in inherent existence, functional within its own terms.\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author coins 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" (following Ames and Rosemont), emphasizing the inner feeling over the behavioral expression. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness,\" capturing the motivational disposition rather than the moral judgment that \"righteousness\" implies. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument.\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\"\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"lived experience\" (the Chinese equivalent of Erlebnis). **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" (the author's coinage, with this English gloss in the original). **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter -- because in these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n\n---\n\n## Glossary\n\n*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":94,"oldLines":7,"newStart":94,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," ### Phenomena (现象)"," ","-The author uses 现象 with phenomenological weight closer to Husserl's *Erscheinung* or *Phanomen* than to Kant's *Erscheinung*.

Specific examples, page references, and fine-grained phrasing will be revised once the full translation exists.\nmodified: 2026-02-10T22:11:27-08:00\ncreated: 2026-02-10T22:11:13-08:00\n---\n\n# Translators-Preface\n\n## On the Title\n\nThe title of this collection is 境集 (*Jing Ji*). We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by vocation. This dual formation is not incidental to the text. Physics metaphors recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\nThe collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing meaning-structures) without doing metaphysics (claiming those structures are the ultimate nature of reality). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we *seek* in phenomena, not what we find.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. It shares conceptual ground with Heidegger's \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*) but emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not grounded in inherent existence, functional within its own terms.\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author coins 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" (following Ames and Rosemont), emphasizing the inner feeling over the behavioral expression. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness,\" capturing the motivational disposition rather than the moral judgment that \"righteousness\" implies. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument.\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\"\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"lived experience\" (the Chinese equivalent of Erlebnis). **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" (the author's coinage, with this English gloss in the original). **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter -- because in these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n\n---\n\n## Glossary\n\n*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":140,"oldLines":7,"newStart":140,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," ### Other Terms"," ","-**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"lived experience\" (the Chinese equivalent of Erlebnis). **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" (the author's coinage, with this English gloss in the original). **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).","+**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" (the author's coinage, with this English gloss in the original). **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological)."," "," A complete glossary follows the translated essays."," "]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"a18b64e5-ef7f-40ab-bdd4-73b557864a94"}

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by vocation. This dual formation is not incidental to the text. Physics metaphors recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\nThe collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing meaning-structures) without doing metaphysics (claiming those structures are the ultimate nature of reality). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we *seek* in phenomena, not what we find.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. It shares conceptual ground with Heidegger's \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*) but emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not grounded in inherent existence, functional within its own terms.\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author coins 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" (following Ames and Rosemont), emphasizing the inner feeling over the behavioral expression. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness,\" capturing the motivational disposition rather than the moral judgment that \"righteousness\" implies. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument.\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\"\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" (the author's coinage, with this English gloss in the original). **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter -- because in these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n\n---\n\n## Glossary\n\n*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":108,"oldLines":8,"newStart":108,"newLines":12,"lines":[" "," The author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally."," ","-\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality.

Specific examples, page references, and fine-grained phrasing will be revised once the full translation exists.\nmodified: 2026-02-10T22:28:56-08:00\ncreated: 2026-02-10T22:11:13-08:00\n---\n\n# Translators-Preface\n\n## On the Title\n\nThe title of this collection is 境集 (*Jing Ji*). We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by vocation. This dual formation is not incidental to the text. Physics metaphors recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\nThe collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing meaning-structures) without doing metaphysics (claiming those structures are the ultimate nature of reality). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we *seek* in phenomena, not what we find.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\nTo make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n\nReaders familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not grounded in inherent existence, functional within its own terms.\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author coins 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" (following Ames and Rosemont), emphasizing the inner feeling over the behavioral expression. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness,\" capturing the motivational disposition rather than the moral judgment that \"righteousness\" implies. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument.\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\"\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" (the author's coinage, with this English gloss in the original). **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter -- because in these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n\n---\n\n## Glossary\n\n*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":90,"oldLines":7,"newStart":90,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," ### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)"," ","-The author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions).

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by vocation. This dual formation is not incidental to the text. Physics metaphors recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\nThe collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we *seek* in phenomena, not what we find.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\nTo make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n\nReaders familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not grounded in inherent existence, functional within its own terms.\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author coins 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" (following Ames and Rosemont), emphasizing the inner feeling over the behavioral expression. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness,\" capturing the motivational disposition rather than the moral judgment that \"righteousness\" implies. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument.\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\"\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" (the author's coinage, with this English gloss in the original). **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter -- because in these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n\n---\n\n## Glossary\n\n*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":98,"oldLines":7,"newStart":98,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," ### Constancy (恒常)"," ","-The drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical).

Specific examples, page references, and fine-grained phrasing will be revised once the full translation exists.\nmodified: 2026-02-10T22:28:56-08:00\ncreated: 2026-02-10T22:11:13-08:00\n---\n\n# Translators-Preface\n\n## On the Title\n\nThe title of this collection is 境集 (*Jing Ji*). We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by vocation. This dual formation is not incidental to the text. Physics metaphors recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\nThe collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\nTo make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n\nReaders familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not grounded in inherent existence, functional within its own terms.\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author coins 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" (following Ames and Rosemont), emphasizing the inner feeling over the behavioral expression. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness,\" capturing the motivational disposition rather than the moral judgment that \"righteousness\" implies. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument.\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\"\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" (the author's coinage, with this English gloss in the original). **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter -- because in these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n\n---\n\n## Glossary\n\n*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":120,"oldLines":7,"newStart":120,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," ### Vain Presumption (虚妄)"," ","-The author coins 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive.

Specific examples, page references, and fine-grained phrasing will be revised once the full translation exists.\nmodified: 2026-02-10T22:28:56-08:00\ncreated: 2026-02-10T22:11:13-08:00\n---\n\n# Translators-Preface\n\n## On the Title\n\nThe title of this collection is 境集 (*Jing Ji*). We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by vocation. This dual formation is not incidental to the text. Physics metaphors recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\nThe collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\nTo make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n\nReaders familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not grounded in inherent existence, functional within its own terms.\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" (following Ames and Rosemont), emphasizing the inner feeling over the behavioral expression. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness,\" capturing the motivational disposition rather than the moral judgment that \"righteousness\" implies. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument.\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\"\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" (the author's coinage, with this English gloss in the original). **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter -- because in these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n\n---\n\n## Glossary\n\n*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":144,"oldLines":7,"newStart":144,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," ### Other Terms"," ","-**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" (the author's coinage, with this English gloss in the original). **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).","+**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; \"the off-tone\" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological)."," "," A complete glossary follows the translated essays."," "]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"07d18d06-0756-4583-b049-b238518b5cbc"}

Specific examples, page references, and fine-grained phrasing will be revised once the full translation exists.\nmodified: 2026-02-10T22:30:06-08:00\ncreated: 2026-02-10T22:11:13-08:00\n---\n\n# Translators-Preface\n\n## On the Title\n\nThe title of this collection is 境集 (*Jing Ji*). We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by vocation. This dual formation is not incidental to the text. Physics metaphors recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\nThe collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\nTo make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n\nReaders familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not grounded in inherent existence, functional within its own terms.\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" (following Ames and Rosemont), emphasizing the inner feeling over the behavioral expression. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness,\" capturing the motivational disposition rather than the moral judgment that \"righteousness\" implies. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument.\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\"\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; \"the off-tone\" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter -- because in these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n\n---\n\n## Glossary\n\n*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":27,"oldLines":7,"newStart":27,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," ## The Author"," ","-The author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by vocation.

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by practice. The author thinks from within the Chinese philosophical tradition -- drawing on the *Laozi*, the *Yijing*, and the Confucian vocabulary of 仁, 义, 礼, and 德 -- while subjecting that tradition to a radical constructivist reinterpretation. This dual formation -- Chinese philosophical inheritance and scientific training -- is not incidental to the text. Physics concepts recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\nThe collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\nTo make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n\nReaders familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not grounded in inherent existence, functional within its own terms.\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" (following Ames and Rosemont), emphasizing the inner feeling over the behavioral expression. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness,\" capturing the motivational disposition rather than the moral judgment that \"righteousness\" implies. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument.\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\"\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; \"the off-tone\" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter -- because in these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n\n---\n\n## Glossary\n\n*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":152,"oldLines":7,"newStart":152,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," ## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments"," ","-This collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them.

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by practice. The author thinks from within the Chinese philosophical tradition -- drawing on the *Laozi*, the *Yijing*, and the Confucian vocabulary of 仁, 义, 礼, and 德 -- while subjecting that tradition to a radical constructivist reinterpretation. This dual formation -- Chinese philosophical inheritance and scientific training -- is not incidental to the text. Physics concepts recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\nThe collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\nTo make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n\nReaders familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not grounded in inherent existence, functional within its own terms.\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" (following Ames and Rosemont), emphasizing the inner feeling over the behavioral expression. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness,\" capturing the motivational disposition rather than the moral judgment that \"righteousness\" implies. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument.\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\"\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; \"the off-tone\" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it. This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter -- because in these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n\n---\n\n## Glossary\n\n*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":162,"oldLines":7,"newStart":162,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," In Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation.

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by practice. The author thinks from within the Chinese philosophical tradition -- drawing on the *Laozi*, the *Yijing*, and the Confucian vocabulary of 仁, 义, 礼, and 德 -- while subjecting that tradition to a radical constructivist reinterpretation. This dual formation -- Chinese philosophical inheritance and scientific training -- is not incidental to the text. Physics concepts recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\nThe collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\nTo make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n\nReaders familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not grounded in inherent existence, functional within its own terms.\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" (following Ames and Rosemont), emphasizing the inner feeling over the behavioral expression. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness,\" capturing the motivational disposition rather than the moral judgment that \"righteousness\" implies. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument.\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\"\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; \"the off-tone\" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it. This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter. This is not a stylistic preference but a philosophical necessity: if the reader's experience is the evidence for the author's claims, then a translation that preserves the words but fails to produce the experience has lost the argument. In these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n\n---\n\n## Glossary\n\n*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":130,"oldLines":8,"newStart":130,"newLines":10,"lines":[" "," The remaining terms: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" (following Ames and Rosemont), emphasizing the inner feeling over the behavioral expression. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness,\" capturing the motivational disposition rather than the moral judgment that \"righteousness\" implies. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension."," ","-The author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached.

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by practice. The author thinks from within the Chinese philosophical tradition -- drawing on the *Laozi*, the *Yijing*, and the Confucian vocabulary of 仁, 义, 礼, and 德 -- while subjecting that tradition to a radical constructivist reinterpretation. This dual formation -- Chinese philosophical inheritance and scientific training -- is not incidental to the text. Physics concepts recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\nThe collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\nTo make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n\nReaders familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not grounded in inherent existence, functional within its own terms.\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" (following Ames and Rosemont), emphasizing the inner feeling over the behavioral expression. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness,\" capturing the motivational disposition rather than the moral judgment that \"righteousness\" implies. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument. Readers should watch for the moment when the author shows how an inductively observed *property* (something people happen to have) is silently transformed into a normative *definition* (what people must be) -- this reversal from property to definition is perhaps the collection's most original philosophical move, and it recurs throughout.\n\nNote that the reader will encounter two different English words for the same Chinese character within a single passage: 德 appears as \"virtue\" when quoting Laozi and as \"character\" when the author analyzes the concept. This is deliberate, not an inconsistency -- it reflects the author's argument that the traditional reading (virtue, imposed from above) conceals the constructive process (character, assembled from below).\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\"\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; \"the off-tone\" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it. This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter. This is not a stylistic preference but a philosophical necessity: if the reader's experience is the evidence for the author's claims, then a translation that preserves the words but fails to produce the experience has lost the argument. In these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n\n---\n\n## Glossary\n\n*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":128,"oldLines":7,"newStart":128,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," A critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle.

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by practice. The author thinks from within the Chinese philosophical tradition -- drawing on the *Laozi*, the *Yijing*, and the Confucian vocabulary of 仁, 义, 礼, and 德 -- while subjecting that tradition to a radical constructivist reinterpretation. This dual formation -- Chinese philosophical inheritance and scientific training -- is not incidental to the text. Physics concepts recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\nThe collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\nTo make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n\nReaders familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not grounded in inherent existence, functional within its own terms.\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms depart from common translations for specific reasons: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" rather than the more common \"benevolence\" (following Ames and Rosemont), because the author emphasizes the inner felt experience of fellow-feeling before any outward action -- \"benevolence\" connotes charitable giving, which is too external. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness\" rather than \"righteousness,\" because the author treats it as a motivational disposition (the felt impulse connecting inner feeling to action), not a moralistic or absolutist judgment. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct\" rather than \"rites\" or \"propriety,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension that the author takes as the phenomenal starting point.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument. Readers should watch for the moment when the author shows how an inductively observed *property* (something people happen to have) is silently transformed into a normative *definition* (what people must be) -- this reversal from property to definition is perhaps the collection's most original philosophical move, and it recurs throughout.\n\nNote that the reader will encounter two different English words for the same Chinese character within a single passage: 德 appears as \"virtue\" when quoting Laozi and as \"character\" when the author analyzes the concept. This is deliberate, not an inconsistency -- it reflects the author's argument that the traditional reading (virtue, imposed from above) conceals the constructive process (character, assembled from below).\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\"\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; \"the off-tone\" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it. This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter. This is not a stylistic preference but a philosophical necessity: if the reader's experience is the evidence for the author's claims, then a translation that preserves the words but fails to produce the experience has lost the argument. In these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n\n---\n\n## Glossary\n\n*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":142,"oldLines":7,"newStart":142,"newLines":7,"lines":[" - **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena."," - **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality."," ","-The numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\"","+The numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\" Readers familiar with Kant will notice that Zeroth Reality resembles the *Ding an sich* (thing-in-itself), but with a decisive difference: for Kant, the thing-in-itself is a necessary limiting concept that philosophy cannot do without; for this author, Zeroth Reality is genuinely dispensable -- one can do all of philosophy, and live, without ever invoking it."," "," ### Other Terms"," "]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"eb31e5b1-ae5a-4b74-9418-c247ba5af554"}

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by practice. The author thinks from within the Chinese philosophical tradition -- drawing on the *Laozi*, the *Yijing*, and the Confucian vocabulary of 仁, 义, 礼, and 德 -- while subjecting that tradition to a radical constructivist reinterpretation. This dual formation -- Chinese philosophical inheritance and scientific training -- is not incidental to the text. Physics concepts recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\nThe collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\nTo make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n\nReaders familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not grounded in inherent existence, functional within its own terms.\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms depart from common translations for specific reasons: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" rather than the more common \"benevolence\" (following Ames and Rosemont), because the author emphasizes the inner felt experience of fellow-feeling before any outward action -- \"benevolence\" connotes charitable giving, which is too external. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness\" rather than \"righteousness,\" because the author treats it as a motivational disposition (the felt impulse connecting inner feeling to action), not a moralistic or absolutist judgment. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct\" rather than \"rites\" or \"propriety,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension that the author takes as the phenomenal starting point.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument. Readers should watch for the moment when the author shows how an inductively observed *property* (something people happen to have) is silently transformed into a normative *definition* (what people must be) -- this reversal from property to definition is perhaps the collection's most original philosophical move, and it recurs throughout.\n\nNote that the reader will encounter two different English words for the same Chinese character within a single passage: 德 appears as \"virtue\" when quoting Laozi and as \"character\" when the author analyzes the concept. This is deliberate, not an inconsistency -- it reflects the author's argument that the traditional reading (virtue, imposed from above) conceals the constructive process (character, assembled from below).\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\" Readers familiar with Kant will notice that Zeroth Reality resembles the *Ding an sich* (thing-in-itself), but with a decisive difference: for Kant, the thing-in-itself is a necessary limiting concept that philosophy cannot do without; for this author, Zeroth Reality is genuinely dispensable -- one can do all of philosophy, and live, without ever invoking it.\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; \"the off-tone\" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it. This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter. This is not a stylistic preference but a philosophical necessity: if the reader's experience is the evidence for the author's claims, then a translation that preserves the words but fails to produce the experience has lost the argument. In these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n\n---\n\n## Glossary\n\n*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":49,"oldLines":6,"newStart":49,"newLines":8,"lines":[" "," We recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last."," ","+Two structural claims of the collection deserve advance notice.

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by practice. The author thinks from within the Chinese philosophical tradition -- drawing on the *Laozi*, the *Yijing*, and the Confucian vocabulary of 仁, 义, 礼, and 德 -- while subjecting that tradition to a radical constructivist reinterpretation. This dual formation -- Chinese philosophical inheritance and scientific training -- is not incidental to the text. Physics concepts recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\nThe collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\nTwo structural claims of the collection deserve advance notice. First, the author treats nihilism not as the negation of metaphysics but as its *consequence*: when metaphysical systems claim to describe ultimate reality and then fail, the void they leave is nihilism. Post-metaphysics is the path that emerges after recognizing this -- not by rejecting metaphysical construction, but by practicing it lucidly. Second, the author treats absurdity not as a permanent human condition (as in Camus) but as a structural collapse: absurdity arises when one's Jing seeks meaning externally and finds none. The dissolution of absurdity -- demonstrated in Essay 3 through the progression from Sisyphus to cat ownership -- is achieved not by revolt but by reconstructing the Jing so that meaning is internally generated.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\nTo make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n\nReaders familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not grounded in inherent existence, functional within its own terms.\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms depart from common translations for specific reasons: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" rather than the more common \"benevolence\" (following Ames and Rosemont), because the author emphasizes the inner felt experience of fellow-feeling before any outward action -- \"benevolence\" connotes charitable giving, which is too external. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness\" rather than \"righteousness,\" because the author treats it as a motivational disposition (the felt impulse connecting inner feeling to action), not a moralistic or absolutist judgment. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct\" rather than \"rites\" or \"propriety,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension that the author takes as the phenomenal starting point.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument. Readers should watch for the moment when the author shows how an inductively observed *property* (something people happen to have) is silently transformed into a normative *definition* (what people must be) -- this reversal from property to definition is perhaps the collection's most original philosophical move, and it recurs throughout.\n\nNote that the reader will encounter two different English words for the same Chinese character within a single passage: 德 appears as \"virtue\" when quoting Laozi and as \"character\" when the author analyzes the concept. This is deliberate, not an inconsistency -- it reflects the author's argument that the traditional reading (virtue, imposed from above) conceals the constructive process (character, assembled from below).\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\" Readers familiar with Kant will notice that Zeroth Reality resembles the *Ding an sich* (thing-in-itself), but with a decisive difference: for Kant, the thing-in-itself is a necessary limiting concept that philosophy cannot do without; for this author, Zeroth Reality is genuinely dispensable -- one can do all of philosophy, and live, without ever invoking it.\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; \"the off-tone\" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it. This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter. This is not a stylistic preference but a philosophical necessity: if the reader's experience is the evidence for the author's claims, then a translation that preserves the words but fails to produce the experience has lost the argument. In these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n\n---\n\n## Glossary\n\n*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":118,"oldLines":7,"newStart":118,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," ### Dreamscape (梦境)"," ","-The author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits.

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by practice. The author thinks from within the Chinese philosophical tradition -- drawing on the *Laozi*, the *Yijing*, and the Confucian vocabulary of 仁, 义, 礼, and 德 -- while subjecting that tradition to a radical constructivist reinterpretation. This dual formation -- Chinese philosophical inheritance and scientific training -- is not incidental to the text. Physics concepts recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\nTwo structural claims of the collection deserve advance notice. First, the author treats nihilism not as the negation of metaphysics but as its *consequence*: when metaphysical systems claim to describe ultimate reality and then fail, the void they leave is nihilism. Post-metaphysics is the path that emerges after recognizing this -- not by rejecting metaphysical construction, but by practicing it lucidly. Second, the author treats absurdity not as a permanent human condition (as in Camus) but as a structural collapse: absurdity arises when one's Jing seeks meaning externally and finds none. The dissolution of absurdity -- demonstrated in Essay 3 through the progression from Sisyphus to cat ownership -- is achieved not by revolt but by reconstructing the Jing so that meaning is internally generated.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\nTo make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n\nReaders familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not necessarily grounded in anything beyond the experience itself, functional within its own terms. (The author does not commit to the Madhyamaka ontology of the Diamond Sutra; the parallel is structural, not doctrinal.)\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms depart from common translations for specific reasons: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" rather than the more common \"benevolence\" (following Ames and Rosemont), because the author emphasizes the inner felt experience of fellow-feeling before any outward action -- \"benevolence\" connotes charitable giving, which is too external. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness\" rather than \"righteousness,\" because the author treats it as a motivational disposition (the felt impulse connecting inner feeling to action), not a moralistic or absolutist judgment. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct\" rather than \"rites\" or \"propriety,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension that the author takes as the phenomenal starting point.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument. Readers should watch for the moment when the author shows how an inductively observed *property* (something people happen to have) is silently transformed into a normative *definition* (what people must be) -- this reversal from property to definition is perhaps the collection's most original philosophical move, and it recurs throughout.\n\nNote that the reader will encounter two different English words for the same Chinese character within a single passage: 德 appears as \"virtue\" when quoting Laozi and as \"character\" when the author analyzes the concept. This is deliberate, not an inconsistency -- it reflects the author's argument that the traditional reading (virtue, imposed from above) conceals the constructive process (character, assembled from below).\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\" Readers familiar with Kant will notice that Zeroth Reality resembles the *Ding an sich* (thing-in-itself), but with a decisive difference: for Kant, the thing-in-itself is a necessary limiting concept that philosophy cannot do without; for this author, Zeroth Reality is genuinely dispensable -- one can do all of philosophy, and live, without ever invoking it.\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; \"the off-tone\" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it. This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter. This is not a stylistic preference but a philosophical necessity: if the reader's experience is the evidence for the author's claims, then a translation that preserves the words but fails to produce the experience has lost the argument. In these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n\n---\n\n## Glossary\n\n*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":144,"oldLines":6,"newStart":144,"newLines":14,"lines":[" "," The numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\" Readers familiar with Kant will notice that Zeroth Reality resembles the *Ding an sich* (thing-in-itself), but with a decisive difference: for Kant, the thing-in-itself is a necessary limiting concept that philosophy cannot do without; for this author, Zeroth Reality is genuinely dispensable -- one can do all of philosophy, and live, without ever invoking it."," ","+### Stable Structures (稳定结构)","+","+Patterns that persist as a Jing evolves over time -- the author's empirical replacement for a priori categories. Where Kant deduces the categories of understanding from the table of judgments, the author treats stable structures as discovered through experience and subject to revision: they are what survives the evolution of a Jing, not what precedes it. In mathematical contexts, these are denoted **S_E**.","+","+### Natural Transformations and Understanding (自然变换 / 理解)","+","+The collection's most technically innovative contribution: the author formalizes \"understanding\" as a natural transformation (a standard concept in category theory) between two Jing-structures. When two people understand each other, or when a reader understands a text, what occurs is a structural alignment -- a systematic mapping that preserves associations. The felt confirmation that understanding has occurred is denoted **eta** (η). When eta is an identity morphism -- when no mediation is needed -- the author calls this **mastery** (掌握, *zhangwo*). This formalization provides a precise, non-mysterious account of intersubjectivity: shared understanding does not require shared inner experience, only structural alignment.","+"," ### Other Terms"," "," **联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; \"the off-tone\" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological)."]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"a024d1d8-f667-4d0f-a90d-58adf738a1de"}

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n    15→\n    16→集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n    17→\n    18→No single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n    19→\n    20→The author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n    21→\n    22→We treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n    23→\n    24→The \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n    25→\n    26→---\n    27→\n    28→## The Author\n    29→\n    30→The author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by practice. The author thinks from within the Chinese philosophical tradition -- drawing on the *Laozi*, the *Yijing*, and the Confucian vocabulary of 仁, 义, 礼, and 德 -- while subjecting that tradition to a radical constructivist reinterpretation. This dual formation -- Chinese philosophical inheritance and scientific training -- is not incidental to the text. Physics concepts recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n    31→\n    32→The author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n    33→\n    34→---\n    35→\n    36→## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n    37→\n    38→The collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n    39→\n    40→- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n    41→- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n    42→- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n    43→\n    44→The division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n    45→\n    46→This is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n    47→\n    48→We recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n    49→\n    50→Two structural claims of the collection deserve advance notice. First, the author treats nihilism not as the negation of metaphysics but as its *consequence*: when metaphysical systems claim to describe ultimate reality and then fail, the void they leave is nihilism. Post-metaphysics is the path that emerges after recognizing this -- not by rejecting metaphysical construction, but by practicing it lucidly. Second, the author treats absurdity not as a permanent human condition (as in Camus) but as a structural collapse: absurdity arises when one's Jing seeks meaning externally and finds none. The dissolution of absurdity -- demonstrated in Essay 3 through the progression from Sisyphus to cat ownership -- is achieved not by revolt but by reconstructing the Jing so that meaning is internally generated.\n    51→\n    52→---\n    53→\n    54→## A Bilingual Collection\n    55→\n    56→One of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n    57→\n    58→We have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n    59→\n    60→We have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms -- particularly \"phenomena\" and \"digestion\" -- to their counterparts in the translated essays. Three translator's footnotes within the essay connect its key terms to the formal apparatus of Part 2.\n    61→\n    62→---\n    63→\n    64→## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n    65→\n    66→A note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n    67→\n    68→The Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n    69→\n    70→> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n    71→> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n    72→\n    73→In its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n    74→\n    75→The author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n    76→\n    77→This reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n    78→\n    79→A footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n    80→\n    81→---\n    82→\n    83→## Key Terminological Decisions\n    84→\n    85→These essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n    86→\n    87→### Jing (境) and E\n    88→\n    89→As discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n    90→\n    91→### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n    92→\n    93→The author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n    94→\n    95→### Phenomena (现象)\n    96→\n    97→The author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n    98→\n    99→### Constancy (恒常)\n   100→\n   101→The drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n   102→\n   103→### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n   104→\n   105→The author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n   106→\n   107→### The Poetic (诗意)\n   108→\n   109→The author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n   110→\n   111→\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n   112→\n   113→To make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n   114→\n   115→Readers familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n   116→\n   117→### Dreamscape (梦境)\n   118→\n   119→The author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not necessarily grounded in anything beyond the experience itself, functional within its own terms. (The author does not commit to the Madhyamaka ontology of the Diamond Sutra; the parallel is structural, not doctrinal.)\n   120→\n   121→### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n   122→\n   123→The author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n   124→\n   125→### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n   126→\n   127→In Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n   128→\n   129→A critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n   130→\n   131→The remaining terms depart from common translations for specific reasons: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" rather than the more common \"benevolence\" (following Ames and Rosemont), because the author emphasizes the inner felt experience of fellow-feeling before any outward action -- \"benevolence\" connotes charitable giving, which is too external. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness\" rather than \"righteousness,\" because the author treats it as a motivational disposition (the felt impulse connecting inner feeling to action), not a moralistic or absolutist judgment. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct\" rather than \"rites\" or \"propriety,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension that the author takes as the phenomenal starting point.\n   132→\n   133→The author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument. Readers should watch for the moment when the author shows how an inductively observed *property* (something people happen to have) is silently transformed into a normative *definition* (what people must be) -- this reversal from property to definition is perhaps the collection's most original philosophical move, and it recurs throughout.\n   134→\n   135→Note that the reader will encounter two different English words for the same Chinese character within a single passage: 德 appears as \"virtue\" when quoting Laozi and as \"character\" when the author analyzes the concept. This is deliberate, not an inconsistency -- it reflects the author's argument that the traditional reading (virtue, imposed from above) conceals the constructive process (character, assembled from below).\n   136→\n   137→### Three Realities\n   138→\n   139→The author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n   140→\n   141→- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n   142→- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n   143→- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n   144→\n   145→The numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\" Readers familiar with Kant will notice that Zeroth Reality resembles the *Ding an sich* (thing-in-itself), but with a decisive difference: for Kant, the thing-in-itself is a necessary limiting concept that philosophy cannot do without; for this author, Zeroth Reality is genuinely dispensable -- one can do all of philosophy, and live, without ever invoking it.\n   146→\n   147→### Stable Structures (稳定结构)\n   148→\n   149→Patterns that persist as a Jing evolves over time -- the author's empirical replacement for a priori categories. Where Kant deduces the categories of understanding from the table of judgments, the author treats stable structures as discovered through experience and subject to revision: they are what survives the evolution of a Jing, not what precedes it. In mathematical contexts, these are denoted **S_E**.\n   150→\n   151→### Natural Transformations and Understanding (自然变换 / 理解)\n   152→\n   153→The collection's most technically innovative contribution: the author formalizes \"understanding\" as a natural transformation (a standard concept in category theory) between two Jing-structures. When two people understand each other, or when a reader understands a text, what occurs is a structural alignment -- a systematic mapping that preserves associations. The felt confirmation that understanding has occurred is denoted **eta** (η). When eta is an identity morphism -- when no mediation is needed -- the author calls this **mastery** (掌握, *zhangwo*). This formalization provides a precise, non-mysterious account of intersubjectivity: shared understanding does not require shared inner experience, only structural alignment.\n   154→\n   155→### Other Terms\n   156→\n   157→**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; \"the off-tone\" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n   158→\n   159→A complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n   160→\n   161→---\n   162→\n   163→## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n   164→\n   165→This collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it. This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n   166→\n   167→Three examples, among many:\n   168→\n   169→In Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n   170→\n   171→In Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n   172→\n   173→In Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n   174→\n   175→We have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter. This is not a stylistic preference but a philosophical necessity: if the reader's experience is the evidence for the author's claims, then a translation that preserves the words but fails to produce the experience has lost the argument. In these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n   176→\n   177→---\n   178→\n   179→## A Note on Reading\n   180→\n   181→The author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n   182→\n   183→The three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n   184→\n   185→Readers without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone.

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by practice. The author thinks from within the Chinese philosophical tradition -- drawing on the *Laozi*, the *Yijing*, and the Confucian vocabulary of 仁, 义, 礼, and 德 -- while subjecting that tradition to a radical constructivist reinterpretation. This dual formation -- Chinese philosophical inheritance and scientific training -- is not incidental to the text. Physics concepts recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\nTwo structural claims of the collection deserve advance notice. First, the author treats nihilism not as the negation of metaphysics but as its *consequence*: when metaphysical systems claim to describe ultimate reality and then fail, the void they leave is nihilism. Post-metaphysics is the path that emerges after recognizing this -- not by rejecting metaphysical construction, but by practicing it lucidly. Second, the author treats absurdity not as a permanent human condition (as in Camus) but as a structural collapse: absurdity arises when one's Jing seeks meaning externally and finds none. The dissolution of absurdity -- demonstrated in Essay 3 through the progression from Sisyphus to cat ownership -- is achieved not by revolt but by reconstructing the Jing so that meaning is internally generated.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms -- particularly \"phenomena\" and \"digestion\" -- to their counterparts in the translated essays. Three translator's footnotes within the essay connect its key terms to the formal apparatus of Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\nTo make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n\nReaders familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not necessarily grounded in anything beyond the experience itself, functional within its own terms. (The author does not commit to the Madhyamaka ontology of the Diamond Sutra; the parallel is structural, not doctrinal.)\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms depart from common translations for specific reasons: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" rather than the more common \"benevolence\" (following Ames and Rosemont), because the author emphasizes the inner felt experience of fellow-feeling before any outward action -- \"benevolence\" connotes charitable giving, which is too external. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness\" rather than \"righteousness,\" because the author treats it as a motivational disposition (the felt impulse connecting inner feeling to action), not a moralistic or absolutist judgment. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct\" rather than \"rites\" or \"propriety,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension that the author takes as the phenomenal starting point.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument. Readers should watch for the moment when the author shows how an inductively observed *property* (something people happen to have) is silently transformed into a normative *definition* (what people must be) -- this reversal from property to definition is perhaps the collection's most original philosophical move, and it recurs throughout.\n\nNote that the reader will encounter two different English words for the same Chinese character within a single passage: 德 appears as \"virtue\" when quoting Laozi and as \"character\" when the author analyzes the concept. This is deliberate, not an inconsistency -- it reflects the author's argument that the traditional reading (virtue, imposed from above) conceals the constructive process (character, assembled from below).\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\" Readers familiar with Kant will notice that Zeroth Reality resembles the *Ding an sich* (thing-in-itself), but with a decisive difference: for Kant, the thing-in-itself is a necessary limiting concept that philosophy cannot do without; for this author, Zeroth Reality is genuinely dispensable -- one can do all of philosophy, and live, without ever invoking it.\n\n### Stable Structures (稳定结构)\n\nPatterns that persist as a Jing evolves over time -- the author's empirical replacement for a priori categories. Where Kant deduces the categories of understanding from the table of judgments, the author treats stable structures as discovered through experience and subject to revision: they are what survives the evolution of a Jing, not what precedes it. In mathematical contexts, these are denoted **S_E**.\n\n### Natural Transformations and Understanding (自然变换 / 理解)\n\nThe collection's most technically innovative contribution: the author formalizes \"understanding\" as a natural transformation (a standard concept in category theory) between two Jing-structures. When two people understand each other, or when a reader understands a text, what occurs is a structural alignment -- a systematic mapping that preserves associations. The felt confirmation that understanding has occurred is denoted **eta** (η). When eta is an identity morphism -- when no mediation is needed -- the author calls this **mastery** (掌握, *zhangwo*). This formalization provides a precise, non-mysterious account of intersubjectivity: shared understanding does not require shared inner experience, only structural alignment.\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; \"the off-tone\" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it. This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter. This is not a stylistic preference but a philosophical necessity: if the reader's experience is the evidence for the author's claims, then a translation that preserves the words but fails to produce the experience has lost the argument. In these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n\n---\n\n## Glossary\n\n*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n","numLines":196,"startLine":1,"totalLines":196}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"e5378b73-7739-4e63-bfc6-8e5716365613"}

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by practice. The author thinks from within the Chinese philosophical tradition -- drawing on the *Laozi*, the *Yijing*, and the Confucian vocabulary of 仁, 义, 礼, and 德 -- while subjecting that tradition to a radical constructivist reinterpretation. This dual formation -- Chinese philosophical inheritance and scientific training -- is not incidental to the text. Physics concepts recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\nTwo structural claims of the collection deserve advance notice. First, the author treats nihilism not as the negation of metaphysics but as its *consequence*: when metaphysical systems claim to describe ultimate reality and then fail, the void they leave is nihilism. Post-metaphysics is the path that emerges after recognizing this -- not by rejecting metaphysical construction, but by practicing it lucidly. Second, the author treats absurdity not as a permanent human condition (as in Camus) but as a structural collapse: absurdity arises when one's Jing seeks meaning externally and finds none. The dissolution of absurdity -- demonstrated in Essay 3 through the progression from Sisyphus to cat ownership -- is achieved not by revolt but by reconstructing the Jing so that meaning is internally generated.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms -- particularly \"phenomena\" and \"digestion\" -- to their counterparts in the translated essays. Three translator's footnotes within the essay connect its key terms to the formal apparatus of Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\nTo make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n\nReaders familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not necessarily grounded in anything beyond the experience itself, functional within its own terms. (The author does not commit to the Madhyamaka ontology of the Diamond Sutra; the parallel is structural, not doctrinal.)\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms depart from common translations for specific reasons: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" rather than the more common \"benevolence\" (following Ames and Rosemont), because the author emphasizes the inner felt experience of fellow-feeling before any outward action -- \"benevolence\" connotes charitable giving, which is too external. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness\" rather than \"righteousness,\" because the author treats it as a motivational disposition (the felt impulse connecting inner feeling to action), not a moralistic or absolutist judgment. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct\" rather than \"rites\" or \"propriety,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension that the author takes as the phenomenal starting point.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument. Readers should watch for the moment when the author shows how an inductively observed *property* (something people happen to have) is silently transformed into a normative *definition* (what people must be) -- this reversal from property to definition is perhaps the collection's most original philosophical move, and it recurs throughout.\n\nNote that the reader will encounter two different English words for the same Chinese character within a single passage: 德 appears as \"virtue\" when quoting Laozi and as \"character\" when the author analyzes the concept. This is deliberate, not an inconsistency -- it reflects the author's argument that the traditional reading (virtue, imposed from above) conceals the constructive process (character, assembled from below).\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\" Readers familiar with Kant will notice that Zeroth Reality resembles the *Ding an sich* (thing-in-itself), but with a decisive difference: for Kant, the thing-in-itself is a necessary limiting concept that philosophy cannot do without; for this author, Zeroth Reality is genuinely dispensable -- one can do all of philosophy, and live, without ever invoking it.\n\n### Stable Structures (稳定结构)\n\nPatterns that persist as a Jing evolves over time -- the author's empirical replacement for a priori categories. Where Kant deduces the categories of understanding from the table of judgments, the author treats stable structures as discovered through experience and subject to revision: they are what survives the evolution of a Jing, not what precedes it. In mathematical contexts, these are denoted **S_E**.\n\n### Natural Transformations and Understanding (自然变换 / 理解)\n\nThe collection's most technically innovative contribution: the author formalizes \"understanding\" as a natural transformation (a standard concept in category theory) between two Jing-structures. When two people understand each other, or when a reader understands a text, what occurs is a structural alignment -- a systematic mapping that preserves associations. The felt confirmation that understanding has occurred is denoted **eta** (η). When eta is an identity morphism -- when no mediation is needed -- the author calls this **mastery** (掌握, *zhangwo*). This formalization provides a precise, non-mysterious account of intersubjectivity: shared understanding does not require shared inner experience, only structural alignment.\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; \"the off-tone\" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it. This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter. This is not a stylistic preference but a philosophical necessity: if the reader's experience is the evidence for the author's claims, then a translation that preserves the words but fails to produce the experience has lost the argument. In these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n\n---\n\n## Glossary\n\n*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":31,"oldLines":6,"newStart":31,"newLines":8,"lines":[" "," The author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience.

Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n    19→\n    20→The author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them.

We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n    35→\n    36→---\n    37→\n    38→## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n    39→\n    40→The collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n    41→\n    42→- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n    43→- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n    44→- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n    45→\n    46→The division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n    47→\n    48→This is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n    49→\n    50→We recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n    51→\n    52→Two structural claims of the collection deserve advance notice. First, the author treats nihilism not as the negation of metaphysics but as its *consequence*: when metaphysical systems claim to describe ultimate reality and then fail, the void they leave is nihilism. Post-metaphysics is the path that emerges after recognizing this -- not by rejecting metaphysical construction, but by practicing it lucidly. Second, the author treats absurdity not as a permanent human condition (as in Camus) but as a structural collapse: absurdity arises when one's Jing seeks meaning externally and finds none. The dissolution of absurdity -- demonstrated in Essay 3 through the progression from Sisyphus to cat ownership -- is achieved not by revolt but by reconstructing the Jing so that meaning is internally generated.\n    53→\n    54→---\n    55→\n    56→## A Bilingual Collection\n    57→\n    58→One of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n    59→\n    60→We have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n    61→\n    62→We have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms -- particularly \"phenomena\" and \"digestion\" -- to their counterparts in the translated essays. Three translator's footnotes within the essay connect its key terms to the formal apparatus of Part 2.\n    63→\n    64→---\n    65→\n    66→## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n    67→\n    68→A note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n    69→\n    70→The Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n    71→\n    72→> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n    73→> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n    74→\n    75→In its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n    76→\n    77→The author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n    78→\n    79→This reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n    80→\n    81→A footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n    82→\n    83→---\n    84→\n    85→## Key Terminological Decisions\n    86→\n    87→These essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n    88→\n    89→### Jing (境) and E\n    90→\n    91→As discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n    92→\n    93→### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n    94→\n    95→The author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n    96→\n    97→### Phenomena (现象)\n    98→\n    99→The author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n   100→\n   101→### Constancy (恒常)\n   102→\n   103→The drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n   104→\n   105→### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n   106→\n   107→The author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n   108→\n   109→### The Poetic (诗意)\n   110→\n   111→The author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n   112→\n   113→\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n   114→\n   115→To make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n   116→\n   117→Readers familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n   118→\n   119→### Dreamscape (梦境)\n   120→\n   121→The author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not necessarily grounded in anything beyond the experience itself, functional within its own terms. (The author does not commit to the Madhyamaka ontology of the Diamond Sutra; the parallel is structural, not doctrinal.)\n   122→\n   123→### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n   124→\n   125→The author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n   126→\n   127→### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n   128→\n   129→In Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n   130→\n   131→A critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n   132→\n   133→The remaining terms depart from common translations for specific reasons: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" rather than the more common \"benevolence\" (following Ames and Rosemont), because the author emphasizes the inner felt experience of fellow-feeling before any outward action -- \"benevolence\" connotes charitable giving, which is too external. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness\" rather than \"righteousness,\" because the author treats it as a motivational disposition (the felt impulse connecting inner feeling to action), not a moralistic or absolutist judgment. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct\" rather than \"rites\" or \"propriety,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension that the author takes as the phenomenal starting point.\n   134→\n   135→The author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument. Readers should watch for the moment when the author shows how an inductively observed *property* (something people happen to have) is silently transformed into a normative *definition* (what people must be) -- this reversal from property to definition is perhaps the collection's most original philosophical move, and it recurs throughout.\n   136→\n   137→Note that the reader will encounter two different English words for the same Chinese character within a single passage: 德 appears as \"virtue\" when quoting Laozi and as \"character\" when the author analyzes the concept. This is deliberate, not an inconsistency -- it reflects the author's argument that the traditional reading (virtue, imposed from above) conceals the constructive process (character, assembled from below).\n   138→\n   139→### Three Realities\n   140→\n   141→The author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n   142→\n   143→- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n   144→- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n   145→- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n   146→\n   147→The numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\" Readers familiar with Kant will notice that Zeroth Reality resembles the *Ding an sich* (thing-in-itself), but with a decisive difference: for Kant, the thing-in-itself is a necessary limiting concept that philosophy cannot do without; for this author, Zeroth Reality is genuinely dispensable -- one can do all of philosophy, and live, without ever invoking it.\n   148→\n   149→### Stable Structures (稳定结构)\n   150→\n   151→Patterns that persist as a Jing evolves over time -- the author's empirical replacement for a priori categories. Where Kant deduces the categories of understanding from the table of judgments, the author treats stable structures as discovered through experience and subject to revision: they are what survives the evolution of a Jing, not what precedes it. In mathematical contexts, these are denoted **S_E**.\n   152→\n   153→### Natural Transformations and Understanding (自然变换 / 理解)\n   154→\n   155→The collection's most technically innovative contribution: the author formalizes \"understanding\" as a natural transformation (a standard concept in category theory) between two Jing-structures. When two people understand each other, or when a reader understands a text, what occurs is a structural alignment -- a systematic mapping that preserves associations. The felt confirmation that understanding has occurred is denoted **eta** (η). When eta is an identity morphism -- when no mediation is needed -- the author calls this **mastery** (掌握, *zhangwo*). This formalization provides a precise, non-mysterious account of intersubjectivity: shared understanding does not require shared inner experience, only structural alignment.\n   156→\n   157→### Other Terms\n   158→\n   159→**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; \"the off-tone\" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n   160→\n   161→A complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n   162→\n   163→---\n   164→\n   165→## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n   166→\n   167→This collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it. This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n   168→\n   169→Three examples, among many:\n   170→\n   171→In Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n   172→\n   173→In Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n   174→\n   175→In Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n   176→\n   177→We have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter. This is not a stylistic preference but a philosophical necessity: if the reader's experience is the evidence for the author's claims, then a translation that preserves the words but fails to produce the experience has lost the argument. In these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n   178→\n   179→---\n   180→\n   181→## A Note on Reading\n   182→\n   183→The author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n   184→\n   185→The three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n   186→\n   187→Readers without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n   188→\n   189→---\n   190→\n   191→*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n   192→\n   193→---\n   194→\n   195→## Glossary\n   196→\n   197→*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n   198→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by practice. The author thinks from within the Chinese philosophical tradition -- drawing on the *Laozi*, the *Yijing*, and the Confucian vocabulary of 仁, 义, 礼, and 德 -- while subjecting that tradition to a radical constructivist reinterpretation. This dual formation -- Chinese philosophical inheritance and scientific training -- is not incidental to the text. Physics concepts recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\nThe collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\nTwo structural claims of the collection deserve advance notice. First, the author treats nihilism not as the negation of metaphysics but as its *consequence*: when metaphysical systems claim to describe ultimate reality and then fail, the void they leave is nihilism. Post-metaphysics is the path that emerges after recognizing this -- not by rejecting metaphysical construction, but by practicing it lucidly. Second, the author treats absurdity not as a permanent human condition (as in Camus) but as a structural collapse: absurdity arises when one's Jing seeks meaning externally and finds none. The dissolution of absurdity -- demonstrated in Essay 3 through the progression from Sisyphus to cat ownership -- is achieved not by revolt but by reconstructing the Jing so that meaning is internally generated.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms -- particularly \"phenomena\" and \"digestion\" -- to their counterparts in the translated essays. Three translator's footnotes within the essay connect its key terms to the formal apparatus of Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\nTo make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n\nReaders familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not necessarily grounded in anything beyond the experience itself, functional within its own terms. (The author does not commit to the Madhyamaka ontology of the Diamond Sutra; the parallel is structural, not doctrinal.)\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms depart from common translations for specific reasons: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" rather than the more common \"benevolence\" (following Ames and Rosemont), because the author emphasizes the inner felt experience of fellow-feeling before any outward action -- \"benevolence\" connotes charitable giving, which is too external. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness\" rather than \"righteousness,\" because the author treats it as a motivational disposition (the felt impulse connecting inner feeling to action), not a moralistic or absolutist judgment. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct\" rather than \"rites\" or \"propriety,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension that the author takes as the phenomenal starting point.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument. Readers should watch for the moment when the author shows how an inductively observed *property* (something people happen to have) is silently transformed into a normative *definition* (what people must be) -- this reversal from property to definition is perhaps the collection's most original philosophical move, and it recurs throughout.\n\nNote that the reader will encounter two different English words for the same Chinese character within a single passage: 德 appears as \"virtue\" when quoting Laozi and as \"character\" when the author analyzes the concept. This is deliberate, not an inconsistency -- it reflects the author's argument that the traditional reading (virtue, imposed from above) conceals the constructive process (character, assembled from below).\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\" Readers familiar with Kant will notice that Zeroth Reality resembles the *Ding an sich* (thing-in-itself), but with a decisive difference: for Kant, the thing-in-itself is a necessary limiting concept that philosophy cannot do without; for this author, Zeroth Reality is genuinely dispensable -- one can do all of philosophy, and live, without ever invoking it.\n\n### Stable Structures (稳定结构)\n\nPatterns that persist as a Jing evolves over time -- the author's empirical replacement for a priori categories. Where Kant deduces the categories of understanding from the table of judgments, the author treats stable structures as discovered through experience and subject to revision: they are what survives the evolution of a Jing, not what precedes it. In mathematical contexts, these are denoted **S_E**.\n\n### Natural Transformations and Understanding (自然变换 / 理解)\n\nThe collection's most technically innovative contribution: the author formalizes \"understanding\" as a natural transformation (a standard concept in category theory) between two Jing-structures. When two people understand each other, or when a reader understands a text, what occurs is a structural alignment -- a systematic mapping that preserves associations. The felt confirmation that understanding has occurred is denoted **eta** (η). When eta is an identity morphism -- when no mediation is needed -- the author calls this **mastery** (掌握, *zhangwo*). This formalization provides a precise, non-mysterious account of intersubjectivity: shared understanding does not require shared inner experience, only structural alignment.\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; \"the off-tone\" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it. This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter. This is not a stylistic preference but a philosophical necessity: if the reader's experience is the evidence for the author's claims, then a translation that preserves the words but fails to produce the experience has lost the argument. In these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n\n---\n\n## Glossary\n\n*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n","numLines":198,"startLine":1,"totalLines":198}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"df4ca2ea-5e22-4851-8a95-9c5b3fdaf8e0"}

All feedback has been addressed:\n\n**MUST FIX (2/2 done):**\n1. Husserl/Kant *Erscheinung* confusion -- rewritten per Kantian expert's suggestion. German terms dropped; now clearly distinguishes author's position from both Kant and Husserl.\n2. 体验 \"lived experience\" -- changed to \"experience in its processual, immersive sense\" per Translation Dictionary.\n\n**SHOULD FIX (3/3 done):**\n3. The Poetic section -- restructured: author's independent path comes first, coin-flip example added for concreteness, Heidegger comparison moved to end as optional comparison.\n4. 形而上 vs 形而上学 parenthetical -- corrected to \"constructing structures upon phenomena\" / \"systematically studying those constructions as a discipline.\"\n5. 恒常 -- softened to \"what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\"\n\n**RECOMMENDED ADDITIONS (12/12 addressed):**\n6. 属性→定义 reversal mechanism -- added in Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li section\n7. Author situated in Chinese tradition -- added to Author section opening\n8. Chinese philosophical experiment precedent (Mencius, Zhuangzi) -- added to Experiential Sequences\n9. Absurdity dissolution -- new paragraph in Fish/Fishing section\n10. Nihilism as consequence of metaphysics -- same paragraph\n11. Diamond Sutra caveat -- softened; added doctrinal disclaimer\n12. Stable structures (稳定结构) -- new subsection in Key Terminological Decisions\n13. Natural transformations / eta -- new subsection explaining understanding as structural alignment\n14. 仁/义/礼 departure rationale -- expanded with specific reasons for each choice\n15. Zeroth Reality vs Ding an sich -- added clause about dispensability\n16. 非和谐 is author's own English coinage -- clarified\n17. \"coins\" -> \"uses\" for 虚妄 -- fixed\n\n**EDITORIAL FLAGS:**\n- Poetic concreteness: coin-flip example added\n- \"knowledge sub-category\" premature reference: already simplified by editor\n- 德 dual rendering: explicit note added (reader will see two English words for same Chinese character)\n- Working-draft paragraph: restored (had been accidentally removed)\n- Experiential fidelity rationale: expanded (\"if the reader's experience is the evidence...\")\n\n**Final state:** ~198 lines, ~5,800 words. 10 sections + glossary placeholder.
