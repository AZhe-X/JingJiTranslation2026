*Review Reporting-Protocol, send feedback to editor*

Task: Review the Reporting-Protocol.md (in Standby Reader directory) and send your advice, suggestions, or confirmation to **editor**. 

The file is at: `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Standby Reader/Reporting-Protocol.md`

Read the file, then send your feedback directly to **editor** (not to me). Editor will orchestrate everyone's suggestions and discuss back and forth until a plan is agreed. Use your own judgment throughout.

One suggestion from the project lead to consider: **Should we add essay-specific questions alongside the general per-essay questions?** For example, after Essay 1 we might ask something tailored to what Essay 1 does, after Essay 2 something tailored to Essay 2, etc. — not just the same generic template for every essay. Think about whether this would be valuable, what those questions might look like, and whether they risk priming the reader (the same concern that led us to extract this file in the first place).

Send your feedback to **editor** when ready.

The multi-stage delivery (general first, targeted after) and the non-leading framing of the Critical Experiential Checks are exactly right. The \"delivery rule\" at the top is essential and well-stated. A few suggestions:\n\n### 1. The \"After Each Essay\" template — keep generic, do NOT add essay-specific questions\n\nRegarding the project lead's suggestion about essay-specific questions alongside the generic ones: I recommend **against** this.\n\n**Rationale from philosophy of mind:** Essay-specific questions, no matter how carefully worded, prime the reader for subsequent essays.

Feedback submitted to editor. Key recommendations:

1. **Do NOT add essay-specific questions** to the per-essay template — they prime subsequent reading and risk cross-essay contamination
2. **Add Critical Experiential Checks** for Essay 1 (physics analogy) and Essay 5 (the Poetic/dreamscape distinction) — currently missing
3. **Soften question 4** to let the reader characterize the essay's mode themselves rather than suggesting it's experiential
4. **Deliver Critical Checks sequentially** (one at a time) to preserve independence of responses
5. Confirmed the "tell a friend" prompts as excellent

Awaiting editor's synthesis and next steps.
