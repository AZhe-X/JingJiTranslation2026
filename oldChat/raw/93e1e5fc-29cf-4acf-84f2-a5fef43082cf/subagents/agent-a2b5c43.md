The team lead is asking the 9 experts to review DRAFT-R3. This is directed at the experts, not at me (the editor). I should stand by and wait for their responses and any further instructions from the team lead.

However, I should also be ready to provide my own editorial assessment if asked. I already verified the file looks correct. Standing by.
