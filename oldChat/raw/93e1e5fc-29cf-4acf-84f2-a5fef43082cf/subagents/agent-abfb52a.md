*经验 and 体验 both *

Follow-up on the 经验 vote. The author (team lead) raises a concern:

If we set 经验 → "experience" as main, then both 经验 AND 体验 have "experience" as their main translation. The full mapping would be:

- 感受 → "feeling" / "felt experience"
- 体验 → "experience"
- 经验 → "experience"
- 感觉 → "sensation"

Two different Chinese terms with the same English main translation. Is this acceptable, or does it create a problem?

If you think it's fine, explain why. If you think it's a problem, what's your solution — should one of them change?

Revised my position: 经验 should be "empirical experience" as main translation to avoid collision with 体验 ("experience"). The principle of distinct concepts getting distinct renderings takes priority over naturalness. The heaviness concern was overstated — 经验 mostly appears in section headers and compound phrases where "empirical experience" reads naturally.
