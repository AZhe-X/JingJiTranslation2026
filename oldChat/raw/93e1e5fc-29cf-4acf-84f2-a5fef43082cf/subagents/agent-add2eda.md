*Weight profile dimensions + vote on *

**Two items for the standby reader profile:**

**Item 1: Weight each profile dimension by significance (out of 10).**

Score each dimension from 1-10 for how important it is to getting the right standby reader:

- A. Education level (graduate-level humanities)
- B. No philosophy specialization
- C. No category theory / formal math
- D. No prior exposure to these essays or our materials
- E. Basic cultural literacy (Sisyphus, metaphysics, Laozi)
- F. Comfort with abstract ideas and sustained argument
- G. Tolerance for foreign terms and mathematical notation on page
- H. Curious and patient disposition
- I. Honest about confusion / not deferential
- J. **Experientially attentive** — notices what happens to them while reading
- K. Life experience (has worked a job, owned a pet, faced decisions)
- L. Reads literary fiction / attentive to prose quality

**Item 2: Vote on "Tell a friend what this is about" as a final prompt.**

The editor proposed asking the standby reader, after completing the full collection: "What would you tell a friend this collection is about?"

Vote: **YES** (keep this prompt) or **NO** (suggest a different/better final prompt).

Let me think carefully about both items. The weighting requires me to consider which dimensions are truly load-bearing for the test we're running — which is fundamentally about whether the experiential sequences work and whether the translation is clear. The "tell a friend" vote requires me to consider what that prompt actually tests.

A sharp undergraduate or an autodidact bookworm would serve just as well. What matters is reading stamina and comfort with demanding texts, not the credential. |\n| B. No philosophy specialization | **8** | High. A philosophy specialist will read Essay 3 as a response to Camus, Essay 4 as a response to Heidegger/Laozi, etc. — engaging as interlocutor rather than undergoing the experiential sequence. The whole point of Part 1 (Fish) is that it works WITHOUT the reader knowing the methodology. A philosophy major has too much scaffolding already in place. |\n| C

Response sent to team lead. Here's a summary of my submission:

**Dimension Weights** — The key pattern I identified: what matters most is the reader's *naivete* and their *self-awareness about their own reading experience*, not credentials.

- **Top tier (9-10):** No prior exposure to these essays (10), experiential attentiveness (10), no category theory (9), honesty about confusion (9)
- **High tier (7-8):** No philosophy specialization (8), comfort with sustained argument (8), curious/patient disposition (8), basic cultural literacy (7), tolerance for foreign terms (7)
- **Moderate tier (5-6):** Education level (5), life experience (6), literary fiction reading (6)

**"Tell a friend" prompt** — Voted **YES** with one proposed addition: "Would you recommend it to them? Why or why not?" This tests whether the translation preserved not just intellectual content but the experiential reward of reading — whether the collection was *worth having read*, not just comprehensible.

Now idle and awaiting the next item from the team lead.
