*Q6: How to render the author's personal 虚妄*

Second question for you — Q6: the rendering of 虚妄.

In Essay 5 (形而上学后的目的：诗意), the author coins 虚妄 as a personal term. The author's footnote explains:
- 虚 = "without real significance" (没有实在意义的)
- 妄 = "arrogant, self-deceptive" (自大且自我蒙蔽的)

This describes the stance of someone who claims to reject ALL dreamscapes/meaning-structures — the radical nihilist who insists nothing matters. The author argues this is impossible because we are constituted by feeling.

My concern: In Buddhist Chinese, 虚妄 is a well-established term meaning "illusory, unreal" (related to maya/幻). The Heart Sutra's 远离颠倒梦想 treats this kind of 妄 as delusion to be transcended. The author's usage is DIFFERENT — it's not about illusion but about the arrogant pretension of claiming to stand outside all meaning-structures.

**Questions**:
1. Can you confirm that the author's 虚妄 is NOT the Buddhist 虚妄? Are there any risks of conflation?
2. Which English rendering best captures the author's personal coinage WITHOUT activating Buddhist "delusion/illusion" associations?

Options:
1. **"delusion"** — too Buddhist (moha/痴), too passive, misses arrogance
2. **"vain presumption"** — captures arrogance + emptiness, slightly archaic
3. **"vain delusion"** — combines both, but redundant?
4. **"presumptuous emptiness"** — captures both components, awkward
5. **"hollow arrogance"** — right meaning, wrong register

Response sent to the translator. Key points:

- **Confirmed:** The author's 虚妄 is NOT the Buddhist 虚妄. Buddhist 虚妄 = cognitive illusion (*mṛṣā/vitatha*); the author's = arrogant existential pretension. They share the 虚 (insubstantiality) component but diverge sharply on 妄 (error vs. arrogance).
- **Recommended "vain presumption"** because "vain" mirrors the author's double meaning (empty + conceited) and "presumption" captures the arrogant claim to an impossible standpoint.
- **Rejected "delusion"** (too Buddhist), **"presumptuous emptiness"** (activates sunyata associations -- the most dangerous word in this context), **"hollow arrogance"** (wrong register).
- **Suggested a translator's footnote** explicitly disambiguating from Buddhist 虚妄 to preempt conflation.

Standing by for further questions.
