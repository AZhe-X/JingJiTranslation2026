*Propose standby reader profile — background, knowledge, disposition*

**Standby Reader Profile:** We've unanimously agreed to add a standby reader. Now each of you: propose a **reader profile** — what kind of person should this reader be?

Consider:
1. **Background** — what level of education/reading experience? Philosophy background or not? Math background or not?
2. **What they should NOT know** — what must they be naive about for the test to work?
3. **What they SHOULD know** — minimum literacy/knowledge to engage meaningfully?
4. **Reading instructions** — how should they be told to read? What should they report on?
5. **Personality/disposition** — patient? curious? skeptical? literary-minded?

Submit your proposal to **team-lead**. After collecting all proposals, we'll synthesize.

Let me think carefully about this. The standby reader needs to be the right kind of test subject — someone who can meaningfully engage with the text while still being naive enough to test whether the experiential sequences work. My perspective as the translator is particularly relevant here because I know exactly where the translation's success or failure will be most visible.

Profile proposal sent to team lead. The key points of my proposal:

**Background:** Graduate-educated humanities reader (literature, history, anthropology, law) — NOT philosophy, math, or physics. Someone who reads serious nonfiction for pleasure.

**Must NOT know:** The author's theoretical framework, the specific argumentative punchlines, Camus in detail, or category theory. The test fails if they can anticipate what the experiential sequences are supposed to produce.

**Must know:** Basic cultural literacy (Sisyphus, Confucius, Kant by name), comfort with abstract ideas as dinner-conversation topics, tolerance for foreign terms and mathematical notation on the page.

**Reading instructions:** I drafted specific prompts designed to test whether experiential sequences land, whether difficulty feels productive or translator-induced, and whether the Fish/Fishing structure works — including the critical "I don't understand yet" vs. "this is badly written" distinction.

**Disposition:** Curious, patient, honest, unselfconscious. Reads literary fiction. NOT contrarian by default. Reports genuine experience rather than performing sophistication.

The summary: this reader is the educated general audience the translation is ultimately for.
