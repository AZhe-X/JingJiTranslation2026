*Review Translation Dictionary, report agreement*

REVIEW TASK (experts only, not translator-2):

Please read the master Translation Dictionary at:
/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translation Dictionary.md

Review every entry from your field's perspective. Then reply with your assessment in this format:

**AGREE / DISAGREE / PARTIAL**

If AGREE: "AGREE: all entries are acceptable from [your field]'s perspective."

If DISAGREE or PARTIAL: list each entry you have concerns about, with:
- The term
- Your concern
- Your suggested change (if any)

Be specific and concise. Focus on entries relevant to your expertise. This is the authoritative dictionary that will guide the entire translation.
