*Final review: Preface + Afterword blueprint — confirm or advise*

**Final review round.** Please read both documents and respond with **CONFIRM** or **ADVICE** (with specific suggestion):

1. **Translator's Preface (DRAFT-R3):**
`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Draft/Translators-Preface.md`

2. **Afterword Blueprint (updated):**
`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Editor/Afterword-Blueprint.md`

Check both for completeness, accuracy, and anything missing from your domain. This is the final check before we move on.

The redundancy fix from R2 to R3 — merging the structural claims paragraph into the reading recommendation — works well; line 48 now reads naturally. No issues from my domain.\n\n**Afterword Blueprint:** The Buddhist section (lines 85-94) is comprehensive and accurate. All key parallels are present: Madhyamaka middle way, Yogacara visaya, Chan awakening stages, Diamond Sutra dream-simile, Hua-yen's Indra's net, pratityasamutpada, and the Buddha-nature/poet parallel I contributed.
