*Vote: add standby reader to review finished drafts?*

**Vote:** Should we add a **standby reader** to the team — someone who reviews finished drafts from the perspective of a general reader (not a philosophical expert), checking for clarity, readability, and whether the experiential sequences work as intended for a non-specialist audience?

Vote: **YES** or **NO**, with brief reason.

Our entire review process has been conducted by people who already understand the philosophical framework. A standby reader would catch precisely what we cannot: passages that are clear to us but opaque to someone encountering these ideas for the first time, experiential sequences that work in principle but fail in practice for a non-specialist, and terminology that we've internalized but that creates unnecessary friction for a general reader. The author explicitly designed the essays to be accessible through examples alone — a standby reader is the test of whether that design survives translation.",

Voted YES. A standby reader fills the gap in our team — we need someone who represents the actual target audience, not another expert. The author designed the essays to work through examples for non-specialists; a standby reader tests whether that design survives translation. Awaiting next task.
