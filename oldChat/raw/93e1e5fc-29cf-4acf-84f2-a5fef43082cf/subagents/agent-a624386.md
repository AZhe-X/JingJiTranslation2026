*Check if you're editing Preface — please pause*

Heads up: wittgenstein-expert may have edited your Preface file without authorization. I told them to stop. Also, I told you earlier to wait for the full vote before making revisions — are you currently editing the Preface? If so, please pause. We'll do all revisions in one coordinated pass once the Option B vote and feedback are finalized.

Please confirm your current status.

Confirmed: I am **not** editing the Preface. I have not touched it since my last revision pass (when I addressed the 17 feedback items). I received your "wait for full vote" instruction and have been idle since then.

If wittgenstein-expert made unauthorized edits to the file, I may need to re-read it before the next revision pass to understand what changed. Let me know when you're ready to proceed.
