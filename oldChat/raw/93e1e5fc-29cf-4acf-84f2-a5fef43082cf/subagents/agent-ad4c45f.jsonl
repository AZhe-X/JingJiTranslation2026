It synthesizes recommendations from all nine expert perspectives into a single consensus dictionary, preserving expert agreement, flagging disagreements, and providing the translator with clear guidance for every key term. Terms are ordered by importance and frequency of use in the essays.\n    20→\n    21→**How to Use This Dictionary:**\n    22→- Each entry shows the consensus translation (or best-judgment call where experts disagree).\n    23→- The **DISAGREEMENT** line appears only when experts propose genuinely different main translations. Stylistic variations (e.g., capitalization) are noted under Alternatives, not flagged as disagreements.\n    24→- Notes synthesize insights from all relevant experts. The goal is to give the translator maximum context in minimum space.\n    25→- A Disagreements Summary at the end collects all disputed terms for the author's review.\n    26→\n    27→---\n    28→\n    29→## 境 (jing)\n    30→\n    31→- **Main translation**: Jing (romanized, as technical term)\n    32→- **Morphological echo**: -scape (established in footnote on first introduction; see 境-family system below)\n    33→- **Alternatives**:\n    34→  - \"E\" (in formal/category-theoretic passages, as the author uses)\n    35→  - \"experiential realm\" (discursive contexts)\n    36→  - \"experiential field\" / \"experiential milieu\" (Phenomenology)\n    37→  - \"cognitive-scape\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n    38→  - \"sphere\" (Metaphysics, in literary contexts)\n    39→- **Note**: This is the single most important and most difficult term in the entire collection. All nine experts agree it resists single-word translation. The author defines it as a category-theoretic structure on phenomena (P): objects are selected experiences (感受), morphisms are associations (联想), and morphisms are also objects (tower structure). It evolves dynamically via functors. The term resonates with Buddhist *visaya*/*gocara* (object-domain of consciousness), Husserl's Lebenswelt, Heidegger's Welt, and the Chinese aesthetic tradition of 意境. The author considers alternative names: \"game, book, adventure, small world, small freedom.\" Seven of nine experts recommend keeping \"Jing\" transliterated with an explanatory apparatus on first use; two suggest descriptive glosses (\"experiential field,\" \"scape\"). Do NOT collapse into traditional Buddhist 境界 (spiritual attainment) or aesthetic 意境 -- the author's usage is formally precise. Wittgenstein expert: closest Wittgensteinian concept is \"form of life\" (*Lebensform*), but 境 is more individualistic and formalized; *Lebenswelt* is proximate but more communal. Recommends transliterating as *jing* with extensive initial gloss. Use \"Jing\" consistently, with \"E\" in mathematical/formal passages.\n    40→- **境-family system** (unanimous resolution, all 9 experts + translator):\n    41→  - **境** → Jing (standalone central technical term)\n    42→  - **梦境** → dreamscape (dream + -scape; a type of Jing)\n    43→  - **境界** → bounds / horizon (Jing + boundary; the limits of a Jing — NOT -scape)\n    44→  - **境集** → Jing Ji (title, romanized)\n    45→  - **-scape = 境**: Established in a footnote on first introduction of Jing. The English suffix \"-scape\" (as in landscape, dreamscape) serves as 境's approximate morphological echo: just as a landscape is the structured expanse of land as seen from a standpoint, Jing is a structured experiential space as lived from within. Chinese compounds containing 境 correspond to English \"-scape\" formations: thus 梦境 (dream-境) becomes \"dreamscape.\"\n    46→\n    47→---\n    48→\n    49→## 现象 (xianxiang)\n    50→\n    51→- **Main translation**: phenomena (plural) / phenomenon (singular)\n    52→- **Alternatives**:\n    53→  - \"the phenomenal\" (when used substantively for the field as a whole)\n    54→  - \"phenomenal given\" (emphasizing givenness, Philosophy of Mind)\n    55→  - \"appearance\" (only with strong caveat -- see note)\n    56→- **Note**: All experts agree on \"phenomena\" as main translation. The author uses this term with full phenomenological weight, closer to Husserl's *Phanomen* than to Kant's *Erscheinung*. Phenomena are NOT \"mere appearances\" behind which a truer reality hides; they are the indubitable ground of all experience, identified with \"all feelings taken together\" (全部的感受之总和). Phenomena = First Reality (第一实在). This includes sensory input AND the associations/connections between them. The author explicitly states: \"any understanding we have of phenomena is based on phenomena.\" Buddhism expert notes the parallel with Yogacara: 境 is *vijnapti-matra* (appearance-only). Epistemology expert emphasizes: this is \"practical phenomenalism\" -- whether or not things exist beyond phenomena, only phenomena serve as starting points for justification. AVOID translating as \"appearances\" without caveat, as this risks suggesting phenomena are merely apparent. Wittgenstein expert: \"phenomena\" does not play a central systematic role in Wittgenstein, though he discusses \"phenomenological\" language in *Remarks on Colour* and *Philosophical Remarks*. \"Phenomenon/phenomena\" is standard and adequate.\n    57→\n    58→---\n    59→\n    60→## 感受 (ganshou)\n    61→\n    62→- **Main translation**: feeling\n    63→- **Convention**: \"feeling\" as default. Switch to \"felt experience\" only when 感受 functions as a *technical category label* (i.e., \"any part of P,\" the atomic unit of phenomena in the categorical framework), not when it describes what someone feels in ordinary first-person usage. Trigger criterion: ask \"Is 感受 here naming a *type of thing* (technical) or describing *what someone feels* (ordinary)?\" If the former, \"felt experience\" is available. If the latter, \"feeling.\"\n    64→- **Related terms** (author's own terminological system):\n    65→  - **体验 (tǐyàn)** → \"experience\" (processual, durational, immersive — the act of undergoing). Author explicitly equates with 感受 for referring to parts of P (范畴论与境, line 166), but in practice 体验 leans active/processual while 感受 leans passive/receptive.\n    66→  - **经验 (jīngyàn)** → \"experience\" (accumulated/epistemic — Kantian *Erfahrung*); \"experiential\" (adj); \"empirical experience\" (disambiguation when 体验 is nearby); 经验性的 → \"empirical.\" NEVER synonymous with 感受.\n    67→  - **感觉 (gǎnjué)** → \"sensation\" (raw input, Sense 1 per author's fn2; \"impression\" acceptable locally when referring to a gestalt rather than raw sensory data).\n    68→  - AVOID: \"lived experience\" (too Husserlian — imports *Erlebnis*), \"phenomenal experience\" (redundant with 现象X compounds), \"qualia\" (too loaded with phil-mind debates author sidesteps).\n    69→- **Note**: The author's foundational phenomenological term. The author explicitly distinguishes two senses (诗意 essay, footnote [^2]): (1) received stimuli/information (= 感觉/sensation), (2) the \"crystallization, surge, turbulence\" these give rise to. Both are 感受, but Sense 2 is the primary meaning. P (phenomena) = \"全部的感受之总和\" (the totality of all feelings). \"Meaning and feeling are two sides of one body\" (意义和感受即是两面一体). In the categorical framework (范畴论与境), both objects AND morphisms in E are 感受 — this is why E has tower structure. The self itself IS a 感受: \"'I' is that feeling\" (范畴论与境, line 210). Buddhism expert: parallels Buddhist *vedana* (受, feeling-tone) but broader. Wittgenstein expert: \"feeling\" has serious philosophical pedigree (James, Whitehead, Wittgenstein's own *Gefühl*). The author's register is deliberately non-technical — 感受 is an everyday Chinese word loaded with extraordinary philosophical weight.\n    70→- **Translator's note (TN draft)**: \"感受 (*gǎnshòu*, 'feeling'): the author's term for the basic constituent of phenomena. It encompasses both received stimuli (sensory input) and the felt awareness — the 'crystallization, surge, and turbulence' — these give rise to (see author's footnote [^2] in the Poetics essay). In this work, all elements of phenomena are feelings, and phenomena is defined as 'the totality of all feelings.'\"\n    71→- **DISAGREEMENT**: RESOLVED (10/10 unanimous — 6 for \"feeling\" as default, 4 for \"felt experience\" as default, all 10 confirmed the compromise: \"feeling\" default + \"felt experience\" for technical scope).\n    72→\n    73→---\n    74→\n    75→## 恒常 (hengchang)\n    76→\n    77→- **Main translation**: constancy\n    78→- **Alternatives**:\n    79→  - \"permanence\" (too strong -- implies timeless eternality; use only in explicit Kantian First Analogy contexts)\n    80→  - \"invariance\" (mathematical/formal contexts)\n    81→  - \"stability\" (when referring to stable structures)\n    82→- **Note**: All nine experts converge on \"constancy\" as the best translation. The author identifies this as \"the core of metaphysics\" (形而上的核心是恒常). It is the non-rational demand we impose on phenomena: that patterns will hold, that the same causes produce the same effects, that identity persists across time. The author connects constancy to identity (同一) and causality (因果), noting \"causality is just temporal identity.\" Chinese Philosophy expert emphasizes this is epistemological/pragmatic, NOT ontological -- we *seek* invariant patterns, not asserting things really are permanent. Buddhism expert notes the critical contrast with Buddhist *anitya* (无常, impermanence): Buddhism sees pursuit of permanence as ignorance to overcome; the author sees pursuit of constancy as a non-rational feature to be *recognized and worked with lucidly*. Metaphysics expert: \"constancy\" avoids the excessive strength of \"permanence\" and the weakness of \"regularity.\" Wittgenstein expert: related to the \"hardness\" of certain propositions in *On Certainty* -- propositions that function as the stable framework within which other propositions can be doubted (OC §96). In technical passages connecting 恒常 to functorial preservation, \"invariance\" is more precise.\n    83→\n    84→---\n    85→\n    86→## 诗意 (shiyi)\n    87→\n    88→- **Main translation**: the poetic\n    89→- **Alternatives**:\n    90→  - \"poetic dwelling\" (Heidegger connection)\n    91→  - \"poetic engagement\" / \"poetic stance\" (emphasizing activity/orientation)\n    92→  - \"poeticality\" (Buddhism expert)\n    93→  - \"*shiyi*\" (untranslated, like *Dasein*; Existentialism)\n    94→- **Note**: This is the author's central positive contribution -- the post-metaphysical existential stance. All experts agree it does NOT mean \"poetry\" in the literary sense. It is defined as \"清醒的梦境\" (the lucid dreamscape): being fully invested in meaning while knowing that meaning is constructed. The author: \"After metaphysics, facing meaning should be poetic.\" Contrasted with 沉醉的梦境 (intoxicated dreamscape = pre-metaphysical belief/faith). Existentialism expert: differs from Nietzsche's voluntaristic *amor fati*, Camus's heroic revolt, and Heidegger's quietistic *Gelassenheit* -- it is active but not heroic, aware but not detached. Chinese Philosophy expert recommends capitalizing \"the Poetic\" to signal philosophical weight. Buddhism expert: this is genuinely novel, not found in Buddhist sources; it is the \"third way\" between intoxication and nihilistic void. Kantian expert: closer to Nietzsche's \"gay science\" than Kant's practical reason. Wittgenstein expert: no direct Wittgensteinian equivalent, but resonates with the *Investigations*' own style -- proceeding through examples, metaphors, and invitations to *look* rather than formal argument. The poetic is itself a philosophical method.\n    95→- **DISAGREEMENT**: RESOLVED (unanimous, 10/10). \"The poetic\" as standard substantive form; \"poetic\" as adjective; \"poeticality\" acceptable but use sparingly (prefer \"poetic stance\" or \"poetic mode\" as noun variants). Capitalize \"the Poetic\" in glossary, translator's introduction, and Essay 5 title; lowercase \"the poetic\" in running text. Capitalize on first occurrence per essay when introducing the concept, lowercase thereafter. Not to be confused with *poetics* (诗学, the study of poetry/literary theory).\n    96→\n    97→---\n    98→\n    99→## 梦境 (mengjing)\n   100→\n   101→- **Main translation**: dreamscape\n   102→- **Morphological link**: dream + -scape (= dream + 境); the 境 component is visible through the established -scape echo (see 境-family system above)\n   103→- **Alternatives**:\n   104→  - \"dream-realm\" (emphasizing spatial/bounded quality)\n   105→  - \"experiential milieu\" / \"meaning-field\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n   106→  - \"experiential environment\" / \"meaning-world\" (Existentialism)\n   107→- **Note**: All experts agree on \"dreamscape\" as the best main translation. The author explicitly states this is NOT just literal dreaming: \"任何感受都有使得他得以展现的'环境'\" (any feeling has an 'environment' that enables it to manifest). Examples: games, novels, rituals, relationships, daily life. The \"dream\" metaphor captures: (1) constructed/artificial character, (2) immersive quality, (3) capacity to evoke powerful experience despite being constructed. Chinese Philosophy expert recommends \"dream-realm\" as alternative to preserve both 梦 and 境 components. Buddhism expert notes the Diamond Sutra parallel: \"All conditioned phenomena are like a dream\" -- but the author's dreamscape is NOT illusion to be escaped; it is structure to be engaged with lucidly. The dreamscape is where meaning and feeling become \"two sides of one body.\" Wittgenstein expert: the immersed/lucid distinction resonates with the difference between being *within* a language game (as participants normally are) and being *aware* of the language game as a language game -- but the author's concept is richer: lucidity does not diminish engagement, whereas Wittgensteinian awareness typically implies philosophical detachment.\n   108→\n   109→---\n   110→\n   111→## 境界 (jingjie)\n   112→\n   113→- **Main translation**: bounds / horizon\n   114→- **Alternatives**:\n   115→  - \"realm\" (when used to mean a delimited domain)\n   116→  - \"domain\" (Phenomenology)\n   117→- **Relation to 境**: 境界 is a fixed compound where 境 and 界 are near-synonyms reinforcing each other (both mean boundary/limit/domain). It is NOT compositionally \"the 界 of 境.\" The -scape link does NOT apply — different compositional logic from 梦境 (where 境 is the formal core). See 境-family system in the 境 entry.\n   118→- **Occurrences**: Only in Essay 6 (范畴论与境 整理), lines 17-25. The author self-glosses 境界 as 界限 (limits/boundary) on first use (line 17).\n   119→- **Key moment (line 25)**: The author writes 境界 and bare 境 side by side — \"超越了静态的思想的*境界*（明日之**境**不同于今日之**境**）\" — distinguishing the static boundary (境界) from the evolving field (境). Multiple experts identified this as the \"moment of conceptual birth\" where 境 is liberated from 境界.\n   120→- **Translator's note**: One footnote at line 25 only (NO note at line 17). The note should explain: (1) 境界 shares the character 境 with Jing, (2) the author here separates what was a fused compound — the boundary drops away and the structured field stands alone, (3) this is the transitional moment from traditional to technical usage. Rationale for no note at line 17: at that point, Jing has not yet been introduced as a technical concept; a forward-reference would be noise. Let the reader encounter 境界 as ordinary \"bounds\" first, then witness the separation at line 25. (Decision: 5-5 expert split, author chose \"no\" side; chinese-phil-expert's linguistic argument was decisive — 境界 is a reinforcing compound, not \"boundary of Jing.\")\n   121→- **Note**: Distinguished from 境 (Jing). The author uses 境界 in its traditional sense: the bounds or horizon of a domain (language, thought). Phenomenology expert: parallel to Husserl's \"horizon\" (*Horizont*). Buddhism expert: carries both spatial sense (extent of domain) and soteriological sense (level of attainment). Do NOT confuse with the technical term 境 (Jing).\n   122→- **DISAGREEMENT**: RESOLVED. Previous split between \"boundary/horizon\" and \"realm\" — now resolved to \"bounds/horizon\" as default, following the author's own 界限 gloss. \"Realm\" acceptable only when emphasizing the domain rather than its limits.\n   123→\n   124→---\n   125→\n   126→## 非理性 (feilixing)\n   127→\n   128→- **Main translation**: the non-rational\n   129→- **Alternatives**:\n   130→  - \"non-rationality\" (nominal form)\n   131→  - \"arational\" (to avoid negative connotation of \"irrational\")\n   132→  - \"extra-rational\" (emphasizing beyond-reason)\n   133→  - \"beyond reason\" (discursive)\n   134→  - AVOID: \"irrational\" (has pejorative connotations; means \"contrary to reason\")\n   135→- **Note**: All nine experts agree this must NOT be translated as \"irrational.\" The author's argument: \"the purpose of reason must lie outside reason\" -- reason is a tool; its goals are non-rational. The pursuit of ultimate reality, the demand for constancy, the need for self-realization -- all are non-rational. This is NOT defective reasoning but a domain outside reason's reach. The author insists: \"this non-rationality should be acknowledged\" (承认). Epistemology expert: resolves the regress problem differently than foundationalism or coherentism -- the regress ends in non-rational commitment, which is accepted rather than disguised. Buddhism expert: parallels Buddhist *tanha* (craving), but Buddhism aims to overcome it while the author aims to recognize it and work with it lucidly. Kantian expert: departure from Kant, for whom reason's demand for the unconditioned is rational. Wittgenstein expert: corresponds to what cannot be *said* but only *shown* (Tractatus 4.1212, 6.522); the later Wittgenstein's insistence that reasons come to an end (PI §211, §217: \"This is simply what I do\") is also relevant -- justification bottoms out in non-rational action.\n   136→\n   137→---\n   138→\n   139→## 形而上 (xing er shang)\n   140→\n   141→- **Main translation**: the metaphysical (mass noun / domain)\n   142→- **Count noun form**: \"a metaphysical\" or \"a metaphysical construct\" (for specific instances)\n   143→- **Alternatives**:\n   144→  - \"meta-formation\" (Phenomenology)\n   145→  - \"supra-phenomenal\" (Kantian)\n   146→  - \"above-form\" (literal, archaic, use sparingly)\n   147→  - AVOID: \"metaphysical object\" — imports substance-ontology the author dismantles; collides with category-theoretic \"object\" (对象 in Obj_E)\n   148→- **Two grammatical modes** (unanimous, 10/10):\n   149→  - General / mass noun: **\"the metaphysical\"** — \"constancy is the core of the metaphysical\"\n   150→  - Count noun: **\"a metaphysical\"** or **\"a metaphysical construct\"** — \"a metaphysical m is an association in E\"\n   151→  - Follows convention: \"a universal,\" \"a particular,\" \"a conditional\"\n   152→- **Note**: All experts agree on the critical distinction: 形而上 (the metaphysical, as content/construct) vs. 形而上学 (metaphysics, as discipline). The author reinterprets 形 as 现象 (phenomena), making 形而上 literally \"that which is above/upon phenomena.\" In classical Chinese, 形而上 is a verbal-directional phrase (form + and-then + above) — it describes a direction/relation, not a thing. These are constructions we build upon phenomena that claim constancy/universality -- all Second Reality. The author's formal definition: \"a metaphysical m is an association in E, and m is a universal property in some subcategory of E.\" Note: the author's own English gloss at Essay 6 line 248 uses \"Metaphysics object of the third kind,\" but all experts recommend overriding this because \"object\" imports ontological weight the framework rejects. Chinese Philosophy expert emphasizes the author's claim that Chinese philosophy is mostly 有形而上而无形而上学 (has metaphysical frameworks but lacks systematic metaphysical inquiry). Wittgenstein expert: this is not \"structure\" in the Wittgensteinian sense of \"logical form\" (Tractatus); the author's 形而上 are *experiential* constructions. Use \"the metaphysical\" (substantive) consistently; never collapse with \"metaphysics\" (the discipline).\n   153→\n   154→---\n   155→\n   156→## 形而上学 (xing er shang xue)\n   157→\n   158→- **Main translation**: metaphysics (the discipline)\n   159→- **Alternatives**:\n   160→  - \"metaphysical inquiry\" (emphasizing investigative aspect)\n   161→  - \"the study of the metaphysical\" (when clarifying distinction from 形而上)\n   162→- **Note**: All experts agree. Derived from the *Yijing* phrase \"形而上者谓之道.\" The author carefully distinguishes this from 形而上. Western metaphysics seeks ultimate reality; Chinese thought more often operates within given metaphysical frameworks.

This designates phenomena (现象) as what we encounter first, epistemically and practically. CRITICAL: The author explicitly states (footnote 25) that this is a *name* (名称), not an ontological claim that phenomena are the \"most real\" stuff of reality. It designates epistemic-practical priority: phenomena are indubitable, cannot be bypassed, and are the necessary starting point. \"First\" means first in the order of access, not first in the order of being. Kantian expert: parallels Kant's \"empirical reality\" but precedes all transcendental constitution. Phenomenology expert: parallels Husserl's principle of principles. Wittgenstein expert: corresponds to \"What has to be accepted, the given, is -- so one could say -- forms of life\" (PI p. 226).

Consists of constructions we build upon phenomena -- the \"things\" we posit as persisting objects, the concepts we abstract, the frameworks we assemble. The objective world (客观世界) is explicitly called a \"model\" (模型) based on phenomena. The numbering indicates it is reached second, after phenomena. All metaphysical constructs live here. Whenever we articulate Zeroth Reality, the articulation itself becomes Second Reality. Wittgenstein expert: when we articulate Zeroth Reality, the articulation itself becomes Second Reality -- parallels Wittgenstein's idea that once we try to *say* what can only be *shown*, we produce constructions within the domain of the sayable.

This is what traditional metaphysics calls 终极实在 (ultimate reality) -- the Dao, the Unmoved Mover, God, the thing-in-itself. The \"zeroth\" numbering is philosophically loaded: it designates a structural placeholder we can never reach from within the system. Whenever articulated, it becomes Second Reality. Metaphysics expert: parallels Kant's unknowable thing-in-itself and Wittgenstein's \"what can be shown but not said.\" Buddhism expert: compares to Yogacara's *parinispanna* (consummate nature) but diverges because the author insists on in-principle inaccessibility. Kantian expert: mirrors Kant's *Grenzbegriff* (limiting concept). Wittgenstein expert: parallels the Tractatus's \"Not *how* the world is, is the mystical, but *that* it is\" (6.44) -- what cannot be said but only shown. AVOID: \"non-reality\" or \"zero reality\" (suggests non-existence rather than inaccessibility).

The three-fold schema (第〇/第一/第二实在) stratifies what counts as \"real\" according to epistemic access and constructive order.

The author explicitly invokes \"lucid dreaming\" as the metaphor. This is the stance enabled by recognizing the disenchantment of Zeroth Reality. Buddhism expert: parallels Chan awakening's third stage -- \"after enlightenment, mountains are mountains again.\" All experts agree \"lucid dreamscape\" perfectly captures the concept.\n   217→\n   218→---\n   219→\n   220→## 沉醉的梦境 (chenzui de mengjing)\n   221→\n   222→- **Main translation**: the intoxicated dreamscape\n   223→- **Alternatives**:\n   224→  - \"the entranced dreamscape\" (if \"intoxicated\" feels too strong)\n   225→- **Note**: Pre-metaphysical existence: being in a dreamscape without knowing you're in one. The author identifies this with belief/faith (信念/信仰) where purpose appears as logically groundless. After disenchantment (祛魅), one \"can no longer\" (无法再) be intoxicated — the loss of innocence is irreversible. Existentialism expert: corresponds to Sartre's *mauvaise foi* but the author is more generous — intoxication is not moral failing but the natural pre-nihilistic stance. The contrast \"intoxicated dreamscape\" vs. \"lucid dreamscape\" is the central pair of the 诗意 essay.\n   226→- **DISAGREEMENT**: RESOLVED (unanimous, 10/10 after debate). \"Intoxicated\" confirmed.

Describes the mode of inhabiting a dreamscape while aware it is constructed. Buddhism expert: carries overtones of Buddhist *bodhi* (awakening) but is epistemological rather than soteriological. Phenomenology expert: parallels Husserl's phenomenological attitude. Wittgenstein expert: corresponds to the philosophical moment of recognizing a language game *as* a language game, but without the Wittgensteinian consequence of therapeutic dissolution -- the author insists lucidity does not diminish engagement.

Only \"intoxicated\" marks the distinction.\n   247→- **Translator's note**: TN on first occurrence: \"沉醉 (chenzui, literally 'sunk-drunk'): epistemic condition of unknowing engagement — not a moral judgment, but the state of taking constructed meaning for given reality.\"\n   248→- **Note**: Engagement in a dreamscape without meta-awareness of its constructed nature. Literally \"sink-drunk\" (沉=sink, 醉=drunk). The author chose 沉醉 over neutral alternatives (沉浸, 投入, 专注) deliberately. The pejorative connotation is a feature, not a bug: it captures an epistemic deficit (not knowing you are in a dreamscape), not a moral failing. Buddhism expert: parallels Buddhist *mada* (intoxication/heedlessness, an upaklesha). Existentialism expert: maps onto Heidegger's *das Man* but is specifically a state one moves beyond (unlike Verfallen, which is structural). The key argument: \"intoxicated\" is the natural antonym of \"lucid\" along the axis of self-awareness. You can be lucid AND immersed (the poetic), but you cannot be lucid AND intoxicated (contradiction). This asymmetry is the engine of the 诗意 essay.\n   249→- **DISAGREEMENT**: RESOLVED (unanimous, 10/10 after debate — phil-mind and wittgenstein switched from \"immersed,\" phenomenology withdrew \"absorbed\"). \"Intoxicated\" as default. \"Absorbed\" and \"immersed\" reserved for contexts where the author uses 投入 or 沉浸 (shared by both dreamscape modes).\n   250→\n   251→---\n   252→\n   253→## 联想 (lianxiang)\n   254→\n   255→- **Main translation**: association\n   256→- **Alternatives**:\n   257→  - \"associative connection\" (when emphasizing relational character)\n   258→  - \"cognitive morphism\" (Philosophy of Mind, technical)\n   259→  - \"associative morphism\" (Phenomenology, technical)\n   260→- **Note**: All experts agree on \"association\" as the main translation. In the categorical framework, associations are the morphisms (arrows) connecting experiences within E. Crucially, associations are themselves experiences (感受), which is why E has tower structure. Phenomenology expert: carries the weight of Husserl's passive synthesis through association (*Assoziation*). Philosophy of Mind expert: adds composability -- if A associates to B and B to C, there is a determinate A-to-C association. Metaphysics expert: echoes Hume's \"association of ideas\" but is more structural. Chinese Philosophy expert warns that 联想 also means \"imagination\" in Chinese -- not the intended sense. Wittgenstein expert: no direct Wittgensteinian parallel, but the idea that the link *between* experiences is itself an experience has affinities with William James's stream of consciousness and Husserl's internal time-consciousness.\n   261→\n   262→---\n   263→\n   264→## 超越 (chaoyue)\n   265→\n   266→- **Main translation**: transcendence (noun) / to transcend (verb)\n   267→- **Alternatives**:\n   268→  - \"going-beyond\" (verbal, less technical)\n   269→  - \"surpass\" (when emphasizing exceeding limits)\n   270→- **Note**: The author uses this in multiple senses: (1) the traditional metaphysical quest for Zeroth Reality (a failed attempt at transcendence); (2) what lies outside the current boundary of thought; (3) immanent self-transformation through practice. True transcendence (reaching Zeroth Reality) is impossible, but dynamic transcendence (evolution of one's experiential sphere) is real. Kantian expert: author's usage is closer to Heidegger's *Uberstieg* than to Kant's transcendental method.

Key usage: \"one's own death is transcendent for oneself\" -- death is beyond the boundary of one's experiential sphere.

Non-negotiable.\n   291→- **Note**: All experts agree on the critical distinction from Buddhist 空 (emptiness/sunyata). The author's 虚无 is the void left when the highest values (ultimate reality) collapse -- not a positive entity but an absence. \"Nihilism is not a something, a doctrine, but a nothing, a void\" (后形而上学 整理, line 100: \"一种无，一种缺位\"). Chinese Philosophy expert: 虚 (empty, void) + 无 (nothing) -- simultaneously negative and cosmologically resonant (the Daoist productive void).

Kantian expert: parallels Kant's limitation of metaphysics but goes further -- accepts non-rationality at the foundation.

The author's framework is cautious about ontology. Existence is tied to presence in phenomena: something exists (for us) insofar as it appears in First Reality or is well-grounded in Second Reality. Existentialism expert: the author shifts from the question of Being to the structure of experiential fields. Phenomenology expert: when the author says phenomena \"存在,\" this is better translated as \"are present/given\" than \"exist\" in a metaphysical sense.

Romanized \"Dao\" would prevent this. The author uses 道 primarily in the 道德仁义礼 sequence analysis, showing it is GENERATED last through progressive generalization from phenomena, not given first as the primordial source. Chinese Philosophy expert: \"genuinely original -- no classical Chinese philosopher has argued that 道 itself is a cognitive construction built from phenomenal observation upward.\" Buddhism expert: parallels *dharma-kaya* or *tathata* but the author emphasizes inaccessibility through articulation.

Crucially, 德 applies to ALL things (凡事诸物皆有其德), not just moral agents — every entity has its \"character,\" the regularity that makes it what it is. This constructivist reading departs from both the standard Confucian sense (moral virtue) and the Daoist sense (natural potency). \"Character\" was chosen (7-3, then unanimous after debate) as lightweight, naturally universal (rocks and dogs have \"character\"), and preserving the constructivist ambiguity. Buddhism expert: parallels Buddhist *svabhava* (self-nature) but is relational/functional, not essential.\n   357→- **Translator's note (TN draft)**: \"The author reconceives 德 (de) not as virtue in the moral sense but as (constitutive) character — the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle.\"\n   358→- **DISAGREEMENT**: RESOLVED (9/9 unanimous final confirmation + translator). \"(Constitutive) character\" as main rendering; \"virtue\" only in classical block quotes; shift between the two enacts the author's argument.\n   359→\n   360→---\n   361→\n   362→## 本质 (benzhi)\n   363→\n   364→- **Main translation**: essence / essential nature\n   365→- **Alternatives**:\n   366→  - \"nature\" (less technical)\n   367→  - \"whatness\" (technical, echoing scholastic *quidditas*)\n   368→- **Note**: In the author's post-metaphysical framework, \"essence\" is reinterpreted: not a hidden inner nature but the universal property of a stable subcategory in E.

This provides a structural, non-substantialist account of self. Philosophy of Mind expert: aligns with Buddhist Abhidharma analysis (self as conventional designation), Hume's bundle theory, and narrative self theories. Buddhism expert: \"remarkable convergence\" -- the definition IS the Middle Way on self (not eternalism, not nihilism). Chinese Philosophy expert: resonates with Buddhist 无我 (no-self) but approached phenomenologically. Wittgenstein expert: compatible with Wittgenstein's anti-Cartesianism -- \"I\" is not a substance but a structural position (cf.

Tied to practice and the overlap of ideal and phenomenon: \"we see ourselves in phenomena, confirm my existence, make phenomena become 'part of me.'\" Echoes Hegel's *Selbstverwirklichung* and Marxist self-realization through labor. \"Self-realization\" captures the making-real better than \"self-actualization.\"\n   421→\n   422→---\n   423→\n   424→## 意义 (yiyi)\n   425→\n   426→- **Main translation**: meaning / significance\n   427→- **Alternatives**:\n   428→  - \"significance\" (when emphasizing weight)\n   429→  - \"sense\" (when emphasizing intelligibility)\n   430→  - \"purpose\" (when teleological dimension is primary)\n   431→- **Note**: Central to the author's argument: meaning and feeling are \"two sides of one body\" (两面一体). Meaning IS felt experience. The author: \"I boldly surmise that meaning and purpose are in fact the surging of sensibility, the crystallization of experience.\" The attempt to seek meaning externally (向外寻求意义) is the category error that generates absurdity. Existentialism expert: connects to Heidegger's *Befindlichkeit* but is more radical -- meaning cannot be separated from affect. Wittgenstein expert: closer to Wittgenstein's meaning-as-use than to Frege's *Sinn*/*Bedeutung* or truth-conditional accounts. In some contexts (especially 后形而上学), 意义 operates more as \"purpose\" or \"significance-for-a-life\"; context should guide the choice between \"meaning\" and \"significance.\"\n   432→\n   433→---\n   434→\n   435→## 理解 (lijie)\n   436→\n   437→- **Main translation**: understanding / to understand\n   438→- **Alternatives**:\n   439→  - \"comprehension\"\n   440→- **Note**: The author formalizes understanding as a natural transformation between two functorial evolutions: the evolution of a structure and the evolution of one's experience. You understand something when these align coherently. Philosophy of Mind expert: \"revolutionary account\" -- understanding is not correspondence between mind and world but alignment between internal simulation and external structure. Epistemology expert: dissolves the understanding/explanation distinction. Broader than 掌握 (mastery) -- there is a gradient. Wittgenstein expert: parallels Wittgenstein's *Verstehen* -- \"But how does the understanding manifest itself?\" Wittgenstein answers in terms of ability (PI §154: the ability to go on); the author's natural transformation η can be read as a formalization of this ability. \"Understanding\" is the right translation; \"comprehension\" is too cognitive.\n   441→\n   442→---\n   443→\n   444→## 掌握 (zhangwo)\n   445→\n   446→- **Main translation**: mastery / to grasp\n   447→- **Alternatives**:\n   448→  - \"command\" (emphasizing full competence)\n   449→  - \"complete understanding\"\n   450→- **Note**: Technical term in the natural transformation analysis. To \"grasp\" a formula means the natural transformation component is the identity morphism -- no gap between your derivation and the truth. Epistemology expert: \"a phenomenological notion of knowledge.\" Philosophy of Mind expert: explains why some correct computations don't feel like mastery and why mastery persists across contexts. Wittgenstein expert: Wittgenstein's \"knowing how to go on\" (PI §151) is closer to 理解 than to 掌握; the latter's directness and immediacy has more affinity with Husserl's *Evidenz*. Recommends \"mastery\" for general use, \"direct grasp\" for philosophically precise contexts.\n   451→\n   452→---\n   453→\n   454→## 知识 (zhishi)\n   455→\n   456→- **Main translation**: knowledge\n   457→- **Alternatives**:\n   458→  - \"belief taken to be correct\" (when emphasizing author's deflationary analysis)\n   459→- **Note**: Epistemology expert: the author radically redefines knowledge by collapsing the JTB (Justified True Belief) tripartite analysis. Through the \"access argument,\" truth and justification both reduce to belief in practice. More radical than post-Gettier externalism -- dissolves the knowledge/belief distinction entirely at the practical level. Wittgenstein expert: aligns with certain readings of *On Certainty* (Moyal-Sharrock's \"animal certainty\") but goes further -- Wittgenstein preserves the grammar of \"knowing\" even while transforming its philosophical significance. The author's thesis is deflationary.\n   460→\n   461→---\n   462→\n   463→## 信念 (xinnian)\n   464→\n   465→- **Main translation**: belief\n   466→- **Alternatives**:\n   467→  - \"doxastic state\" (technical epistemological contexts)\n   468→  - \"conviction\" (when emphasizing strength)\n   469→- **Note**: Central to the author's dissolution of JTB. Defined as \"a thought of taking something as true,\" inherently subjective. The author argues all justification reduces to belief (belief-about-belief). Epistemology expert: the Chinese 信念 carries stronger connotations of conviction than English \"belief.\" Wittgenstein expert: Wittgenstein's *On Certainty* distinguishes between beliefs (which can be doubted) and hinge propositions (which cannot be meaningfully doubted); the author's usage is closer to the ordinary sense.\n   470→\n   471→---\n   472→\n   473→## 真理 (zhenli)\n   474→\n   475→- **Main translation**: truth\n   476→- **Alternatives**:\n   477→  - \"objective truth\" (when distinguishing from subjective belief)\n   478→- **Note**: The author's treatment is deflationary and access-focused. \"Truth\" in JTB refers to objective truth, but the author argues this is \"methodologically impossible\" to access. Not anti-realism (no ontological claim) but truth is \"inoperative\" in knowledge formation.\n   479→\n   480→---\n   481→\n   482→## 辩护 / 证成 (biànhù / zhèngchéng)\n   483→\n   484→- **Main translation**: justification\n   485→- **Alternatives**:\n   486→  - \"warrant\" (emphasizing epistemic entitlement)\n   487→  - \"verification relation\" (in categorical framework)\n   488→- **Note**: Epistemology expert: the author's central thesis is that justification reduces to belief. All justification bases collapse into belief when we ask how we access them. In the K1 framework, verification relations are morphisms in the knowledge category.\n   489→\n   490→---\n   491→\n   492→## 理性 (lixing)\n   493→\n   494→- **Main translation**: reason / rationality\n   495→- **Alternatives**:\n   496→  - \"the rational\" (as substantive, contrasted with non-rational)\n   497→  - \"rational faculty\" (when emphasizing Kant's *Vernunft*)\n   498→- **Note**: The author argues reason is a *tool* (工具) whose purposes are non-rational. Kantian expert: this deflates reason from its Kantian status as source of necessary structures and regulative ideals. Epistemology expert: rational justification cannot justify itself without circularity, so rationality's value is non-rationally grounded.\n   499→\n   500→---\n   501→\n   502→## 先验 (xianyan)\n   503→\n   504→- **Main translation**: a priori / transcendental (context-dependent)\n   505→- **Alternatives**:\n   506→  - \"a priori\" (knowledge independent of experience)\n   507→  - \"transcendental\" (conditions of possibility of experience)\n   508→- **Note**: The author's treatment is carefully agnostic. Stable structures S_E preserved under evolution *might* include a priori elements if identified at the earliest cognitive stage. But this is *descriptive*, not transcendental deduction. Kantian expert: \"the form of synthetic a priori knowledge, but the content left to empirical investigation.\" Epistemology expert: naturalizes the a priori.\n   509→\n   510→---\n   511→\n   512→## 综合 (zonghe)\n   513→\n   514→- **Main translation**: synthesis / synthetic\n   515→- **Alternatives**:\n   516→  - \"integration\" (emphasizing unification)\n   517→- **Note**: Used in contexts about how elements are combined to form higher-level structures. Kantian expert: the author extends Kant's synthetic a priori from mathematics to the domain of meaning. The framework suggests all knowledge is synthetic (constructed from experiential materials).\n   518→\n   519→---\n   520→\n   521→## 体验 (tiyan)\n   522→\n   523→- **Main translation**: experience (processual/immersive)\n   524→- **Alternatives**:\n   525→  - \"lived experience\" (Husserlian contexts only — use sparingly; see AVOID note under 感受)\n   526→  - \"Erlebnis\" (scholarly, Husserlian)\n   527→  - \"experiential content\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n   528→- **Note**: The author explicitly equates 体验 with 感受 for referring to parts of P (范畴论与境, line 166), but in practice 体验 leans active/processual/durational while 感受 leans passive/receptive. Closest to Husserl's *Erlebnis*. Kantian expert: closer to Husserl's *Erlebnis* or Dilthey's *Erleben*. Chinese Philosophy expert: emphasizes the \"living-through\" quality. Per the 感受 resolution: AVOID \"lived experience\" as default — too Husserlian, imports *Erlebnis* connotations the author does not invoke. Note: shares \"experience\" with 经验; see disambiguation rule under 经验 entry.\n   529→\n   530→---\n   531→\n   532→## 经验 (jingyan)\n   533→\n   534→- **Main translation**: experience (accumulated/epistemic)\n   535→- **Convention**: Use plain \"experience\" as default. When 经验 appears as adjective/modifier, use \"experiential\" (经验结构 = experiential structure, 经验形态 = experiential forms). Adjectival 经验性的 → \"empirical.\" When 经验 and 体验 co-occur in proximity, 经验 takes \"experiential\" (adjectival) or \"empirical experience\" (nominal) to disambiguate from 体验 (\"experience\").\n   536→- **Alternatives**:\n   537→  - \"experiential\" (adjectival form — 经验结构, 经验形态)\n   538→  - \"empirical experience\" (disambiguation variant when 体验 is nearby)\n   539→  - \"empirical\" (for 经验性的)\n   540→  - \"Erfahrung\" (scholarly, contrasting with *Erlebnis*)\n   541→- **Note**: NEVER synonymous with 感受. Refers to accumulated, reflected-upon, epistemological experience — closer to Husserl's *Erfahrung* as opposed to *Erlebnis* (体验). Used in section headers \"经验的总结/预测/抽象\" (summary/prediction/abstraction of experience) and as adjective \"经验性的\" (empirical). In practice, 经验 and 体验 rarely appear in the same sentence; context disambiguates. Kantian expert: Kant's *Erfahrung* — structured, unified cognition of phenomena. Philosophy of Mind expert: marks the boundary between a priori and empirical. Expert vote: 10/10 unanimous confirmation of \"experience\" as main with proximity disambiguation rule.\n   542→\n   543→---\n   544→\n   545→## 意识 (yishi)\n   546→\n   547→- **Main translation**: consciousness\n   548→- **Alternatives**:\n   549→  - \"awareness\" (when emphasizing attentional aspect)\n   550→- **Note**: Philosophy of Mind expert: in the framework, consciousness is the phenomenal field P from which 境 structures are constructed. This aligns with phenomenal consciousness (what-it's-like-ness). Phenomenology expert: when the author discusses 清醒 (lucid), this relates to reflective consciousness.\n   551→\n   552→---\n   553→\n   554→## 认知 (renzhi)\n   555→\n   556→- **Main translation**: cognition / cognitive structure\n   557→- **Alternatives**:\n   558→  - \"epistemic structure\" (when knowledge-focused)\n   559→- **Note**: The framework distinguishes consciousness (意识, phenomenal field P) from cognition (认知, the category-theoretic structure 境 built upon P). Philosophy of Mind expert: aligns with embodied cognition and enactivism.\n   560→\n   561→---\n   562→\n   563→## 范畴 (fanchou)\n   564→\n   565→- **Main translation**: category\n   566→- **Alternatives**:\n   567→  - \"范畴论\" = \"category theory\" (the mathematical discipline)\n   568→- **Translator's note**: TN at first occurrence of 范畴论 (8/10 majority): \"Category theory (范畴论) here refers to the mathematical discipline (Eilenberg-Mac Lane), not to Kant's table of categories (Kategorien), though the author's use of the term is alive to both senses.\" Frame as connection, never as warning. The Chinese term 范畴 bridges both the Kantian and mathematical senses; the author deliberately exploits this.\n   569→- **Note**: Dual usage: (1) Kantian categories (pure concepts of understanding), (2) mathematical category theory (objects and morphisms). The author primarily uses sense (2) but the philosophical overlap with sense (1) is intentional. Kantian expert: the author replaces Kant's table of categories with category-theoretic structures -- universal properties replace categories, functors replace schematism, natural transformations replace synthetic unity of apperception.\n   570→\n   571→---\n   572→\n   573→## 泛性质 / 范性质 (fan xingzhi)\n   574→\n   575→- **Main translation**: universal property\n   576→- **Alternatives**: None (standard mathematical terminology)\n   577→- **Note**: From category theory. An object with universal property is characterized by its relationships to all other objects. The author uses this philosophically: universal properties in subcategories of E correspond to what we experience as \"essences\" -- this relocates essence from intrinsic nature to categorical position, from substance to structure. Kantian expert: formalizes what Kant called the \"schema\" of a concept. Wittgenstein expert: offers a structural account of what Wittgenstein calls \"family resemblance\" (PI §67) -- a universal property need not be a shared feature but rather a structural position (terminal or initial object) that relates to all objects in the category.\n   578→\n   579→---\n   580→\n   581→## 塔式结构 (ta shi jiegou)\n   582→\n   583→- **Main translation**: tower structure\n   584→- **Alternatives**: None needed\n   585→- **Note**: A category where morphisms are also objects, creating ascending levels. E has tower structure because associations (morphisms) are themselves experiences (objects). Formalized as T_0 -> T_1 -> T_2 -> ... -> T_infinity. Philosophy of Mind expert: provides formal model for meta-cognition and higher-order thought. Kantian expert: related to Fichte's reflexive self-positing.\n   586→\n   587→---\n   588→\n   589→## 基石 (jishi)\n   590→\n   591→- **Main translation**: base stone / foundation stone\n   592→- **Alternatives**:\n   593→  - \"base object\" (more technical)\n   594→  - \"starting point\"\n   595→- **Note**: In the tower-structure construction, base stones are objects designated as foundational. Choosing different base stones gives different \"constructions\" and thus different \"metaphysics.\" The metaphor of \"stone\" suggests solidity/foundation.\n   596→\n   597→---\n   598→\n   599→## 元阶 (yuan jie)\n   600→\n   601→- **Main translation**: meta-order\n   602→- **Alternatives**:\n   603→  - \"order\" (when clear from context)\n   604→- **Note**: Technical term from the tower-structure construction. An object's \"absolute meta-order\" is which level it first appears; \"relative meta-order\" is defined relative to a chosen base stone. The 道德仁义礼 examples show how the same subcategory can be assigned different meta-orders depending on construction direction.\n   605→\n   606→---\n   607→\n   608→## 态射 / 箭头 (taishe / jiantou)\n   609→\n   610→- **Main translation**: morphism / arrow\n   611→- **Alternatives**:\n   612→  - \"mapping\" (less technical)\n   613→- **Note**: Standard category theory terms. In the framework, morphisms are associations (联想) between experiences. Philosophy of Mind expert: \"morphisms are as ontologically basic as mental contents.\" The arrows-only formulation collapses the distinction between objects and morphisms at the fundamental level.\n   614→\n   615→---\n   616→\n   617→## 函子 (hanzi)\n   618→\n   619→- **Main translation**: functor\n   620→- **Alternatives**: None (technical term)\n   621→- **Note**: Structure-preserving map between categories. Key applications: evolution functor T: E_t -> E_{t+1} (cognitive development/change); inclusion functors (embedding subcategories); translation functors (mapping between domains). Kantian expert: \"the author's major methodological innovation beyond Kant -- Kant's framework is static; the author introduces dynamics via functors.\" Wittgenstein expert: the evolution of E corresponds to changes in one's form of life over time -- something Wittgenstein acknowledges but does not formalize.\n   622→\n   623→---\n   624→\n   625→## 自然变换 (ziran bianhua)\n   626→\n   627→- **Main translation**: natural transformation\n   628→- **Alternatives**: None (technical term)\n   629→- **Note**: The author's formalization of understanding (理解). A natural transformation between the evolution of formal structures and the evolution of experience is the condition of understanding. When the component is the identity morphism, this is mastery (掌握). Kantian expert: \"formalizes the schematism and extends it to meaning, aesthetics, and all understanding.\" Philosophy of Mind expert: \"meaning is neither in text/world nor in mind, but in the natural transformation between them.\" Wittgenstein expert: the key innovation is interpreting the component η_a as an *experience* -- the felt sense of confirmation or understanding. This bridges formal category theory and phenomenology. Always translate as \"natural transformation\" and preserve mathematical notation.\n   630→\n   631→---\n   632→\n   633→## 稳定结构 (wending jiegou)\n   634→\n   635→- **Main translation**: stable structure\n   636→- **Alternatives**:\n   637→  - \"invariant structure\" (mathematical contexts)\n   638→  - \"structural invariant\"\n   639→- **Note**: The structure S_E preserved under the evolution functor T. Formal counterpart to constancy (恒常). The author conjectures: there exists S_E such that T(S_E) is isomorphic to S_E. Kantian expert: corresponds to Kant's forms of intuition and categories but discovered empirically rather than deduced a priori. Wittgenstein expert: corresponds to the \"very general facts of nature\" (PI p. 230) and to hinge propositions (*On Certainty*) that form the stable framework of our world-picture.\n   640→\n   641→---\n   642→\n   643→## 稳定子范畴 (wending zi fanchou)\n   644→\n   645→- **Main translation**: stable subcategory\n   646→- **Alternatives**: None\n   647→- **Note**: The author conjectures that universal properties in stable subcategories of E correspond to what we experience as \"essences.\" Part of the formal apparatus that \"runs ahead of its interpretation.\"\n   648→\n   649→---\n   650→\n   651→## 认知结构 (renzhi jiegou)\n   652→\n   653→- **Main translation**: cognitive structure\n   654→- **Alternatives**:\n   655→  - \"epistemic structure\"\n   656→- **Note**: Kantian expert: if part of the stable structure is shown to be necessary for constructing any E from P, it may be called \"cognitive structure\" -- this is a transcendental argument formalized categorically.\n   657→\n   658→---\n   659→\n   660→## 道 / 德 / 仁 / 义 / 礼 Sequence\n   661→\n   662→**Status**: RESOLVED (9/9 unanimous + translator, confirmed in Essay 4 draft review).\n   663→\n   664→**Convention**: 仁/义/礼 use our dictionary terms consistently throughout — NO split between block quote and analysis (unlike 德, which splits).

Chinese Philosophy expert recommends \"humaneness\" over \"benevolence\" (too external/active). The author distinguishes 现象仁 (the inner feeling directed toward the other) from the theoretical concept. \"Humaneness\" captures the experiential, empathetic dimension and preserves the connection to what-it-is-to-be-human (crucial for the property→definition reversal).

Two subjects are intersubjectively aligned when their respective natural transformations satisfy the same naturality conditions -- i.e., when their experiential responses are structurally constrained by the same categorical diagrams. The private content of experience drops out as irrelevant (cf. Wittgenstein's beetle-in-the-box, PI §293); what matters is structural position. Wittgenstein expert: this is perhaps the author's most significant contribution to the intersubjectivity problem -- not grounded in empathy (Husserl), communicative rationality (Habermas), or agreement in form of life (Wittgenstein), but in structural commensurability. In passages where the structural mechanism is foregrounded, \"structural commensurability\" may be clearer than \"intersubjectivity.\"\n   803→\n   804→---\n   805→\n   806→## 意向性 (yixiangxing)\n   807→\n   808→- **Main translation**: intentionality\n   809→- **Alternatives**: None\n   810→- **Note**: Husserl's *Intentionalitat*.

We can only think about what is in the basket. Engages with Colin McGinn's cognitive closure thesis.\n   830→\n   831→---\n   832→\n   833→## 自上而下 / 自下而上 (zì shàng ér xià / zì xià ér shàng)\n   834→\n   835→- **Main translation**: top-down / bottom-up\n   836→- **Alternatives**: None needed\n   837→- **Note**: Standard translations.

The author insists non-rationality \"should be acknowledged\" -- this is the pivot from nihilism to the poetic. Parallels Buddhist *yatha-bhuta* (seeing as it really is) but with different endpoint: lucid engagement rather than liberation.\n   846→\n   847→---\n   848→\n   849→## 空 (kong)\n   850→\n   851→- **Main translation**: emptiness (Buddhist, *sunyata*)\n   852→- **Alternatives**: \"void,\" \"vacuity\"\n   853→- **Note**: Buddhism expert: CRITICAL -- do NOT conflate with 虚无 (nihilistic void). Buddhist emptiness means absence of *svabhava* (inherent existence), not absence of phenomena. The author rarely uses 空 in technical Buddhist sense. When it appears, maintain strict distinction from 虚无.\n   854→\n   855→---\n   856→\n   857→## 无常 (wuchang)\n   858→\n   859→- **Main translation**: impermanence\n   860→- **Alternatives**: \"impermanent\" (adjectival), \"transience\"\n   861→- **Note**: Buddhist technical term (*anitya*). The author focuses on 恒常 (constancy) as the metaphysical drive rather than asserting impermanence. Buddhism expert: notable absence -- the author approaches from the phenomenology of our pursuit of stability.\n   862→\n   863→---\n   864→\n   865→## 缘起 (yuanqi)\n   866→\n   867→- **Main translation**: dependent origination\n   868→- **Alternatives**: \"conditioned arising,\" \"interdependent co-arising\"\n   869→- **Note**: Buddhism expert: though the term rarely appears explicitly, the author's core move embodies it. Objects are defined by morphisms (relations), not intrinsic content -- this is formal expression of *pratityasamutpada*. The tower structure resonates with Hua-yen's *shishi wuai* (interpenetration).\n   870→\n   871→---\n   872→\n   873→## 自性 (zixing)\n   874→\n   875→- **Main translation**: self-nature / inherent existence\n   876→- **Alternatives**: \"intrinsic nature,\" \"*svabhava*\" (transliterated)\n   877→- **Note**: Buddhism expert: Madhyamaka's target. The author rejects internal essences in favor of relational definition, recapitulating the Buddhist rejection of *svabhava* without using the term.\n   878→\n   879→---\n   880→\n   881→## 无我 (wuwo)\n   882→\n   883→- **Main translation**: non-self\n   884→- **Alternatives**: \"no-self,\" \"selflessness\" (ethical), \"*anatman*\" (transliterated)\n   885→- **Note**: Buddhism expert: core Buddhist doctrine. The author rarely uses this term explicitly but the category-theoretic definition of 我 (as universal property, not substance) functionally embodies the *anatman* teaching.\n   886→\n   887→---\n   888→\n   889→## P / E (Formal Symbols)\n   890→\n   891→- **Main translation**: P / E (retain letters)\n   892→- **Gloss**: P = \"the phenomenal field\" or \"the totality of phenomena\"; E = \"Jing\" or \"the structured experiential field\"\n   893→- **Note**: Retain in translation. P stands for Phenomenon, Physical World, Physics. E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, Experience. Full totality written in Fraktur (blackletter) script. Retain all formal notation.\n   894→\n   895→---\n   896→\n   897→## 语言游戏 (yuyan youxi)\n   898→\n   899→- **Main translation**: language game(s)\n   900→- **Alternatives**:\n   901→  - \"language-game(s)\" (hyphenated, following Anscombe/Hacker translations of Wittgenstein)\n   902→  - AVOID: \"linguistic game(s)\" (non-standard)\n   903→- **Note**: Standard translation of Wittgenstein's *Sprachspiel(e)* (PI §7 ff.). The author uses this term explicitly in K1策略 but with a crucial difference: for Wittgenstein, language games are the irreducible unit of meaning -- the bedrock. For the author, language games are a *method* for discovering stable structures (S_L) that can be mapped onto experiential structures (S_E). Preserve \"language games\" since the author deliberately invokes the Wittgensteinian concept; add translator's note on first occurrence explaining the methodological reorientation. The hyphenated \"language-game\" signals closer fidelity to the Wittgensteinian original.\n   904→\n   905→---\n   906→\n   907→## 哲学治疗 (zhexue zhiliao)\n   908→\n   909→- **Main translation**: philosophical therapy\n   910→- **Alternatives**:\n   911→  - \"philosophical therapeutics\" (formal)\n   912→- **Note**: Standard rendering of the late Wittgenstein's conception of philosophy as therapy (PI §133, §255). The author uses this in K1策略 to describe a process whose effectiveness the framework aims to *explain* structurally (through resolution of categorical tension / 张力). For Wittgenstein, philosophical therapy does not *have* an explanation -- it simply works when one achieves the \"perspicuous presentation\" (*ubersichtliche Darstellung*). Use \"philosophical therapy\" without qualification; the departure from Wittgenstein is explained in context.\n   913→\n   914→---\n   915→\n   916→## 结构 (jiegou)\n   917→\n   918→- **Main translation**: structure\n   919→- **Alternatives**:\n   920→  - \"categorical structure\" (in formal/category-theoretic contexts)\n   921→- **Note**: \"Structure\" is standard and unproblematic. However, the author's use is technical: it refers to the categorical structure (objects + morphisms + composition) that E embodies. This is not \"structure\" in the structuralist linguistic sense (Saussure, Chomsky) nor in the Wittgensteinian sense of \"logical form\" (Tractatus). The author's structures are *experiential*. In contexts where the formal sense is paramount, \"categorical structure\" is clearer.\n   922→\n   923→---\n   924→\n   925→## 规则 (guize)\n   926→\n   927→- **Main translation**: rule(s)\n   928→- **Alternatives**:\n   929→  - \"norm(s)\" (social/linguistic contexts)\n   930→  - \"invariant\" / \"stable structure\" (when the author's structural sense is dominant)\n   931→- **Note**: The author's \"rules\" are stable structures (S_E, S_L) preserved under functorial evolution -- closer to mathematical symmetries than to Wittgensteinian rules-as-practices. Wittgenstein argues rules do not determine their own application (PI §§185--202); the author's rules, as functorial invariants, are in a sense self-determining. When discussing linguistic or epistemic rules (语法规则 etc.), \"rule\" is standard. In category-theoretic contexts, \"invariant\" or \"stable structure\" may be more accurate.\n   932→\n   933→---\n   934→\n   935→## 演化 (yanhua)\n   936→\n   937→- **Main translation**: evolution\n   938→- **Alternatives**:\n   939→  - \"development\" (less technical)\n   940→  - \"temporal progression\"\n   941→- **Note**: Used for the evolution functor T_t: E_t → E_{t+1}. \"Evolution\" captures both temporal progression and structural transformation. Note that t is not necessarily physical time. In Wittgensteinian terms, the evolution of E corresponds to changes in one's form of life over time -- something Wittgenstein acknowledges but does not formalize.\n   942→\n   943→---\n   944→\n   945→## 张力 (zhangli)\n   946→\n   947→- **Main translation**: tension\n   948→- **Alternatives**:\n   949→  - \"strain\" / \"irresolution\"\n   950→- **Note**: The author defines 张力 as the state where a subcategory lacks a unique terminal object -- where multiple potential universal properties compete without resolution. This is a structural account of philosophical puzzlement, indecision, and existential unease. In Wittgensteinian terms, corresponds to being \"entangled in our own rules\" (PI §125) or \"held captive by a picture\" (PI §115). \"Tension\" is adequate and standard.\n   951→\n   952→---\n   953→\n   954→## 内省 (neisheng)\n   955→\n   956→- **Main translation**: introspection\n   957→- **Alternatives**:\n   958→  - \"self-examination\"\n   959→  - \"inner observation\"\n   960→- **Note**: The author uses 内省 as a methodological tool: one can \"verify\" the categorical structure E through introspection -- by checking whether structural relationships match one's felt experience. Wittgenstein is deeply suspicious of introspection as philosophical method (PI §580: \"An 'inner process' stands in need of outward criteria\"). However, the author's use is more sophisticated: it is not about accessing private objects but about verifying structural positions, which are in principle publicly describable. This is compatible with Wittgenstein's insistence on public criteria.\n   961→\n   962→---\n   963→\n   964→## 哲学实验 (zhexue shiyan)\n   965→\n   966→- **Main translation**: philosophical experiment\n   967→- **Alternatives**:\n   968→  - \"experiential experiment\"\n   969→  - \"phenomenological experiment\"\n   970→- **Note**: The author's term for constructing examples with specific categorical structures to awaken specific experiences in readers/participants, then checking whether those experiences are replicable and occupy the predicted structural positions. The essays themselves function as philosophical experiments. No direct Wittgensteinian equivalent, but parallels Wittgenstein's use of examples as philosophical method (PI §593) and Austin's method of constructing speech-act scenarios. Key difference: the author proposes *designing experiments in advance* based on categorical structure, whereas Wittgenstein finds examples therapeutically.\n   971→\n   972→---\n   973→\n   974→## 对齐 (duiqi)\n   975→\n   976→- **Main translation**: alignment\n   977→- **Alternatives**:\n   978→  - \"correspondence\"\n   979→  - \"attunement\" (Heideggerian contexts)\n   980→  - \"concordance\"\n   981→- **Note**: Describes the relationship between structural evolution and experiential evolution when a natural transformation exists. \"Alignment\" is clear and non-technical. \"Attunement\" (*Stimmung*) has Heideggerian resonances that may be appropriate in some contexts. In Wittgensteinian terms, corresponds to the state of being \"at home\" in a language game -- when one's responses naturally fit the game's structure.\n   982→\n   983→---\n   984→\n   985→## Additional Minor Terms\n   986→\n   987→### 天 (tian)\n   988→- **Main translation**: Heaven (cosmological) / Nature (in compounds)\n   989→- **Note**: Rarely used as technical term by the author.

Phil-mind and wittgenstein switched from \"immersed\"; phenomenology withdrew \"absorbed.\" Decisive argument: the author uses 投入 (engagement) and 沉浸 (immersion) for the LUCID dreamscape, so absorption/immersion is shared by both states. Only \"intoxicated\" marks the asymmetry — you can be lucid AND immersed, but not lucid AND intoxicated.

Wittgenstein / Philosophy of Language\n\n**Date:** 2026-02-10\n**Purpose:** This is the authoritative reference document for the English translation of the **Jing Ji** (境集) collection. It synthesizes recommendations from all nine expert perspectives into a single consensus dictionary, preserving expert agreement, flagging disagreements, and providing the translator with clear guidance for every key term. Terms are ordered by importance and frequency of use in the essays.\n\n**How to Use This Dictionary:**\n- Each entry shows the consensus translation (or best-judgment call where experts disagree).\n- The **DISAGREEMENT** line appears only when experts propose genuinely different main translations. Stylistic variations (e.g., capitalization) are noted under Alternatives, not flagged as disagreements.\n- Notes synthesize insights from all relevant experts. The goal is to give the translator maximum context in minimum space.\n- A Disagreements Summary at the end collects all disputed terms for the author's review.\n\n---\n\n## 境 (jing)\n\n- **Main translation**: Jing (romanized, as technical term)\n- **Morphological echo**: -scape (established in footnote on first introduction; see 境-family system below)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"E\" (in formal/category-theoretic passages, as the author uses)\n  - \"experiential realm\" (discursive contexts)\n  - \"experiential field\" / \"experiential milieu\" (Phenomenology)\n  - \"cognitive-scape\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"sphere\" (Metaphysics, in literary contexts)\n- **Note**: This is the single most important and most difficult term in the entire collection. All nine experts agree it resists single-word translation. The author defines it as a category-theoretic structure on phenomena (P): objects are selected experiences (感受), morphisms are associations (联想), and morphisms are also objects (tower structure). It evolves dynamically via functors. The term resonates with Buddhist *visaya*/*gocara* (object-domain of consciousness), Husserl's Lebenswelt, Heidegger's Welt, and the Chinese aesthetic tradition of 意境. The author considers alternative names: \"game, book, adventure, small world, small freedom.\" Seven of nine experts recommend keeping \"Jing\" transliterated with an explanatory apparatus on first use; two suggest descriptive glosses (\"experiential field,\" \"scape\"). Do NOT collapse into traditional Buddhist 境界 (spiritual attainment) or aesthetic 意境 -- the author's usage is formally precise. Wittgenstein expert: closest Wittgensteinian concept is \"form of life\" (*Lebensform*), but 境 is more individualistic and formalized; *Lebenswelt* is proximate but more communal. Recommends transliterating as *jing* with extensive initial gloss. Use \"Jing\" consistently, with \"E\" in mathematical/formal passages.\n- **境-family system** (unanimous resolution, all 9 experts + translator):\n  - **境** → Jing (standalone central technical term)\n  - **梦境** → dreamscape (dream + -scape; a type of Jing)\n  - **境界** → bounds / horizon (Jing + boundary; the limits of a Jing — NOT -scape)\n  - **境集** → Jing Ji (title, romanized)\n  - **-scape = 境**: Established in a footnote on first introduction of Jing. The English suffix \"-scape\" (as in landscape, dreamscape) serves as 境's approximate morphological echo: just as a landscape is the structured expanse of land as seen from a standpoint, Jing is a structured experiential space as lived from within. Chinese compounds containing 境 correspond to English \"-scape\" formations: thus 梦境 (dream-境) becomes \"dreamscape.\"\n\n---\n\n## 现象 (xianxiang)\n\n- **Main translation**: phenomena (plural) / phenomenon (singular)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the phenomenal\" (when used substantively for the field as a whole)\n  - \"phenomenal given\" (emphasizing givenness, Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"appearance\" (only with strong caveat -- see note)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on \"phenomena\" as main translation. The author uses this term with full phenomenological weight, closer to Husserl's *Phanomen* than to Kant's *Erscheinung*. Phenomena are NOT \"mere appearances\" behind which a truer reality hides; they are the indubitable ground of all experience, identified with \"all feelings taken together\" (全部的感受之总和). Phenomena = First Reality (第一实在). This includes sensory input AND the associations/connections between them. The author explicitly states: \"any understanding we have of phenomena is based on phenomena.\" Buddhism expert notes the parallel with Yogacara: 境 is *vijnapti-matra* (appearance-only). Epistemology expert emphasizes: this is \"practical phenomenalism\" -- whether or not things exist beyond phenomena, only phenomena serve as starting points for justification. AVOID translating as \"appearances\" without caveat, as this risks suggesting phenomena are merely apparent. Wittgenstein expert: \"phenomena\" does not play a central systematic role in Wittgenstein, though he discusses \"phenomenological\" language in *Remarks on Colour* and *Philosophical Remarks*. \"Phenomenon/phenomena\" is standard and adequate.\n\n---\n\n## 感受 (ganshou)\n\n- **Main translation**: feeling\n- **Convention**: \"feeling\" as default. Switch to \"felt experience\" only when 感受 functions as a *technical category label* (i.e., \"any part of P,\" the atomic unit of phenomena in the categorical framework), not when it describes what someone feels in ordinary first-person usage. Trigger criterion: ask \"Is 感受 here naming a *type of thing* (technical) or describing *what someone feels* (ordinary)?\" If the former, \"felt experience\" is available. If the latter, \"feeling.\"\n- **Related terms** (author's own terminological system):\n  - **体验 (tǐyàn)** → \"experience\" (processual, durational, immersive — the act of undergoing). Author explicitly equates with 感受 for referring to parts of P (范畴论与境, line 166), but in practice 体验 leans active/processual while 感受 leans passive/receptive.\n  - **经验 (jīngyàn)** → \"experience\" (accumulated/epistemic — Kantian *Erfahrung*); \"experiential\" (adj); \"empirical experience\" (disambiguation when 体验 is nearby); 经验性的 → \"empirical.\" NEVER synonymous with 感受.\n  - **感觉 (gǎnjué)** → \"sensation\" (raw input, Sense 1 per author's fn2; \"impression\" acceptable locally when referring to a gestalt rather than raw sensory data).\n  - AVOID: \"lived experience\" (too Husserlian — imports *Erlebnis*), \"phenomenal experience\" (redundant with 现象X compounds), \"qualia\" (too loaded with phil-mind debates author sidesteps).\n- **Note**: The author's foundational phenomenological term. The author explicitly distinguishes two senses (诗意 essay, footnote [^2]): (1) received stimuli/information (= 感觉/sensation), (2) the \"crystallization, surge, turbulence\" these give rise to. Both are 感受, but Sense 2 is the primary meaning. P (phenomena) = \"全部的感受之总和\" (the totality of all feelings). \"Meaning and feeling are two sides of one body\" (意义和感受即是两面一体). In the categorical framework (范畴论与境), both objects AND morphisms in E are 感受 — this is why E has tower structure. The self itself IS a 感受: \"'I' is that feeling\" (范畴论与境, line 210). Buddhism expert: parallels Buddhist *vedana* (受, feeling-tone) but broader. Wittgenstein expert: \"feeling\" has serious philosophical pedigree (James, Whitehead, Wittgenstein's own *Gefühl*). The author's register is deliberately non-technical — 感受 is an everyday Chinese word loaded with extraordinary philosophical weight.\n- **Translator's note (TN draft)**: \"感受 (*gǎnshòu*, 'feeling'): the author's term for the basic constituent of phenomena. It encompasses both received stimuli (sensory input) and the felt awareness — the 'crystallization, surge, and turbulence' — these give rise to (see author's footnote [^2] in the Poetics essay). In this work, all elements of phenomena are feelings, and phenomena is defined as 'the totality of all feelings.'\"\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: RESOLVED (10/10 unanimous — 6 for \"feeling\" as default, 4 for \"felt experience\" as default, all 10 confirmed the compromise: \"feeling\" default + \"felt experience\" for technical scope).\n\n---\n\n## 恒常 (hengchang)\n\n- **Main translation**: constancy\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"permanence\" (too strong -- implies timeless eternality; use only in explicit Kantian First Analogy contexts)\n  - \"invariance\" (mathematical/formal contexts)\n  - \"stability\" (when referring to stable structures)\n- **Note**: All nine experts converge on \"constancy\" as the best translation. The author identifies this as \"the core of metaphysics\" (形而上的核心是恒常). It is the non-rational demand we impose on phenomena: that patterns will hold, that the same causes produce the same effects, that identity persists across time. The author connects constancy to identity (同一) and causality (因果), noting \"causality is just temporal identity.\" Chinese Philosophy expert emphasizes this is epistemological/pragmatic, NOT ontological -- we *seek* invariant patterns, not asserting things really are permanent. Buddhism expert notes the critical contrast with Buddhist *anitya* (无常, impermanence): Buddhism sees pursuit of permanence as ignorance to overcome; the author sees pursuit of constancy as a non-rational feature to be *recognized and worked with lucidly*. Metaphysics expert: \"constancy\" avoids the excessive strength of \"permanence\" and the weakness of \"regularity.\" Wittgenstein expert: related to the \"hardness\" of certain propositions in *On Certainty* -- propositions that function as the stable framework within which other propositions can be doubted (OC §96). In technical passages connecting 恒常 to functorial preservation, \"invariance\" is more precise.\n\n---\n\n## 诗意 (shiyi)\n\n- **Main translation**: the poetic\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"poetic dwelling\" (Heidegger connection)\n  - \"poetic engagement\" / \"poetic stance\" (emphasizing activity/orientation)\n  - \"poeticality\" (Buddhism expert)\n  - \"*shiyi*\" (untranslated, like *Dasein*; Existentialism)\n- **Note**: This is the author's central positive contribution -- the post-metaphysical existential stance. All experts agree it does NOT mean \"poetry\" in the literary sense. It is defined as \"清醒的梦境\" (the lucid dreamscape): being fully invested in meaning while knowing that meaning is constructed. The author: \"After metaphysics, facing meaning should be poetic.\" Contrasted with 沉醉的梦境 (intoxicated dreamscape = pre-metaphysical belief/faith). Existentialism expert: differs from Nietzsche's voluntaristic *amor fati*, Camus's heroic revolt, and Heidegger's quietistic *Gelassenheit* -- it is active but not heroic, aware but not detached. Chinese Philosophy expert recommends capitalizing \"the Poetic\" to signal philosophical weight. Buddhism expert: this is genuinely novel, not found in Buddhist sources; it is the \"third way\" between intoxication and nihilistic void. Kantian expert: closer to Nietzsche's \"gay science\" than Kant's practical reason. Wittgenstein expert: no direct Wittgensteinian equivalent, but resonates with the *Investigations*' own style -- proceeding through examples, metaphors, and invitations to *look* rather than formal argument. The poetic is itself a philosophical method.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: RESOLVED (unanimous, 10/10). \"The poetic\" as standard substantive form; \"poetic\" as adjective; \"poeticality\" acceptable but use sparingly (prefer \"poetic stance\" or \"poetic mode\" as noun variants). Capitalize \"the Poetic\" in glossary, translator's introduction, and Essay 5 title; lowercase \"the poetic\" in running text. Capitalize on first occurrence per essay when introducing the concept, lowercase thereafter. Not to be confused with *poetics* (诗学, the study of poetry/literary theory).\n\n---\n\n## 梦境 (mengjing)\n\n- **Main translation**: dreamscape\n- **Morphological link**: dream + -scape (= dream + 境); the 境 component is visible through the established -scape echo (see 境-family system above)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"dream-realm\" (emphasizing spatial/bounded quality)\n  - \"experiential milieu\" / \"meaning-field\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"experiential environment\" / \"meaning-world\" (Existentialism)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on \"dreamscape\" as the best main translation. The author explicitly states this is NOT just literal dreaming: \"任何感受都有使得他得以展现的'环境'\" (any feeling has an 'environment' that enables it to manifest). Examples: games, novels, rituals, relationships, daily life. The \"dream\" metaphor captures: (1) constructed/artificial character, (2) immersive quality, (3) capacity to evoke powerful experience despite being constructed. Chinese Philosophy expert recommends \"dream-realm\" as alternative to preserve both 梦 and 境 components. Buddhism expert notes the Diamond Sutra parallel: \"All conditioned phenomena are like a dream\" -- but the author's dreamscape is NOT illusion to be escaped; it is structure to be engaged with lucidly. The dreamscape is where meaning and feeling become \"two sides of one body.\" Wittgenstein expert: the immersed/lucid distinction resonates with the difference between being *within* a language game (as participants normally are) and being *aware* of the language game as a language game -- but the author's concept is richer: lucidity does not diminish engagement, whereas Wittgensteinian awareness typically implies philosophical detachment.\n\n---\n\n## 境界 (jingjie)\n\n- **Main translation**: bounds / horizon\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"realm\" (when used to mean a delimited domain)\n  - \"domain\" (Phenomenology)\n- **Relation to 境**: 境界 is a fixed compound where 境 and 界 are near-synonyms reinforcing each other (both mean boundary/limit/domain). It is NOT compositionally \"the 界 of 境.\" The -scape link does NOT apply — different compositional logic from 梦境 (where 境 is the formal core). See 境-family system in the 境 entry.\n- **Occurrences**: Only in Essay 6 (范畴论与境 整理), lines 17-25. The author self-glosses 境界 as 界限 (limits/boundary) on first use (line 17).\n- **Key moment (line 25)**: The author writes 境界 and bare 境 side by side — \"超越了静态的思想的*境界*（明日之**境**不同于今日之**境**）\" — distinguishing the static boundary (境界) from the evolving field (境). Multiple experts identified this as the \"moment of conceptual birth\" where 境 is liberated from 境界.\n- **Translator's note**: One footnote at line 25 only (NO note at line 17). The note should explain: (1) 境界 shares the character 境 with Jing, (2) the author here separates what was a fused compound — the boundary drops away and the structured field stands alone, (3) this is the transitional moment from traditional to technical usage. Rationale for no note at line 17: at that point, Jing has not yet been introduced as a technical concept; a forward-reference would be noise. Let the reader encounter 境界 as ordinary \"bounds\" first, then witness the separation at line 25. (Decision: 5-5 expert split, author chose \"no\" side; chinese-phil-expert's linguistic argument was decisive — 境界 is a reinforcing compound, not \"boundary of Jing.\")\n- **Note**: Distinguished from 境 (Jing). The author uses 境界 in its traditional sense: the bounds or horizon of a domain (language, thought). Phenomenology expert: parallel to Husserl's \"horizon\" (*Horizont*). Buddhism expert: carries both spatial sense (extent of domain) and soteriological sense (level of attainment). Do NOT confuse with the technical term 境 (Jing).\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: RESOLVED. Previous split between \"boundary/horizon\" and \"realm\" — now resolved to \"bounds/horizon\" as default, following the author's own 界限 gloss. \"Realm\" acceptable only when emphasizing the domain rather than its limits.\n\n---\n\n## 非理性 (feilixing)\n\n- **Main translation**: the non-rational\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"non-rationality\" (nominal form)\n  - \"arational\" (to avoid negative connotation of \"irrational\")\n  - \"extra-rational\" (emphasizing beyond-reason)\n  - \"beyond reason\" (discursive)\n  - AVOID: \"irrational\" (has pejorative connotations; means \"contrary to reason\")\n- **Note**: All nine experts agree this must NOT be translated as \"irrational.\" The author's argument: \"the purpose of reason must lie outside reason\" -- reason is a tool; its goals are non-rational. The pursuit of ultimate reality, the demand for constancy, the need for self-realization -- all are non-rational. This is NOT defective reasoning but a domain outside reason's reach. The author insists: \"this non-rationality should be acknowledged\" (承认). Epistemology expert: resolves the regress problem differently than foundationalism or coherentism -- the regress ends in non-rational commitment, which is accepted rather than disguised. Buddhism expert: parallels Buddhist *tanha* (craving), but Buddhism aims to overcome it while the author aims to recognize it and work with it lucidly. Kantian expert: departure from Kant, for whom reason's demand for the unconditioned is rational. Wittgenstein expert: corresponds to what cannot be *said* but only *shown* (Tractatus 4.1212, 6.522); the later Wittgenstein's insistence that reasons come to an end (PI §211, §217: \"This is simply what I do\") is also relevant -- justification bottoms out in non-rational action.\n\n---\n\n## 形而上 (xing er shang)\n\n- **Main translation**: the metaphysical (mass noun / domain)\n- **Count noun form**: \"a metaphysical\" or \"a metaphysical construct\" (for specific instances)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"meta-formation\" (Phenomenology)\n  - \"supra-phenomenal\" (Kantian)\n  - \"above-form\" (literal, archaic, use sparingly)\n  - AVOID: \"metaphysical object\" — imports substance-ontology the author dismantles; collides with category-theoretic \"object\" (对象 in Obj_E)\n- **Two grammatical modes** (unanimous, 10/10):\n  - General / mass noun: **\"the metaphysical\"** — \"constancy is the core of the metaphysical\"\n  - Count noun: **\"a metaphysical\"** or **\"a metaphysical construct\"** — \"a metaphysical m is an association in E\"\n  - Follows convention: \"a universal,\" \"a particular,\" \"a conditional\"\n- **Note**: All experts agree on the critical distinction: 形而上 (the metaphysical, as content/construct) vs. 形而上学 (metaphysics, as discipline). The author reinterprets 形 as 现象 (phenomena), making 形而上 literally \"that which is above/upon phenomena.\" In classical Chinese, 形而上 is a verbal-directional phrase (form + and-then + above) — it describes a direction/relation, not a thing. These are constructions we build upon phenomena that claim constancy/universality -- all Second Reality. The author's formal definition: \"a metaphysical m is an association in E, and m is a universal property in some subcategory of E.\" Note: the author's own English gloss at Essay 6 line 248 uses \"Metaphysics object of the third kind,\" but all experts recommend overriding this because \"object\" imports ontological weight the framework rejects. Chinese Philosophy expert emphasizes the author's claim that Chinese philosophy is mostly 有形而上而无形而上学 (has metaphysical frameworks but lacks systematic metaphysical inquiry). Wittgenstein expert: this is not \"structure\" in the Wittgensteinian sense of \"logical form\" (Tractatus); the author's 形而上 are *experiential* constructions. Use \"the metaphysical\" (substantive) consistently; never collapse with \"metaphysics\" (the discipline).\n\n---\n\n## 形而上学 (xing er shang xue)\n\n- **Main translation**: metaphysics (the discipline)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"metaphysical inquiry\" (emphasizing investigative aspect)\n  - \"the study of the metaphysical\" (when clarifying distinction from 形而上)\n- **Note**: All experts agree. Derived from the *Yijing* phrase \"形而上者谓之道.\" The author carefully distinguishes this from 形而上. Western metaphysics seeks ultimate reality; Chinese thought more often operates within given metaphysical frameworks. The term was coined by Japanese scholar Inoue Tetsujiro to translate \"metaphysics.\" Standard translation.\n\n---\n\n## 第一实在 (di yi shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: First Reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"primary reality\" (acceptable variant, but \"First\" preserves numbering)\n  - \"phenomenal reality\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"the originary given\" (Phenomenology, scholarly contexts)\n- **Translator's note**: Footnote at first occurrence glossing \"First Reality\" as \"Primary Reality\" — i.e., primary in the order of epistemic access, not an ontological claim about what is \"most real.\" See the author's own caveat in footnote 25.\n- **Note**: All experts agree on preserving the numbering system. This designates phenomena (现象) as what we encounter first, epistemically and practically. CRITICAL: The author explicitly states (footnote 25) that this is a *name* (名称), not an ontological claim that phenomena are the \"most real\" stuff of reality. It designates epistemic-practical priority: phenomena are indubitable, cannot be bypassed, and are the necessary starting point. \"First\" means first in the order of access, not first in the order of being. Kantian expert: parallels Kant's \"empirical reality\" but precedes all transcendental constitution. Phenomenology expert: parallels Husserl's principle of principles. Wittgenstein expert: corresponds to \"What has to be accepted, the given, is -- so one could say -- forms of life\" (PI p. 226). Capitalize \"First Reality\" when used as technical term.\n\n---\n\n## 第二实在 (di er shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: Second Reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"constructed reality\" (explanatory gloss)\n  - \"constituted reality\" (Phenomenology)\n  - \"interpreted reality\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n- **Note**: All experts agree. Consists of constructions we build upon phenomena -- the \"things\" we posit as persisting objects, the concepts we abstract, the frameworks we assemble. The objective world (客观世界) is explicitly called a \"model\" (模型) based on phenomena. The numbering indicates it is reached second, after phenomena. All metaphysical constructs live here. Whenever we articulate Zeroth Reality, the articulation itself becomes Second Reality. Wittgenstein expert: when we articulate Zeroth Reality, the articulation itself becomes Second Reality -- parallels Wittgenstein's idea that once we try to *say* what can only be *shown*, we produce constructions within the domain of the sayable. Capitalize \"Second Reality\" as technical term.\n\n---\n\n## 第〇实在 (di ling shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: Zeroth Reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Ultimate Reality\" (as explanatory gloss, but loses structural numbering)\n  - \"Reality-Zero\" (more colloquial)\n  - \"ground reality\" (Buddhism)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on preserving the \"zeroth\" numbering. This is what traditional metaphysics calls 终极实在 (ultimate reality) -- the Dao, the Unmoved Mover, God, the thing-in-itself. The \"zeroth\" numbering is philosophically loaded: it designates a structural placeholder we can never reach from within the system. Whenever articulated, it becomes Second Reality. Metaphysics expert: parallels Kant's unknowable thing-in-itself and Wittgenstein's \"what can be shown but not said.\" Buddhism expert: compares to Yogacara's *parinispanna* (consummate nature) but diverges because the author insists on in-principle inaccessibility. Kantian expert: mirrors Kant's *Grenzbegriff* (limiting concept). Wittgenstein expert: parallels the Tractatus's \"Not *how* the world is, is the mystical, but *that* it is\" (6.44) -- what cannot be said but only shown. AVOID: \"non-reality\" or \"zero reality\" (suggests non-existence rather than inaccessibility). Capitalize \"Zeroth Reality.\"\n\n---\n\n## 实在 (shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the real\" (substantive)\n  - \"actuality\" (when emphasizing concrete existence)\n- **Note**: When used without numerical prefix, 实在 means \"reality\" in the ordinary sense, but the author's framework implies we must always ask: which reality? The three-fold schema (第〇/第一/第二实在) stratifies what counts as \"real\" according to epistemic access and constructive order. Buddhism expert: use \"Reality\" with capital R when part of the numbered system. AVOID: \"substance\" (Aristotelian baggage) or \"being\" (conflates with 存在).\n\n---\n\n## 清醒的梦境 (qingxing de mengjing)\n\n- **Main translation**: the lucid dreamscape\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the self-aware dreamscape\"\n  - \"the reflective dreamscape\"\n- **Note**: The author's term for post-metaphysical, poetic existence: being in a dreamscape while knowing you're in one, yet still fully investing. \"清醒\" (lucid/awake/clear-headed) indicates self-awareness. The author explicitly invokes \"lucid dreaming\" as the metaphor. This is the stance enabled by recognizing the disenchantment of Zeroth Reality. Buddhism expert: parallels Chan awakening's third stage -- \"after enlightenment, mountains are mountains again.\" All experts agree \"lucid dreamscape\" perfectly captures the concept.\n\n---\n\n## 沉醉的梦境 (chenzui de mengjing)\n\n- **Main translation**: the intoxicated dreamscape\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the entranced dreamscape\" (if \"intoxicated\" feels too strong)\n- **Note**: Pre-metaphysical existence: being in a dreamscape without knowing you're in one. The author identifies this with belief/faith (信念/信仰) where purpose appears as logically groundless. After disenchantment (祛魅), one \"can no longer\" (无法再) be intoxicated — the loss of innocence is irreversible. Existentialism expert: corresponds to Sartre's *mauvaise foi* but the author is more generous — intoxication is not moral failing but the natural pre-nihilistic stance. The contrast \"intoxicated dreamscape\" vs. \"lucid dreamscape\" is the central pair of the 诗意 essay.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: RESOLVED (unanimous, 10/10 after debate). \"Intoxicated\" confirmed. See 沉醉 entry for full rationale.\n\n---\n\n## 清醒 (qingxing)\n\n- **Main translation**: lucid\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"awake\" (acceptable, especially in \"awake within the dream\")\n  - \"wakeful\" (Buddhism)\n  - \"clear-minded\" / \"clear-sighted\"\n- **Note**: All experts converge on \"lucid\" as the best translation. Describes the mode of inhabiting a dreamscape while aware it is constructed. Buddhism expert: carries overtones of Buddhist *bodhi* (awakening) but is epistemological rather than soteriological. Phenomenology expert: parallels Husserl's phenomenological attitude. Wittgenstein expert: corresponds to the philosophical moment of recognizing a language game *as* a language game, but without the Wittgensteinian consequence of therapeutic dissolution -- the author insists lucidity does not diminish engagement. AVOID: \"awakened\" (too specifically Buddhist); \"conscious\" (too Cartesian/neutral).\n\n---\n\n## 沉醉 (chenzui)\n\n- **Main translation**: intoxicated\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"entranced\" (acceptable compromise if \"intoxicated\" feels too strong)\n  - AVOID as main translation: \"absorbed\" and \"immersed\" — the author uses 投入 (engagement) and 沉浸 (immersion) to describe the LUCID dreamscape (line 25), so absorption/immersion is shared by both states. Only \"intoxicated\" marks the distinction.\n- **Translator's note**: TN on first occurrence: \"沉醉 (chenzui, literally 'sunk-drunk'): epistemic condition of unknowing engagement — not a moral judgment, but the state of taking constructed meaning for given reality.\"\n- **Note**: Engagement in a dreamscape without meta-awareness of its constructed nature. Literally \"sink-drunk\" (沉=sink, 醉=drunk). The author chose 沉醉 over neutral alternatives (沉浸, 投入, 专注) deliberately. The pejorative connotation is a feature, not a bug: it captures an epistemic deficit (not knowing you are in a dreamscape), not a moral failing. Buddhism expert: parallels Buddhist *mada* (intoxication/heedlessness, an upaklesha). Existentialism expert: maps onto Heidegger's *das Man* but is specifically a state one moves beyond (unlike Verfallen, which is structural). The key argument: \"intoxicated\" is the natural antonym of \"lucid\" along the axis of self-awareness. You can be lucid AND immersed (the poetic), but you cannot be lucid AND intoxicated (contradiction). This asymmetry is the engine of the 诗意 essay.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: RESOLVED (unanimous, 10/10 after debate — phil-mind and wittgenstein switched from \"immersed,\" phenomenology withdrew \"absorbed\"). \"Intoxicated\" as default. \"Absorbed\" and \"immersed\" reserved for contexts where the author uses 投入 or 沉浸 (shared by both dreamscape modes).\n\n---\n\n## 联想 (lianxiang)\n\n- **Main translation**: association\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"associative connection\" (when emphasizing relational character)\n  - \"cognitive morphism\" (Philosophy of Mind, technical)\n  - \"associative morphism\" (Phenomenology, technical)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on \"association\" as the main translation. In the categorical framework, associations are the morphisms (arrows) connecting experiences within E. Crucially, associations are themselves experiences (感受), which is why E has tower structure. Phenomenology expert: carries the weight of Husserl's passive synthesis through association (*Assoziation*). Philosophy of Mind expert: adds composability -- if A associates to B and B to C, there is a determinate A-to-C association. Metaphysics expert: echoes Hume's \"association of ideas\" but is more structural. Chinese Philosophy expert warns that 联想 also means \"imagination\" in Chinese -- not the intended sense. Wittgenstein expert: no direct Wittgensteinian parallel, but the idea that the link *between* experiences is itself an experience has affinities with William James's stream of consciousness and Husserl's internal time-consciousness.\n\n---\n\n## 超越 (chaoyue)\n\n- **Main translation**: transcendence (noun) / to transcend (verb)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"going-beyond\" (verbal, less technical)\n  - \"surpass\" (when emphasizing exceeding limits)\n- **Note**: The author uses this in multiple senses: (1) the traditional metaphysical quest for Zeroth Reality (a failed attempt at transcendence); (2) what lies outside the current boundary of thought; (3) immanent self-transformation through practice. True transcendence (reaching Zeroth Reality) is impossible, but dynamic transcendence (evolution of one's experiential sphere) is real. Kantian expert: author's usage is closer to Heidegger's *Uberstieg* than to Kant's transcendental method. AVOID: \"transcendental\" (Kantian term of art) unless specifically discussing Kant.\n\n---\n\n## 超越性 (chaoyuexing)\n\n- **Main translation**: transcendence (as quality/property) / transcendent character\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the transcendent\" (substantive)\n  - \"outward-reaching dimension\" (Existentialism)\n- **Note**: The nominal form, referring to the quality of transcending. Key usage: \"one's own death is transcendent for oneself\" -- death is beyond the boundary of one's experiential sphere. Existentialism expert: sharp critique of Heidegger's *Sein-zum-Tode* -- the death one \"lives toward\" is always one's metaphysical conception of death, not death itself.\n\n---\n\n## 虚无 (xuwu)\n\n- **Main translation**: nothingness / the void (context-dependent)\n- **Convention**: Both \"nothingness\" and \"the void\" are acceptable; translator chooses based on passage. Use \"nothingness\" when 虚无 describes the philosophical *condition* — the absence left after the collapse of metaphysical value (abstract, propositional, Sartrean *néant*). Use \"the void\" when 虚无 carries spatial/environmental/experiential connotation — the desolate landscape one confronts or inhabits. Note: standalone 虚无 is rare in the essays; it appears almost exclusively in the compound 虚无主义 (= always \"nihilism\").\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"nihility\" (formal philosophical contexts)\n  - AVOID: \"emptiness\" — NEVER use for 虚无 (reserved for Buddhist 空/sunyata). Non-negotiable.\n- **Note**: All experts agree on the critical distinction from Buddhist 空 (emptiness/sunyata). The author's 虚无 is the void left when the highest values (ultimate reality) collapse -- not a positive entity but an absence. \"Nihilism is not a something, a doctrine, but a nothing, a void\" (后形而上学 整理, line 100: \"一种无，一种缺位\"). Chinese Philosophy expert: 虚 (empty, void) + 无 (nothing) -- simultaneously negative and cosmologically resonant (the Daoist productive void). Buddhism expert: this IS the nihilistic extreme (*ucchedavada*) that Madhyamaka warns against, but the author does not remain here.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: RESOLVED (10/10 unanimous). Context-dependent: \"nothingness\" or \"the void\" based on passage. NEVER \"emptiness.\"\n\n---\n\n## 虚无主义 (xuwu zhuyi)\n\n- **Main translation**: nihilism\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the condition of nihility\" (when emphasizing state rather than doctrine)\n- **Note**: Standard translation. The author understands nihilism not as a doctrine but as a condition of meaning-loss: \"Nihilism is not produced or created, just as void is not produced or created, but rather because nothing was produced or created -- nothing is here.\" Existentialism expert: arrives through structural rather than historical analysis (contrast Nietzsche). The author's entire project is framed as what comes after nihilism.\n\n---\n\n## 后形而上学 (hou xing er shang xue)\n\n- **Main translation**: post-metaphysics\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"post-metaphysical thinking\" (echoing Habermas)\n- **Note**: All experts agree. Not \"after and done with\" metaphysics but \"after and transformed.\" The author defines it as metaphysics that: (1) takes phenomena as center, (2) acknowledges all 形而上 as constructions upon phenomena, (3) acknowledges non-rationality, (4) centers on practice (实践) as the overlap of ideal and phenomenon. Kantian expert: parallels Kant's limitation of metaphysics but goes further -- accepts non-rationality at the foundation. AVOID: \"postmetaphysics\" (one word) which might suggest a total break rather than transformation.\n\n---\n\n## 前形而上学 (qian xing er shang xue)\n\n- **Main translation**: traditional metaphysics\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"classical metaphysics\" (author's alternate gloss)\n  - \"pre-nihilist metaphysics\" (precise, for scholarly contexts)\n  - AVOID: \"pre-metaphysics\" (sounds like \"before metaphysics existed\")\n- **Translator's note**: Footnote at first occurrence: \"Traditional metaphysics (前形而上学, literally 'prior-metaphysics'): the author's coinage for metaphysics as practiced before the nihilistic crisis — i.e., pre-nihilist metaphysics. The entire tradition from its origins through to the collapse of its highest values. The author's periodization: traditional metaphysics (前形而上学) → nihilism (虚无主义) → post-metaphysics (后形而上学). The 前 ('before') is relative to nihilism, not to the existence of metaphysics as a discipline.\"\n- **Note**: The author's term for the entire Western and Chinese metaphysical traditions before nihilism -- from Thales through Hegel, from the *Yijing* through Neo-Confucianism. The defining feature is pursuit of ultimate reality without awareness that this pursuit is non-rational. The author explicitly glosses this as 传统形而上学 (\"traditional metaphysics\") and 经典形而上学 (\"classical metaphysics\"). Unanimous expert consensus (10/10) on \"traditional metaphysics\" as main translation with \"pre-nihilist\" in TN.\n\n---\n\n## 存在 (cunzai)\n\n- **Main translation**: existence / being / to exist\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Being\" (capitalized, when discussing ontology or translating Heidegger's *Sein*)\n  - \"existence\" (when asking whether something exists)\n  - \"presence\" (Phenomenology, when emphasizing being-present)\n- **Note**: Context-dependent. The author's framework is cautious about ontology. Existence is tied to presence in phenomena: something exists (for us) insofar as it appears in First Reality or is well-grounded in Second Reality. Existentialism expert: the author shifts from the question of Being to the structure of experiential fields. Phenomenology expert: when the author says phenomena \"存在,\" this is better translated as \"are present/given\" than \"exist\" in a metaphysical sense. Do NOT assume this maps cleanly onto Heidegger's *Sein/Seiende* distinction.\n\n---\n\n## 道 (dao)\n\n- **Main translation**: the Way\n- **Convention**: In Laozi block quotes and running text alike, use \"the Way\" (lowercase \"the\" mid-sentence). First occurrence: \"the Way (道, *dao*)\".\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Dao\" (transliterated, for comparative/scholarly contexts)\n- **Note**: All experts agree (10/10 unanimous). \"The Way\" carries the semantic weight needed for the author's \"philosophical experiment\" — the reader must FEEL the conventional metaphysical meaning before the author deconstructs it. Romanized \"Dao\" would prevent this. The author uses 道 primarily in the 道德仁义礼 sequence analysis, showing it is GENERATED last through progressive generalization from phenomena, not given first as the primordial source. Chinese Philosophy expert: \"genuinely original -- no classical Chinese philosopher has argued that 道 itself is a cognitive construction built from phenomenal observation upward.\" Buddhism expert: parallels *dharma-kaya* or *tathata* but the author emphasizes inaccessibility through articulation. In the category-theoretic framework, 道 appears at different meta-orders depending on whether the construction is top-down or bottom-up. AVOID over-committing to any particular Daoist interpretation.\n\n---\n\n## 德 (de)\n\n- **Main translation**: (constitutive) character\n- **Convention**: \"(constitutive) character\" with parentheses on first occurrence per essay; \"character\" thereafter in running text. In Laozi block quotes, use \"virtue\" (the conventional rendering) — the shift from \"virtue\" to \"character\" enacts the author's reconceptualization. First occurrence in analysis: \"character\" (德, *de*).\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"virtue\" — ONLY in classical block quotes (Laozi, etc.), never in the author's own analysis\n  - AVOID: \"De\" (transliterated) in running text — romanized terms prevent the \"philosophical experiment\" from working on Western readers (\"you can't deconstruct what was never constructed\")\n  - AVOID: \"essence\" (Western metaphysical baggage)\n  - \"power\" / \"potency\" / \"efficacy\" (Daoist cosmological contexts only, with TN)\n- **Note**: The author analyzes 德 as \"what makes a thing what it is\" (使得人而成为人的东西) — the collection of properties we inductively generalize and then normatively impose as definitional. Crucially, 德 applies to ALL things (凡事诸物皆有其德), not just moral agents — every entity has its \"character,\" the regularity that makes it what it is. This constructivist reading departs from both the standard Confucian sense (moral virtue) and the Daoist sense (natural potency). \"Character\" was chosen (7-3, then unanimous after debate) as lightweight, naturally universal (rocks and dogs have \"character\"), and preserving the constructivist ambiguity. Buddhism expert: parallels Buddhist *svabhava* (self-nature) but is relational/functional, not essential.\n- **Translator's note (TN draft)**: \"The author reconceives 德 (de) not as virtue in the moral sense but as (constitutive) character — the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle.\"\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: RESOLVED (9/9 unanimous final confirmation + translator). \"(Constitutive) character\" as main rendering; \"virtue\" only in classical block quotes; shift between the two enacts the author's argument.\n\n---\n\n## 本质 (benzhi)\n\n- **Main translation**: essence / essential nature\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"nature\" (less technical)\n  - \"whatness\" (technical, echoing scholastic *quidditas*)\n- **Note**: In the author's post-metaphysical framework, \"essence\" is reinterpreted: not a hidden inner nature but the universal property of a stable subcategory in E. The author replaces intrinsic essence with structural position: \"what is Theseus's ship? It is that experience which you associate with any part of the ship.\" Metaphysics expert: danger of readers importing Aristotelian *ousia*. Standard translation works if the translator tracks the relocation from substance to structure.\n\n---\n\n## 构造 (gouzao)\n\n- **Main translation**: construction / to construct\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"constitution\" (Phenomenology, for Husserl's *Konstitution*)\n  - \"structuration\" (when emphasizing process)\n  - \"synthesis\" (Kantian, when parallel is explicit)\n- **Note**: The author distinguishes description from construction. E (境) is descriptive of P (phenomena), not constructive. However, within the category-theoretic framework, \"构造\" is a specific technical notion: a tower-structure built from base objects (基石). All experts agree on \"construction\" as default; Phenomenology expert recommends \"constitution\" for phenomenological contexts where Husserl's *Konstitution* is paralleled. Kantian expert: parallels Kant's synthesis but is more dynamic and revisable.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: RESOLVED (author's decision). \"Construction\" as default; \"constitution\" only in explicitly Husserlian comparative passages. The author's usage is broader than either Husserl's or Kant's.\n\n---\n\n## 实践 (shijian)\n\n- **Main translation**: practice / praxis\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"practical engagement\"\n  - \"praxis\" (Marxist/Aristotelian contexts)\n- **Note**: Core of the author's post-metaphysics. Defined as \"the overlap of ideal and phenomenon\" (理想和现象之重叠). Practice is where metaphysical constructs (Second Reality) and phenomena (First Reality) come together -- where we act in the world guided by concepts. Kantian expert: not Kant's \"practical reason\" (moral/volitional) but closer to pragmatist or Marxist praxis. The author: \"we are creators, poets of our own lives and feelings\" through practice.\n\n---\n\n## 我 (wo)\n\n- **Main translation**: I / self\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the self\" (when discussing the concept philosophically)\n  - \"the I\" (when analyzing 我 as philosophical object)\n  - AVOID: \"ego\" (unless explicitly discussing Husserl's transcendental ego or Freud)\n- **Note**: The author provides a category-theoretic definition: \"'I' is that feeling, the feeling that whenever you mention any aspect related to me, it causes me to associate.\" Formally, \"I\" is the universal property (terminal object) of a subcategory of E containing all experiences related to me. This provides a structural, non-substantialist account of self. Philosophy of Mind expert: aligns with Buddhist Abhidharma analysis (self as conventional designation), Hume's bundle theory, and narrative self theories. Buddhism expert: \"remarkable convergence\" -- the definition IS the Middle Way on self (not eternalism, not nihilism). Chinese Philosophy expert: resonates with Buddhist 无我 (no-self) but approached phenomenologically. Wittgenstein expert: compatible with Wittgenstein's anti-Cartesianism -- \"I\" is not a substance but a structural position (cf. Tractatus 5.631--5.641: \"The subject does not belong to the world: rather, it is a limit of the world\").\n\n---\n\n## 自我 (ziwo)\n\n- **Main translation**: self (reflexive/philosophical)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"ego\" (only in explicit psychoanalytic contexts)\n  - \"oneself\" (reflexive usage)\n- **Note**: Distinguished from 我 by being reflexive/objectified. While 我 is the first-person subject, 自我 is the self as object of reflection or concern. Philosophy of Mind expert: 自我 emerges at T_1 or higher in the tower structure -- it is the experience of oneself as object of reflection. The author discusses self-transformation: \"based on the present self, through practice, transcend the present self and construct a new self.\"\n\n---\n\n## 自我实现 (ziwo shixian)\n\n- **Main translation**: self-realization\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"self-actualization\" (AVOID -- too Maslow-specific)\n- **Note**: The author glosses: \"making the self become actual/real\" (使得自我得以成为现实). Tied to practice and the overlap of ideal and phenomenon: \"we see ourselves in phenomena, confirm my existence, make phenomena become 'part of me.'\" Echoes Hegel's *Selbstverwirklichung* and Marxist self-realization through labor. \"Self-realization\" captures the making-real better than \"self-actualization.\"\n\n---\n\n## 意义 (yiyi)\n\n- **Main translation**: meaning / significance\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"significance\" (when emphasizing weight)\n  - \"sense\" (when emphasizing intelligibility)\n  - \"purpose\" (when teleological dimension is primary)\n- **Note**: Central to the author's argument: meaning and feeling are \"two sides of one body\" (两面一体). Meaning IS felt experience. The author: \"I boldly surmise that meaning and purpose are in fact the surging of sensibility, the crystallization of experience.\" The attempt to seek meaning externally (向外寻求意义) is the category error that generates absurdity. Existentialism expert: connects to Heidegger's *Befindlichkeit* but is more radical -- meaning cannot be separated from affect. Wittgenstein expert: closer to Wittgenstein's meaning-as-use than to Frege's *Sinn*/*Bedeutung* or truth-conditional accounts. In some contexts (especially 后形而上学), 意义 operates more as \"purpose\" or \"significance-for-a-life\"; context should guide the choice between \"meaning\" and \"significance.\"\n\n---\n\n## 理解 (lijie)\n\n- **Main translation**: understanding / to understand\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"comprehension\"\n- **Note**: The author formalizes understanding as a natural transformation between two functorial evolutions: the evolution of a structure and the evolution of one's experience. You understand something when these align coherently. Philosophy of Mind expert: \"revolutionary account\" -- understanding is not correspondence between mind and world but alignment between internal simulation and external structure. Epistemology expert: dissolves the understanding/explanation distinction. Broader than 掌握 (mastery) -- there is a gradient. Wittgenstein expert: parallels Wittgenstein's *Verstehen* -- \"But how does the understanding manifest itself?\" Wittgenstein answers in terms of ability (PI §154: the ability to go on); the author's natural transformation η can be read as a formalization of this ability. \"Understanding\" is the right translation; \"comprehension\" is too cognitive.\n\n---\n\n## 掌握 (zhangwo)\n\n- **Main translation**: mastery / to grasp\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"command\" (emphasizing full competence)\n  - \"complete understanding\"\n- **Note**: Technical term in the natural transformation analysis. To \"grasp\" a formula means the natural transformation component is the identity morphism -- no gap between your derivation and the truth. Epistemology expert: \"a phenomenological notion of knowledge.\" Philosophy of Mind expert: explains why some correct computations don't feel like mastery and why mastery persists across contexts. Wittgenstein expert: Wittgenstein's \"knowing how to go on\" (PI §151) is closer to 理解 than to 掌握; the latter's directness and immediacy has more affinity with Husserl's *Evidenz*. Recommends \"mastery\" for general use, \"direct grasp\" for philosophically precise contexts.\n\n---\n\n## 知识 (zhishi)\n\n- **Main translation**: knowledge\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"belief taken to be correct\" (when emphasizing author's deflationary analysis)\n- **Note**: Epistemology expert: the author radically redefines knowledge by collapsing the JTB (Justified True Belief) tripartite analysis. Through the \"access argument,\" truth and justification both reduce to belief in practice. More radical than post-Gettier externalism -- dissolves the knowledge/belief distinction entirely at the practical level. Wittgenstein expert: aligns with certain readings of *On Certainty* (Moyal-Sharrock's \"animal certainty\") but goes further -- Wittgenstein preserves the grammar of \"knowing\" even while transforming its philosophical significance. The author's thesis is deflationary.\n\n---\n\n## 信念 (xinnian)\n\n- **Main translation**: belief\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"doxastic state\" (technical epistemological contexts)\n  - \"conviction\" (when emphasizing strength)\n- **Note**: Central to the author's dissolution of JTB. Defined as \"a thought of taking something as true,\" inherently subjective. The author argues all justification reduces to belief (belief-about-belief). Epistemology expert: the Chinese 信念 carries stronger connotations of conviction than English \"belief.\" Wittgenstein expert: Wittgenstein's *On Certainty* distinguishes between beliefs (which can be doubted) and hinge propositions (which cannot be meaningfully doubted); the author's usage is closer to the ordinary sense.\n\n---\n\n## 真理 (zhenli)\n\n- **Main translation**: truth\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"objective truth\" (when distinguishing from subjective belief)\n- **Note**: The author's treatment is deflationary and access-focused. \"Truth\" in JTB refers to objective truth, but the author argues this is \"methodologically impossible\" to access. Not anti-realism (no ontological claim) but truth is \"inoperative\" in knowledge formation.\n\n---\n\n## 辩护 / 证成 (biànhù / zhèngchéng)\n\n- **Main translation**: justification\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"warrant\" (emphasizing epistemic entitlement)\n  - \"verification relation\" (in categorical framework)\n- **Note**: Epistemology expert: the author's central thesis is that justification reduces to belief. All justification bases collapse into belief when we ask how we access them. In the K1 framework, verification relations are morphisms in the knowledge category.\n\n---\n\n## 理性 (lixing)\n\n- **Main translation**: reason / rationality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the rational\" (as substantive, contrasted with non-rational)\n  - \"rational faculty\" (when emphasizing Kant's *Vernunft*)\n- **Note**: The author argues reason is a *tool* (工具) whose purposes are non-rational. Kantian expert: this deflates reason from its Kantian status as source of necessary structures and regulative ideals. Epistemology expert: rational justification cannot justify itself without circularity, so rationality's value is non-rationally grounded.\n\n---\n\n## 先验 (xianyan)\n\n- **Main translation**: a priori / transcendental (context-dependent)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"a priori\" (knowledge independent of experience)\n  - \"transcendental\" (conditions of possibility of experience)\n- **Note**: The author's treatment is carefully agnostic. Stable structures S_E preserved under evolution *might* include a priori elements if identified at the earliest cognitive stage. But this is *descriptive*, not transcendental deduction. Kantian expert: \"the form of synthetic a priori knowledge, but the content left to empirical investigation.\" Epistemology expert: naturalizes the a priori.\n\n---\n\n## 综合 (zonghe)\n\n- **Main translation**: synthesis / synthetic\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"integration\" (emphasizing unification)\n- **Note**: Used in contexts about how elements are combined to form higher-level structures. Kantian expert: the author extends Kant's synthetic a priori from mathematics to the domain of meaning. The framework suggests all knowledge is synthetic (constructed from experiential materials).\n\n---\n\n## 体验 (tiyan)\n\n- **Main translation**: experience (processual/immersive)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"lived experience\" (Husserlian contexts only — use sparingly; see AVOID note under 感受)\n  - \"Erlebnis\" (scholarly, Husserlian)\n  - \"experiential content\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n- **Note**: The author explicitly equates 体验 with 感受 for referring to parts of P (范畴论与境, line 166), but in practice 体验 leans active/processual/durational while 感受 leans passive/receptive. Closest to Husserl's *Erlebnis*. Kantian expert: closer to Husserl's *Erlebnis* or Dilthey's *Erleben*. Chinese Philosophy expert: emphasizes the \"living-through\" quality. Per the 感受 resolution: AVOID \"lived experience\" as default — too Husserlian, imports *Erlebnis* connotations the author does not invoke. Note: shares \"experience\" with 经验; see disambiguation rule under 经验 entry.\n\n---\n\n## 经验 (jingyan)\n\n- **Main translation**: experience (accumulated/epistemic)\n- **Convention**: Use plain \"experience\" as default. When 经验 appears as adjective/modifier, use \"experiential\" (经验结构 = experiential structure, 经验形态 = experiential forms). Adjectival 经验性的 → \"empirical.\" When 经验 and 体验 co-occur in proximity, 经验 takes \"experiential\" (adjectival) or \"empirical experience\" (nominal) to disambiguate from 体验 (\"experience\").\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"experiential\" (adjectival form — 经验结构, 经验形态)\n  - \"empirical experience\" (disambiguation variant when 体验 is nearby)\n  - \"empirical\" (for 经验性的)\n  - \"Erfahrung\" (scholarly, contrasting with *Erlebnis*)\n- **Note**: NEVER synonymous with 感受. Refers to accumulated, reflected-upon, epistemological experience — closer to Husserl's *Erfahrung* as opposed to *Erlebnis* (体验). Used in section headers \"经验的总结/预测/抽象\" (summary/prediction/abstraction of experience) and as adjective \"经验性的\" (empirical). In practice, 经验 and 体验 rarely appear in the same sentence; context disambiguates. Kantian expert: Kant's *Erfahrung* — structured, unified cognition of phenomena. Philosophy of Mind expert: marks the boundary between a priori and empirical. Expert vote: 10/10 unanimous confirmation of \"experience\" as main with proximity disambiguation rule.\n\n---\n\n## 意识 (yishi)\n\n- **Main translation**: consciousness\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"awareness\" (when emphasizing attentional aspect)\n- **Note**: Philosophy of Mind expert: in the framework, consciousness is the phenomenal field P from which 境 structures are constructed. This aligns with phenomenal consciousness (what-it's-like-ness). Phenomenology expert: when the author discusses 清醒 (lucid), this relates to reflective consciousness.\n\n---\n\n## 认知 (renzhi)\n\n- **Main translation**: cognition / cognitive structure\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"epistemic structure\" (when knowledge-focused)\n- **Note**: The framework distinguishes consciousness (意识, phenomenal field P) from cognition (认知, the category-theoretic structure 境 built upon P). Philosophy of Mind expert: aligns with embodied cognition and enactivism.\n\n---\n\n## 范畴 (fanchou)\n\n- **Main translation**: category\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"范畴论\" = \"category theory\" (the mathematical discipline)\n- **Translator's note**: TN at first occurrence of 范畴论 (8/10 majority): \"Category theory (范畴论) here refers to the mathematical discipline (Eilenberg-Mac Lane), not to Kant's table of categories (Kategorien), though the author's use of the term is alive to both senses.\" Frame as connection, never as warning. The Chinese term 范畴 bridges both the Kantian and mathematical senses; the author deliberately exploits this.\n- **Note**: Dual usage: (1) Kantian categories (pure concepts of understanding), (2) mathematical category theory (objects and morphisms). The author primarily uses sense (2) but the philosophical overlap with sense (1) is intentional. Kantian expert: the author replaces Kant's table of categories with category-theoretic structures -- universal properties replace categories, functors replace schematism, natural transformations replace synthetic unity of apperception.\n\n---\n\n## 泛性质 / 范性质 (fan xingzhi)\n\n- **Main translation**: universal property\n- **Alternatives**: None (standard mathematical terminology)\n- **Note**: From category theory. An object with universal property is characterized by its relationships to all other objects. The author uses this philosophically: universal properties in subcategories of E correspond to what we experience as \"essences\" -- this relocates essence from intrinsic nature to categorical position, from substance to structure. Kantian expert: formalizes what Kant called the \"schema\" of a concept. Wittgenstein expert: offers a structural account of what Wittgenstein calls \"family resemblance\" (PI §67) -- a universal property need not be a shared feature but rather a structural position (terminal or initial object) that relates to all objects in the category.\n\n---\n\n## 塔式结构 (ta shi jiegou)\n\n- **Main translation**: tower structure\n- **Alternatives**: None needed\n- **Note**: A category where morphisms are also objects, creating ascending levels. E has tower structure because associations (morphisms) are themselves experiences (objects). Formalized as T_0 -> T_1 -> T_2 -> ... -> T_infinity. Philosophy of Mind expert: provides formal model for meta-cognition and higher-order thought. Kantian expert: related to Fichte's reflexive self-positing.\n\n---\n\n## 基石 (jishi)\n\n- **Main translation**: base stone / foundation stone\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"base object\" (more technical)\n  - \"starting point\"\n- **Note**: In the tower-structure construction, base stones are objects designated as foundational. Choosing different base stones gives different \"constructions\" and thus different \"metaphysics.\" The metaphor of \"stone\" suggests solidity/foundation.\n\n---\n\n## 元阶 (yuan jie)\n\n- **Main translation**: meta-order\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"order\" (when clear from context)\n- **Note**: Technical term from the tower-structure construction. An object's \"absolute meta-order\" is which level it first appears; \"relative meta-order\" is defined relative to a chosen base stone. The 道德仁义礼 examples show how the same subcategory can be assigned different meta-orders depending on construction direction.\n\n---\n\n## 态射 / 箭头 (taishe / jiantou)\n\n- **Main translation**: morphism / arrow\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"mapping\" (less technical)\n- **Note**: Standard category theory terms. In the framework, morphisms are associations (联想) between experiences. Philosophy of Mind expert: \"morphisms are as ontologically basic as mental contents.\" The arrows-only formulation collapses the distinction between objects and morphisms at the fundamental level.\n\n---\n\n## 函子 (hanzi)\n\n- **Main translation**: functor\n- **Alternatives**: None (technical term)\n- **Note**: Structure-preserving map between categories. Key applications: evolution functor T: E_t -> E_{t+1} (cognitive development/change); inclusion functors (embedding subcategories); translation functors (mapping between domains). Kantian expert: \"the author's major methodological innovation beyond Kant -- Kant's framework is static; the author introduces dynamics via functors.\" Wittgenstein expert: the evolution of E corresponds to changes in one's form of life over time -- something Wittgenstein acknowledges but does not formalize.\n\n---\n\n## 自然变换 (ziran bianhua)\n\n- **Main translation**: natural transformation\n- **Alternatives**: None (technical term)\n- **Note**: The author's formalization of understanding (理解). A natural transformation between the evolution of formal structures and the evolution of experience is the condition of understanding. When the component is the identity morphism, this is mastery (掌握). Kantian expert: \"formalizes the schematism and extends it to meaning, aesthetics, and all understanding.\" Philosophy of Mind expert: \"meaning is neither in text/world nor in mind, but in the natural transformation between them.\" Wittgenstein expert: the key innovation is interpreting the component η_a as an *experience* -- the felt sense of confirmation or understanding. This bridges formal category theory and phenomenology. Always translate as \"natural transformation\" and preserve mathematical notation.\n\n---\n\n## 稳定结构 (wending jiegou)\n\n- **Main translation**: stable structure\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"invariant structure\" (mathematical contexts)\n  - \"structural invariant\"\n- **Note**: The structure S_E preserved under the evolution functor T. Formal counterpart to constancy (恒常). The author conjectures: there exists S_E such that T(S_E) is isomorphic to S_E. Kantian expert: corresponds to Kant's forms of intuition and categories but discovered empirically rather than deduced a priori. Wittgenstein expert: corresponds to the \"very general facts of nature\" (PI p. 230) and to hinge propositions (*On Certainty*) that form the stable framework of our world-picture.\n\n---\n\n## 稳定子范畴 (wending zi fanchou)\n\n- **Main translation**: stable subcategory\n- **Alternatives**: None\n- **Note**: The author conjectures that universal properties in stable subcategories of E correspond to what we experience as \"essences.\" Part of the formal apparatus that \"runs ahead of its interpretation.\"\n\n---\n\n## 认知结构 (renzhi jiegou)\n\n- **Main translation**: cognitive structure\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"epistemic structure\"\n- **Note**: Kantian expert: if part of the stable structure is shown to be necessary for constructing any E from P, it may be called \"cognitive structure\" -- this is a transcendental argument formalized categorically.\n\n---\n\n## 道 / 德 / 仁 / 义 / 礼 Sequence\n\n**Status**: RESOLVED (9/9 unanimous + translator, confirmed in Essay 4 draft review).\n\n**Convention**: 仁/义/礼 use our dictionary terms consistently throughout — NO split between block quote and analysis (unlike 德, which splits). The author does not reconceptualize 仁/义/礼 the way they reconceptualize 德; our terms are simply a better translation choice than the standard ones.\n\n**Laozi block quote convention**: Original 文言 in block quote → full English rendering with semantic weight. Attribution: \"adapted from Ivanhoe (2003)\" with TN citing standard translations and explaining departures. First occurrence: \"English (漢字, *pinyin*)\"; plain English thereafter.\n\n### 仁 (ren)\n\n- **Main translation**: humaneness (9/9 unanimous)\n- **Alternatives**: \"benevolence\" (Ivanhoe standard — declined: too external/active), \"fellow-feeling,\" \"Ren\" (transliterated — declined: kills philosophical experiment)\n- **Note**: Following Ames & Rosemont rather than Ivanhoe. Chinese Philosophy expert recommends \"humaneness\" over \"benevolence\" (too external/active). The author distinguishes 现象仁 (the inner feeling directed toward the other) from the theoretical concept. \"Humaneness\" captures the experiential, empathetic dimension and preserves the connection to what-it-is-to-be-human (crucial for the property→definition reversal). No split between block quote and analysis — the choice is a translation preference, not a conceptual departure.\n\n### 义 (yi)\n\n- **Main translation**: rightness (6-4 after debate, confirmed 9/9 in final review)\n- **Alternatives**: \"righteousness\" (Ivanhoe standard — declined: loaded in wrong direction, biblical/absolutist), \"moral impetus,\" \"sense of obligation\"\n- **Note**: \"Rightness\" captures the author's usage as motivational disposition — the driving force (推动力) connecting feeling (仁) to action (礼). \"Righteousness\" over-moralizes and imports judgment connotations the author strips away. In footnote [^3], 义 is glossed as \"what ought to be\" (应当), broader than action-specific. No split between block quote and analysis.\n\n### 礼 (li)\n\n- **Main translation**: ritual conduct (9/9 unanimous)\n- **Alternatives**: \"ritual,\" \"propriety,\" \"patterned behavior,\" \"the rites\" (Ivanhoe standard — declined: too abstract)\n- **Note**: \"Ritual conduct\" emphasizes the behavioral/observable dimension, critical because the author's argument begins from what we SEE (phenomenal ritual conduct) and INFERS the rest. Chinese Philosophy expert: the author distinguishes 现象礼 (observable behavioral patterns) from theoretical/normative 礼. No split between block quote and analysis.\n\n### 现象礼 / 现象仁 / 现象义\n\n- **Main translation**: phenomenal ritual conduct / phenomenal humaneness / phenomenal rightness\n- **Convention**: \"phenomenal X\" always — never dropped. The \"phenomenal\" prefix marks the author's distinction between the phenomenal ground and the metaphysical superstructure.\n- **Note**: The author's coinages distinguishing the original experiential basis from the metaphysical constructs. \"现象X\" = \"X as it appears in phenomena before being theorized.\" Crucial to the reversal argument.\n\n---\n\n## 祛魅 (qumei)\n\n- **Main translation**: disenchantment\n- **Alternatives**: None (standard translation of Weber's *Entzauberung*)\n- **Note**: What happens to Zeroth Reality in post-metaphysics: we recognize its \"special status\" was conferred by non-rational impulse, not by actual accessibility. Disenchantment is clarification, not loss.\n\n---\n\n## 终极实在 (zhongji shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: ultimate reality\n- **Alternatives**: \"absolute reality,\" \"fundamental reality\"\n- **Note**: What traditional metaphysics seeks -- technically designated as Zeroth Reality. The author shows this is structurally unreachable. Standard translation.\n\n---\n\n## 客观世界 (keguan shijie)\n\n- **Main translation**: objective world\n- **Alternatives**: \"external world\"\n- **Note**: Key move: \"the objective world is a model (模型) based on phenomena.\" Not metaphysical realism but constructive empiricism. Must be accompanied by notes explaining it is a constructed model (Second Reality).\n\n---\n\n## 同一 (tongyi)\n\n- **Main translation**: identity / sameness\n- **Alternatives**: None needed\n- **Note**: Connected to constancy. \"Causality is just temporal identity.\" Recognizing something as the same across time or context. Standard philosophical translation.\n\n---\n\n## 因果 (yinguo)\n\n- **Main translation**: causality / cause and effect\n- **Alternatives**: None needed\n- **Note**: The author's claim: \"causality is just temporal identity\" -- recognizing causal connections is recognizing constancy across time. Standard translation.\n\n---\n\n## 属性 (shuxing)\n\n- **Main translation**: property / attribute\n- **Alternatives**: \"characteristic\" (less technical)\n- **Note**: Used in the crucial move from property (属性) to definition (定义): what begins as contingent attribute becomes necessary essence. Standard translation.\n\n---\n\n## 定义 (dingyi)\n\n- **Main translation**: definition\n- **Alternatives**: \"to define\" (verbal)\n- **Note**: The transformation from 属性 (property) to 定义 (definition) is central to the author's constructivist account. From \"things CAN have X\" to \"things MUST have X to count as X.\"\n\n---\n\n## 死亡 (siwang)\n\n- **Main translation**: death\n- **Alternatives**: None\n- **Note**: Existentialism expert: philosophically crucial. The author argues death is transcendent (超越性) to oneself, making Heidegger's \"Being-toward-death\" impossible as articulated. \"We cannot actively care about the purpose of life; we can only care about the process of life.\"\n\n---\n\n## 荒谬 (huangmiu)\n\n- **Main translation**: absurdity / the absurd\n- **Alternatives**: \"absurdism\" (the philosophical position)\n- **Note**: Existentialism expert: the author dissolves Camus's absurdity through the cat-raising example, arguing absurdity is an artifact of misdirected intentionality (seeking meaning externally). When meaning is internally generated, absurdity vanishes.\n\n---\n\n## 异化 (yihua)\n\n- **Main translation**: alienation\n- **Alternatives**: \"estrangement,\" \"reification\"\n- **Note**: Existentialism expert: the author reinterprets Camus's absurdity through Marx's concept of alienation. \"When the source of meaning is externalized, the off-tone appears.\"\n\n---\n\n## 反叛 (fanpan)\n\n- **Main translation**: revolt / rebellion\n- **Alternatives**: \"defiance\"\n- **Note**: References Camus's *revolte*. The author reinterprets: revolt is itself internally generated meaning, effective but \"unnecessarily dramatic.\" The cat-raiser has gone beyond revolt.\n\n---\n\n## 自由 (ziyou)\n\n- **Main translation**: freedom\n- **Alternatives**: \"liberty\" (political contexts)\n- **Note**: Existentialism expert: relates to capacity to construct and choose among dreamscapes, but not absolute -- some dreamscapes are unavoidable. Freedom is practical and processual.\n\n---\n\n## 选择 (xuanze)\n\n- **Main translation**: choice\n- **Alternatives**: \"decision\"\n- **Note**: Choice is embedded in practical activity of 境-construction and navigation. The coin-flip example: choice as self-discovery through constructed decision-mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n## 主体间性 (zhuti jianxing)\n\n- **Main translation**: intersubjectivity\n- **Alternatives**: None (technical term)\n- **Note**: In the author's framework, intersubjectivity is grounded in **structural commensurability via natural transformations**. Two subjects are intersubjectively aligned when their respective natural transformations satisfy the same naturality conditions -- i.e., when their experiential responses are structurally constrained by the same categorical diagrams. The private content of experience drops out as irrelevant (cf. Wittgenstein's beetle-in-the-box, PI §293); what matters is structural position. Wittgenstein expert: this is perhaps the author's most significant contribution to the intersubjectivity problem -- not grounded in empathy (Husserl), communicative rationality (Habermas), or agreement in form of life (Wittgenstein), but in structural commensurability. In passages where the structural mechanism is foregrounded, \"structural commensurability\" may be clearer than \"intersubjectivity.\"\n\n---\n\n## 意向性 (yixiangxing)\n\n- **Main translation**: intentionality\n- **Alternatives**: None\n- **Note**: Husserl's *Intentionalitat*. Phenomenology expert: structurally encoded in the E-framework -- the tower structure captures the iterability of intentional acts. Not used frequently in the text but conceptually fundamental.\n\n---\n\n## 重整化 (chongzhenghua)\n\n- **Main translation**: renormalization\n- **Alternatives**: None (borrowed from physics)\n- **Note**: The author uses this to describe how macro-level phenomena emerge from micro-level phenomena. Metaphorical, describing phenomenological founding relations.\n\n---\n\n## 篮子 (lanzi)\n\n- **Main translation**: basket (metaphor for cognitive accessibility)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"accessible domain\" (functional)\n  - \"cognitive scope\" (abstract)\n  - \"horizon of thinkability\" (phenomenological)\n- **Note**: Philosophy of Mind expert: crucial metaphor for cognitive closure and thought's boundary. We can only think about what is in the basket. Engages with Colin McGinn's cognitive closure thesis.\n\n---\n\n## 自上而下 / 自下而上 (zì shàng ér xià / zì xià ér shàng)\n\n- **Main translation**: top-down / bottom-up\n- **Alternatives**: None needed\n- **Note**: Standard translations. Construction methods for the 道德仁义礼 hierarchy. The reversal between these two directions is central to the author's argument.\n\n---\n\n## 承认 (chengren)\n\n- **Main translation**: acknowledge / recognize\n- **Alternatives**: \"admit\" (when emphasizing acceptance of difficult truth)\n- **Note**: Buddhism expert: pivotal term. The author insists non-rationality \"should be acknowledged\" -- this is the pivot from nihilism to the poetic. Parallels Buddhist *yatha-bhuta* (seeing as it really is) but with different endpoint: lucid engagement rather than liberation.\n\n---\n\n## 空 (kong)\n\n- **Main translation**: emptiness (Buddhist, *sunyata*)\n- **Alternatives**: \"void,\" \"vacuity\"\n- **Note**: Buddhism expert: CRITICAL -- do NOT conflate with 虚无 (nihilistic void). Buddhist emptiness means absence of *svabhava* (inherent existence), not absence of phenomena. The author rarely uses 空 in technical Buddhist sense. When it appears, maintain strict distinction from 虚无.\n\n---\n\n## 无常 (wuchang)\n\n- **Main translation**: impermanence\n- **Alternatives**: \"impermanent\" (adjectival), \"transience\"\n- **Note**: Buddhist technical term (*anitya*). The author focuses on 恒常 (constancy) as the metaphysical drive rather than asserting impermanence. Buddhism expert: notable absence -- the author approaches from the phenomenology of our pursuit of stability.\n\n---\n\n## 缘起 (yuanqi)\n\n- **Main translation**: dependent origination\n- **Alternatives**: \"conditioned arising,\" \"interdependent co-arising\"\n- **Note**: Buddhism expert: though the term rarely appears explicitly, the author's core move embodies it. Objects are defined by morphisms (relations), not intrinsic content -- this is formal expression of *pratityasamutpada*. The tower structure resonates with Hua-yen's *shishi wuai* (interpenetration).\n\n---\n\n## 自性 (zixing)\n\n- **Main translation**: self-nature / inherent existence\n- **Alternatives**: \"intrinsic nature,\" \"*svabhava*\" (transliterated)\n- **Note**: Buddhism expert: Madhyamaka's target. The author rejects internal essences in favor of relational definition, recapitulating the Buddhist rejection of *svabhava* without using the term.\n\n---\n\n## 无我 (wuwo)\n\n- **Main translation**: non-self\n- **Alternatives**: \"no-self,\" \"selflessness\" (ethical), \"*anatman*\" (transliterated)\n- **Note**: Buddhism expert: core Buddhist doctrine. The author rarely uses this term explicitly but the category-theoretic definition of 我 (as universal property, not substance) functionally embodies the *anatman* teaching.\n\n---\n\n## P / E (Formal Symbols)\n\n- **Main translation**: P / E (retain letters)\n- **Gloss**: P = \"the phenomenal field\" or \"the totality of phenomena\"; E = \"Jing\" or \"the structured experiential field\"\n- **Note**: Retain in translation. P stands for Phenomenon, Physical World, Physics. E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, Experience. Full totality written in Fraktur (blackletter) script. Retain all formal notation.\n\n---\n\n## 语言游戏 (yuyan youxi)\n\n- **Main translation**: language game(s)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"language-game(s)\" (hyphenated, following Anscombe/Hacker translations of Wittgenstein)\n  - AVOID: \"linguistic game(s)\" (non-standard)\n- **Note**: Standard translation of Wittgenstein's *Sprachspiel(e)* (PI §7 ff.). The author uses this term explicitly in K1策略 but with a crucial difference: for Wittgenstein, language games are the irreducible unit of meaning -- the bedrock. For the author, language games are a *method* for discovering stable structures (S_L) that can be mapped onto experiential structures (S_E). Preserve \"language games\" since the author deliberately invokes the Wittgensteinian concept; add translator's note on first occurrence explaining the methodological reorientation. The hyphenated \"language-game\" signals closer fidelity to the Wittgensteinian original.\n\n---\n\n## 哲学治疗 (zhexue zhiliao)\n\n- **Main translation**: philosophical therapy\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"philosophical therapeutics\" (formal)\n- **Note**: Standard rendering of the late Wittgenstein's conception of philosophy as therapy (PI §133, §255). The author uses this in K1策略 to describe a process whose effectiveness the framework aims to *explain* structurally (through resolution of categorical tension / 张力). For Wittgenstein, philosophical therapy does not *have* an explanation -- it simply works when one achieves the \"perspicuous presentation\" (*ubersichtliche Darstellung*). Use \"philosophical therapy\" without qualification; the departure from Wittgenstein is explained in context.\n\n---\n\n## 结构 (jiegou)\n\n- **Main translation**: structure\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"categorical structure\" (in formal/category-theoretic contexts)\n- **Note**: \"Structure\" is standard and unproblematic. However, the author's use is technical: it refers to the categorical structure (objects + morphisms + composition) that E embodies. This is not \"structure\" in the structuralist linguistic sense (Saussure, Chomsky) nor in the Wittgensteinian sense of \"logical form\" (Tractatus). The author's structures are *experiential*. In contexts where the formal sense is paramount, \"categorical structure\" is clearer.\n\n---\n\n## 规则 (guize)\n\n- **Main translation**: rule(s)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"norm(s)\" (social/linguistic contexts)\n  - \"invariant\" / \"stable structure\" (when the author's structural sense is dominant)\n- **Note**: The author's \"rules\" are stable structures (S_E, S_L) preserved under functorial evolution -- closer to mathematical symmetries than to Wittgensteinian rules-as-practices. Wittgenstein argues rules do not determine their own application (PI §§185--202); the author's rules, as functorial invariants, are in a sense self-determining. When discussing linguistic or epistemic rules (语法规则 etc.), \"rule\" is standard. In category-theoretic contexts, \"invariant\" or \"stable structure\" may be more accurate.\n\n---\n\n## 演化 (yanhua)\n\n- **Main translation**: evolution\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"development\" (less technical)\n  - \"temporal progression\"\n- **Note**: Used for the evolution functor T_t: E_t → E_{t+1}. \"Evolution\" captures both temporal progression and structural transformation. Note that t is not necessarily physical time. In Wittgensteinian terms, the evolution of E corresponds to changes in one's form of life over time -- something Wittgenstein acknowledges but does not formalize.\n\n---\n\n## 张力 (zhangli)\n\n- **Main translation**: tension\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"strain\" / \"irresolution\"\n- **Note**: The author defines 张力 as the state where a subcategory lacks a unique terminal object -- where multiple potential universal properties compete without resolution. This is a structural account of philosophical puzzlement, indecision, and existential unease. In Wittgensteinian terms, corresponds to being \"entangled in our own rules\" (PI §125) or \"held captive by a picture\" (PI §115). \"Tension\" is adequate and standard.\n\n---\n\n## 内省 (neisheng)\n\n- **Main translation**: introspection\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"self-examination\"\n  - \"inner observation\"\n- **Note**: The author uses 内省 as a methodological tool: one can \"verify\" the categorical structure E through introspection -- by checking whether structural relationships match one's felt experience. Wittgenstein is deeply suspicious of introspection as philosophical method (PI §580: \"An 'inner process' stands in need of outward criteria\"). However, the author's use is more sophisticated: it is not about accessing private objects but about verifying structural positions, which are in principle publicly describable. This is compatible with Wittgenstein's insistence on public criteria.\n\n---\n\n## 哲学实验 (zhexue shiyan)\n\n- **Main translation**: philosophical experiment\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"experiential experiment\"\n  - \"phenomenological experiment\"\n- **Note**: The author's term for constructing examples with specific categorical structures to awaken specific experiences in readers/participants, then checking whether those experiences are replicable and occupy the predicted structural positions. The essays themselves function as philosophical experiments. No direct Wittgensteinian equivalent, but parallels Wittgenstein's use of examples as philosophical method (PI §593) and Austin's method of constructing speech-act scenarios. Key difference: the author proposes *designing experiments in advance* based on categorical structure, whereas Wittgenstein finds examples therapeutically.\n\n---\n\n## 对齐 (duiqi)\n\n- **Main translation**: alignment\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"correspondence\"\n  - \"attunement\" (Heideggerian contexts)\n  - \"concordance\"\n- **Note**: Describes the relationship between structural evolution and experiential evolution when a natural transformation exists. \"Alignment\" is clear and non-technical. \"Attunement\" (*Stimmung*) has Heideggerian resonances that may be appropriate in some contexts. In Wittgensteinian terms, corresponds to the state of being \"at home\" in a language game -- when one's responses naturally fit the game's structure.\n\n---\n\n## Additional Minor Terms\n\n### 天 (tian)\n- **Main translation**: Heaven (cosmological) / Nature (in compounds)\n- **Note**: Rarely used as technical term by the author. Standard in citations of classical philosophy.\n\n### 理 (li)\n- **Main translation**: principle (Neo-Confucian) / pattern\n- **Note**: Not deeply engaged by the author. Standard when it appears in citations.\n\n### 气 (qi)\n- **Main translation**: Qi (romanized) / material force\n- **Note**: Not extensively engaged by the author.\n\n### 性 (xing)\n- **Main translation**: nature / inherent nature\n- **Note**: Related to author's 德 but traditional 性 is more essentialist. Appears in citations.\n\n### 意境 (yijing)\n- **Main translation**: artistic conception / realm of meaning\n- **Note**: Classical Chinese aesthetic term. Distinct from technical 境 (Jing). Used in traditional sense.\n\n### 觉 / 悟 (jue / wu)\n- **Main translation**: awakening (觉) / realization (悟)\n- **Note**: Buddhist terms. The author deliberately avoids these, using 清醒 (lucid) instead. Maintain distinction.\n\n---\n\n# Disagreements Summary\n\nThis section collects all terms where expert dictionaries proposed genuinely different main translations, for the author's review and resolution.\n\n---\n\n### 1. 感受 (ganshou)\n\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: RESOLVED (10/10 unanimous confirmation).\n\n**Resolution**: \"Feeling\" as default rendering. \"Felt experience\" available when 感受 functions as a technical category label (naming a type of thing — \"any part of P\") rather than describing what someone feels. Related terms: 体验 → \"experience\" (processual/immersive), 经验 → \"experience\" (accumulated/epistemic; \"experiential\" adj; \"empirical experience\" for disambiguation), 感觉 → \"sensation.\" First-occurrence TN anchored to author's own two-sense definition (诗意 fn2). See main 感受 entry for full details, conventions, trigger criterion, and TN draft.\n\n---\n\n### 2. 诗意 (shiyi) — RESOLVED\n\n| Expert | Final Position |\n|--------|---------------|\n| All 10 (9 experts + translator-2) | the poetic |\n\n**Resolution**: \"The poetic\" as standard substantive (lowercase in running text). \"The Poetic\" capitalized in glossary, translator's introduction, and Essay 5 title. \"Poeticality\" acceptable but use sparingly — prefer \"poetic stance\" or \"poetic mode\" as noun variants. Unanimous (10/10).\n\n---\n\n### 3. 沉醉 / 沉醉的梦境 (chenzui / chenzui de mengjing) — RESOLVED\n\n| Expert | Final Position |\n|--------|---------------|\n| All 10 (9 experts + translator-2) | intoxicated |\n\n**Resolution**: \"Intoxicated\" unanimously confirmed after debate. Phil-mind and wittgenstein switched from \"immersed\"; phenomenology withdrew \"absorbed.\" Decisive argument: the author uses 投入 (engagement) and 沉浸 (immersion) for the LUCID dreamscape, so absorption/immersion is shared by both states. Only \"intoxicated\" marks the asymmetry — you can be lucid AND immersed, but not lucid AND intoxicated. TN on first occurrence clarifies: epistemic condition, not moral judgment.\n\n---\n\n### 4. 境界 (jingjie) — RESOLVED\n\n| Expert | Main Recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Metaphysics | boundary; horizon; limit |\n| Phenomenology | realm |\n| Epistemology | (not primary entry) |\n| Kantian | (not primary entry) |\n| Chinese Philosophy | realm / experiential realm |\n| Buddhism | bounds, horizon, domain-and-limit |\n\n**Resolution**: \"Bounds\" / \"horizon\" as default, following the author's own 界限 gloss. \"Realm\" acceptable only when emphasizing the domain rather than its limits. The -scape link does NOT apply (境界 is a reinforcing compound, not \"boundary of Jing\"). One footnote at line 25 of Essay 6 only — no note at line 17. See main entry for full rationale.\n\n---\n\n### 5. 构造 (gouzao) — RESOLVED\n\n| Expert             | Main Recommendation        |\n| ------------------ | -------------------------- |\n| Metaphysics        | construction               |\n| Phenomenology      | constitution               |\n| Epistemology       | construction               |\n| Philosophy of Mind | construction / structuring |\n| Kantian            | construction / constitute  |\n| Chinese Philosophy | (not primary entry)        |\n| Buddhism           | (not primary entry)        |\n\n**Resolution**: \"Construction\" as default; \"constitution\" only in explicitly Husserlian comparative passages. Author's decision.\n\n---\n\n### 6. 德 (de)\n\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: RESOLVED (9/9 unanimous final confirmation + translator).\n\n**Resolution**: \"(constitutive) character\" as main rendering. \"Virtue\" only in classical block quotes (Laozi, etc.). The shift from \"virtue\" (block quote) to \"(constitutive) character\" / \"character\" (analysis) enacts the author's reconceptualization — the only term in the 道德仁义礼 sequence that splits. See main 德 entry for full details, conventions, and TN draft.\n\n---\n\n### 7. 虚无 (xuwu)\n\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: RESOLVED (10/10 unanimous).\n\n**Resolution**: Context-dependent — \"nothingness\" (for the philosophical condition/absence) or \"the void\" (for spatial/experiential register). Translator chooses based on passage. NEVER \"emptiness\" (reserved for 空/sunyata). 虚无主义 = always \"nihilism.\" See main 虚无 entry for full conventions.\n\n---\n\n**End of Master Dictionary**\n\nThis document should be used as the authoritative reference for all translation decisions. Where disagreements remain unresolved, the author should make final determinations. All translators should maintain consistency with the choices recorded here.\n","numLines":1097,"startLine":1,"totalLines":1097}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"0f9e4ded-4876-45f4-a678-15a2d9f32e5d"}

The 境-family system is well-designed.\n\n2. **虚无 vs. 空** — Correct. The NEVER-use-\"emptiness\"-for-虚无 rule is non-negotiable and properly enforced. The dictionary correctly distinguishes the nihilistic void (虚无) from Buddhist sunyata (空). Kumarajiva's translation choice is implicitly honored.\n\n3. **清醒 → \"lucid\"** — Correct. Preserves overtones of bodhi/覺 without over-committing to Buddhist soteriology. Correctly avoids \"awakened\" (too Buddhist) and \"conscious\" (too Cartesian).\n\n4. **梦境 → \"dreamscape\"** — Correct. Preserves Diamond Sutra dream-simile resonance. The \"-scape\" suffix signals constructed environment without importing \"illusion\" (which would contradict the author's insistence on full engagement).\n\n5. **恒常 → \"constancy\"** — Correct. Properly distinguished from Buddhist anitya/无常. \"Permanence\" would have been wrong — too close to the Buddhist nitya that the author is analyzing rather than asserting.\n\n6. **德 → \"(constitutive) character\"** — Correct. The split convention (virtue in block quotes, character in analysis) is well-designed. Correctly avoids importing Buddhist svabhava connotations.\n\n7. **承认 → \"acknowledge/recognize\"** — Correct. This is the pivotal term where the author diverges from Buddhism (recognize and work with vs. overcome through insight). The dictionary captures this.\n\n8. **Buddhist technical terms (空, 无常, 缘起, 自性, 无我, 觉/悟)** — All correctly handled. Proper Sanskrit transliterations noted. Correct observation that the author deliberately avoids 觉/悟 in favor of 清醒.\n\n9. **境界 → \"bounds/horizon\"** — Correct. Following the author's own 界限 gloss. Correctly distinguished from technical 境 (Jing). The footnote placement decision (line 25 only) is sound.\n\n10. **我 → universal property (not substance)** — Correctly noted as convergent with Buddhist anatman/Middle Way on self. The dictionary properly frames this without reducing the author's independent achievement to Buddhist influence.\n\nNo concerns, no suggested changes. The dictionary is ready from the Buddhism perspective."}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"115e7fda-d579-4f20-bf14-9df3078aaf8e"}
