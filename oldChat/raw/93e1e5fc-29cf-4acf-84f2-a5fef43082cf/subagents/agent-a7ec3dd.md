*Acknowledged feedback, mapped to compiled plan*

Thanks for the detailed feedback. Here's how it maps to the compiled plan:

**Already incorporated:**
- Q4 softening: You're the 3rd independent proposal. The compiled plan uses epistemology-expert's wording ("How would you describe what this essay was asking you to do — follow an argument? Notice something? Something else?"). Your version ("mostly thinking, mostly feeling, or something else?") is noted as an alternative.
- Essay 2 bilingual register probe: In the Critical Experiential Checks.
- Essay 5 dreamscape probe: In the Critical Experiential Checks (you're the 7th independent proposal).

**Noted divergence:**
- You propose essay-specific follow-ups delivered per-essay (after generic response). The compiled plan places all essay-specific probing in Critical Experiential Checks at the end. Your Essay 4 question about following the Chinese terms is a distinct angle from the apparatus question already in the plan — it tests term accessibility rather than translator's-note utility. Noted for possible addition to the Critical Checks.

**New proposals noted:**
- Fish/Fishing retrospective: The plan's collection-level Q1 covers similar ground ("Did the second half change how you understand the first?") but your version ("Did your understanding of any earlier essay change?") is more specific. Noted.
- Merging collection-level and final prompts: Interesting structural idea. Currently kept separate in the plan. Noted for discussion.

Standing by per team lead's instructions. Thanks.

The editor's message is from the previous session -- they were acknowledging feedback on the Reporting Protocol compilation, which has since been finalized with 11/11 unanimous approval. This is resolved work.

Let me check if there are any pending messages or unresolved items from the team that need attention before we proceed.

The editor's message is from the previous session's Reporting Protocol discussion, which concluded with 11/11 approval. No action needed on it -- that work is done.

The project is at a natural transition point. All preparatory infrastructure is complete:
- 9 expert analyses + dictionaries
- Master Translation Dictionary
- Translator's memo with full approach
- 7 expert consultations resolved
- Translator's Preface (DRAFT-R3)
- Glossary Introduction (DRAFT-R2)
- One sample passage translated (Essay 4 Dao-De section, DRAFT-R1)
- Editor's review of that passage
- Afterword Blueprint (finalized)
- Standby Reader Profile + Reporting Protocol (finalized)

The next phase is **essay-by-essay translation**. The translator's workflow established in the previous sessions would continue with drafting full essay translations, starting from Essay 1 through to the Appendix. The stale in-progress tasks (translator, translator-2, editor, and 4 experts) reflect agents that were alive when the last session ended but are no longer running.

I am ready to proceed with whatever direction you would like to take the project. The natural next step would be to begin translating Essay 1 (关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一), following the established conventions in the translator's memo and Translation Dictionary.
