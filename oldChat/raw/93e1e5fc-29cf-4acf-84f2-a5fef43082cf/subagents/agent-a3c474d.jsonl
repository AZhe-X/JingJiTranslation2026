REMOVE INTERPOLATION: \"a feeling of concern for the other\" (draft line 38)**\n\nOriginal Chinese (line 24): 我对人时发乎于心的对他人感受\nDraft: \"the feeling that arises from within me when I face another person — a feeling of concern for the other\"\n\nProblem: \"a feeling of concern for the other\" is an interpolation. The Chinese says 对他人感受 — a feeling directed toward the other person. The author deliberately leaves the content unspecified because the POINT is the structural relationship (feeling → motivation → action), not the specific emotional content. Specifying \"concern\" narrows what the author left open.\n\nSuggested replacement: \"the feeling that arises from within my heart toward the other person\"\n\n---\n\n**2. 套用 → \"projected\" or \"imposed\" instead of \"applied\" (draft line 42)**\n\nOriginal Chinese (line 26): 将我对\"自己的'现象礼'\"的解释套用到了我们看到的别人所行的\"现象礼\"上\nDraft: \"I have merely **applied** my explanation of 'my own phenomenal ritual conduct' to the phenomenal ritual conduct we observe others performing.\"\n\nProblem: 套用 means to mechanically impose a template/pattern onto something — it's stronger than neutral \"applied.\" In philosophy of mind, this is analogical projection (simulation theory of mind-reading). The author is describing how we IMPOSE our first-person explanatory framework onto third-person observations.\n\nSuggested: \"I have merely **projected** my explanation of 'my own phenomenal ritual conduct' onto the phenomenal ritual conduct we observe others performing.\"\n\nAlternative: \"imposed\" or \"mapped...onto\" also work. \"Applied\" is too neutral for 套用.\n\n---\n\n**3. CONSISTENCY ON 发乎于心 — \"from within the heart\" (draft lines 38 and 46)**\n\nThe phrase 发乎于心 appears twice in the original:\n- Line 24: 发乎于心的对他人感受 → draft line 38 renders as \"arises from within me\" (drops 心)\n- Line 28: 发乎于心的而有的现象礼 → draft line 46 renders as \"arose from within the heart\" (keeps 心)\n\nProblem: Inconsistent. The first instance drops 心 (heart/mind), the second keeps it. 心 marks the interiority — the first-person phenomenal space. This is doing philosophical work: anchoring the asymmetry between what I feel inside (心) and what I observe externally.\n\nSuggested: Keep \"from within the heart\" in BOTH instances. This anchors the first-person interiority consistently.\n\n---\n\n**4. MINOR: Consider \"righteousness\" in the block quote only (draft line 34)**\n\nCurrent draft uses \"rightness\" throughout, including in the Laozi block quote. From the earlier team debate, I recommended \"righteousness\" in the block quote for performative reasons — the reader needs semantic weight to feel the cascade of loss in the philosophical experiment. \"Rightness\" is too light; the reader barely registers it as something being lost.\n\nIf the team has settled on \"rightness\" throughout, I defer. But the block quote's experimental force is weakened.\n\n---\n\n**WHAT WORKS WELL (no changes needed):**\n\n- 感受 → \"feeling\" throughout — consistent with dictionary, correct\n- 推动力 → \"driving force (*motivation*)\" — preserves both Chinese literal sense and author's English gloss\n- 切实 → \"actual\"/\"actually\" with bold emphasis — correctly marks the phenomenal/inferred boundary, crucial for the other-minds argument\n- Footnote [^3] translation — accurate, preserves \"is said to be\" distancing and bilingual play with \"motivation\"\n- Footnote [^4] — \"no longer within *my* phenomena\" — devastating one-sentence summary of the other-minds problem, precise\n- Property → definition reversal (draft line 44) — captures the inductive-to-normative shift cleanly\n- TN3 on 德 shift from \"virtue\" to \"character\" — well-handled\n- TN4 on property→definition mechanism — good reinforcement\n\n---\n\n**PHILOSOPHY-OF-MIND ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe passage is essentially a problem-of-other-minds argument disguised as Chinese metaphysics. The author's move: (1) I feel something when I act (first-person access), (2) I see others acting similarly (third-person observation), (3) I project my inner explanation onto them (analogical inference), (4) this projection gets universalized and reified into metaphysical categories. The draft captures this structure clearly. The four changes above sharpen the precision — especially #1 (don't over-specify the feeling content) and #2 (套用 as projection, not mere application).","summary":"Full phil-mind review for relay to translator-2"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":91,"cache_read_input_tokens":43097,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":91},"output_tokens":26,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY1aGdYHSCsTSnexoE1AC","type":"assistant","uuid":"0e0a1a25-69e5-4754-8bb9-4d9d221ec8b0","timestamp":"2026-02-11T03:30:57.748Z"}
