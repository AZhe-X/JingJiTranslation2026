But per our established 文言 convention, the first occurrence format is: \"English (德 De)\" — then plain English thereafter.\n\nThe question now is: what English word goes in that slot?\n\nOptions on the table:\n1. \"virtue (德 De)\" — then \"virtue\" in running text\n2. \"inherent character (德 De)\" — then \"inherent character\" in running text  \n3. \"defining character (德 De)\" — then \"defining character\" in running text\n4. \"character (德 De)\" — then \"character\" in running text\n5. Something else?\n\nRemember: this English word will be used in running text after the first glossed occurrence. It needs to work for the author's constructivist usage (what makes a thing what it is, constructed bottom-up from phenomena, applies to ALL things not just moral agents).\n\nWhat is your recommendation for the English part?\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"4ecfeb46-81dc-4ab5-b39b-65d3b5e43ac8","timestamp":"2026-02-11T00:53:23.583Z"}
