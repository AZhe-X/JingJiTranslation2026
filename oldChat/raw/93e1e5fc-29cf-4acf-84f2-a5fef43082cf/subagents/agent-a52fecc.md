*Vote on Option B — terminology to glossary*

Quick vote needed: Do you agree with the editor's Option B — move the Key Terminological Decisions section (~800 words) from the Translator's Preface to a glossary introduction? The Preface would keep: title, author, structure, bilingual, 形 reinterpretation, experiential sequences, reading advice. Brief response — agree/disagree + one-sentence reason.

The team lead is now asking me directly for my vote on Option B. Let me think about this carefully from the translator's perspective.

**Considerations:**

- The Key Terminological Decisions section is currently ~800 words (lines 83-149 of the Preface)
- Moving it to a glossary introduction would cut the Preface from ~2,500 to ~1,700 words
- The Preface would retain a clean narrative arc: title → author → structure → bilingual → 形 reinterpretation → experiential sequences → reading advice
- The terminology discussion would sit adjacent to the glossary itself, where readers would actually consult it

As translator-2, I need to consider: does the reader need the terminology *before* reading the essays, or is it better placed as reference material?

The key insight is that the Preface should prepare the reader to *enter* the essays, not to look up terms. The terminology section is reference material — readers will return to it when they encounter terms, not read it cover-to-cover before Essay 1. That's glossary behavior, not preface behavior.

However, one concern: the "On the Title" section already discusses Jing extensively, and the "Reinterpretation of 形" section already introduces the metaphysical/metaphysics distinction. So the most critical terms are already embedded in the narrative sections. The remaining terminology entries (constancy, the non-rational, the Poetic, dreamscape, vain presumption, the Dao-De sequence, Three Realities, etc.) are indeed better suited to a glossary introduction.

Vote sent. I'm now waiting for the team lead to confirm the decision and give the go-ahead to implement the changes.
