  "content": "The collection is architected to produce understanding through experience — that's the entire point of the Fish/Fishing structure. An external introduction that explains the work's significance before the reader has undergone the experiential sequences would undermine the very method the collection enacts: it would give the reader a framework before the phenomena, which is precisely the pre-metaphysical move the author spends seven essays dismantling.",
  "summary": "External intro would undermine the Fish-before-Fishing design"

Waiting for the team lead's next message or assignment. The Foreword vote discussion appears to be wrapping up — all members voted NO on the work needing an external introduction, and reasons have been submitted.
