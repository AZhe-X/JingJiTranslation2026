*Detailed answers on handling Essay 2's English text*

Good questions. Here are my answers from the epistemological perspective.

## 1. Leave untouched, but add a brief translator's note

Do not edit the author's English. But a short translator's note (either as a footnote at the essay's opening or as a brief prefatory paragraph) would significantly help readers who encounter this essay within the 境集 collection rather than as a standalone blog post. I would suggest a note covering three connections:

- **"Phenomena" = 现象 = First Reality (第一实在)**: Essay 2 introduces "phenomena" informally ("what we experience or observe"), and the later essays formalize this as 第一实在 and then as $\mathfrak{P}$. A reader of the full collection benefits from knowing these are the same concept at different levels of formalization.

- **"Digestion" of phenomena into belief anticipates the functor structure**: This is the most important conceptual bridge. In Essay 2, the author observes that phenomena must be "digested" (converted into thought) before they can serve as justification. In K1策略, this same process is formalized as the embedding functor $(F_{E,L})_t$ and the language-to-knowledge functor $(F_{L \to K})_t$. A brief note here would help technically minded readers see the continuity.

- **The three justification bases (phenomena, justified belief, truth) map onto the K1 framework**: Phenomena become objects in $\mathbb{E}_t$; justified beliefs become objects and morphisms in $(\mathcal{E}_K)_t$; truth is shown to be inaccessible, which motivates the entire project of studying $S_E$ through indirect means.

Keep the note short -- three to four sentences. The reader does not need the full mapping; they need enough to recognize the connections when they encounter the formal apparatus later.

## 2. The register difference is a feature -- preserve it

The register difference is epistemologically significant and should not be smoothed. Here is why:

Essay 2 is written in the register of analytic epistemology -- clear premises, numbered examples, explicit argumentation, sidenotes for technical elaboration. This is deliberate: the author is engaging the Western epistemological tradition on its own terms, using its own conventions. The argument (that JTB collapses into belief) is presented in the mode that analytic epistemologists expect.

Essays 1 and 3 are written in a thinking-aloud register -- more exploratory, more personal, with ideas developing in real time on the page. This reflects the Chinese essay tradition (随笔, which literally means "following the brush").

The fact that the author operates in both modes is itself philosophically meaningful within the collection. It demonstrates the very point the later essays make about different 境 (sub-categories of experience): the analytic register and the reflective register are different $(\mathcal{E}_i)_t$, each with their own stable structures ($S_L$ in English analytic prose vs. $S_L$ in Chinese 随笔), and the same philosophical insights can be expressed through either. Smoothing the register difference would erase this demonstration.

**Practical recommendation**: In the translated Chinese essays, do not try to match Essay 2's analytic register. Let them sound like what they are -- a Chinese thinker working through ideas in Chinese prose conventions. The register contrast will be productive for the reader.

## 3. Specific terms that need translator's footnotes

Three terms in Essay 2 warrant footnotes connecting them to the broader framework:

1. **"Digestion"** (used in: "to use a piece of phenomenon, we need not only to access it but also to convert it into thoughts, i.e., digestion"): This is the author's informal term for what becomes the functor $(F_{E,L})_t$ or more generally the process by which $\mathfrak{P}$ is organized into $\mathcal{E}$. A footnote: "This process is formalized in the K1 strategy as the embedding functor from phenomena into structured experience."

2. **"What each individual believes to be correct"** (the author's practical definition of knowledge): This is the informal predecessor of $(\mathcal{E}_K)_t$ -- the knowledge category at a given time. A footnote: "This concept is developed formally in '范畴论与境：K1策略' as the knowledge sub-category $(\mathcal{E}_K)_t$, where objects are beliefs and morphisms are justification relations."

3. **"Standard"** (used in "Knowledge in motion" sidenote: "there is usually a 'standard,' which is essentially a set of beliefs about 'which beliefs are better'"): This is the informal predecessor of the stable structure $S_K$. A footnote: "The concept of evaluative 'standards' within a knowledge community is formalized in the K1 strategy as the stable structure $S_K$ preserved under the evolution of the knowledge category."

I would NOT footnote "phenomena," "belief," or "truth" -- these are standard philosophical English terms and footnoting them would be patronizing. The translator's prefatory note (from question 1) is sufficient to flag the terminological continuity. Only footnote terms where the author's informal coinage has a specific formal counterpart in the later essays that a reader would not otherwise recognize.
