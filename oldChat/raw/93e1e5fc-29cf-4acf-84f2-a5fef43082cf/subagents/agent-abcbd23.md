*Review draft translation, send feedback to translator-2*

Please review the draft translation of the 道德仁义礼 passage from Essay 4 (后形而上学 整理).

**Original Chinese**: Read the original essay at: /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录/后形而上学 整理.md (lines 18-30 for the passage, and footnotes [^3], [^4], [^24] at lines 136-138, 172)

**Draft translation**: Read /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Draft/Essay4-DaoDeRenYiLi.md

Compare the draft against the original Chinese carefully. Then send your comments, suggestions, agreements, and any concerns **directly to translator-2** via message. Focus on your area of expertise (Kantian/transcendental philosophy) — the constructivist argument structure, the constitutive character concept, the phenomenal-to-metaphysical inversion.

Now let me carefully compare the draft against the original and prepare my expert review focusing on the Kantian/transcendental dimensions.

Review sent to translator-2. I focused on three main areas from the Kantian/transcendental perspective:

1. **The constructivist inversion** — the passage's core move (bottom-up construction concealed as top-down generation) is well-rendered
2. **Terminological precision** — suggested adding "(德)" at the first analysis occurrence of "character" and using hyphenated "meta-physics" for 元物理 to preserve the author's etymological self-consciousness
3. **The property-to-definition reversal** — flagged the parallel to Kant's a posteriori / a priori distinction and suggested the word "constitutes" to bridge to "(constitutive) character"

The draft is strong overall; my suggestions are refinements rather than structural corrections.
