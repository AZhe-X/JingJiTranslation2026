*Update reports re: intersubjectivity and philosophical experiments*

Follow-up: Based on the discussion we just had about intersubjectivity via η and the essays as philosophical experiments, please review your Analysis Report in your workspace directory:

/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/[Your Field]/Analysis Report.md

If your report mentions intersubjectivity or philosophical experiments, please update those sections to reflect the deeper understanding we've now reached. Specifically:

1. If you mentioned intersubjectivity — update to reflect the η-based structural commensurability account.
2. If you mentioned philosophical experiments — update to identify specific passages that function as experiments on the reader, and note the translation implication (experiential sequence is load-bearing, not merely illustrative).

If your report does NOT mention either topic, you may add a brief section if you think it's warranted, or skip this update if it's not relevant to your field.

Read your report first, then edit only the relevant sections. Do not rewrite the whole report.

Let me read my current report first.

My report does not currently mention intersubjectivity or philosophical experiments. Both are highly relevant to epistemology, so I'll add two new sections -- one on intersubjectivity via eta (after section 6 on Meno), and one on philosophical experiments (after the new intersubjectivity section, before the translation challenges). I'll also add a corresponding entry to the "What Is Achieved" list in section 8. Let me make these edits.

Now let me notify the team lead.

  "content": "I've updated my Analysis Report at `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L.

## Claude at 2026-02-10 20:18:49

The report has been updated with three targeted additions:
- **Section 6a** on intersubjectivity via eta (structural commensurability, bypassing qualia and truth-access)
- **Section 6b** on philosophical experiments (specific passages identified with translation implications)
- **Section 8** expanded with two new entries in the "What Is Achieved" list

The rest of the report remains unchanged.
