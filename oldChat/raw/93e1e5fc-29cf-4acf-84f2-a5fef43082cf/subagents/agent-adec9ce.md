*AGREE with final proposal, no objections*

AGREE.

All three Preface edits are clean, principled, and final. The Afterword blueprint is comprehensive and well-structured. My three amendments from the previous round — the intoxicated/lucid dreamscape as resolution of the bad faith/authenticity problematic, the critique of Being-toward-death, and the intersubjectivity solution via eta — are all incorporated. The "livability" point is correctly placed in the existentialist positioning section. No further objections.
