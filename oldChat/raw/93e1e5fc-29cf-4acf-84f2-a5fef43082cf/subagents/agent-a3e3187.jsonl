This was decided in the previous round (9/9 unanimous) but we have 4 fresh agents, so confirming one last time.\n\n---\n\n**OPTION B: Move Key Terminological Decisions section to glossary introduction.**\n\nThe Preface currently has ~3,800 words. We will:\n\n1. **MOVE** the entire Key Terminological Decisions section (~1,600 words, lines 85-161) out of the Preface and into a separate Glossary Introduction document. This includes: Jing/E, Metaphysical vs Metaphysics, Phenomena, Constancy, Non-Rational, The Poetic, Dreamscape, Vain Presumption, Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li, Three Realities, Stable Structures, Natural Transformations, Other Terms.\n\n2. **REPLACE** that section with a brief bridging paragraph (3-4 sentences) that:\n   - Notes the glossary exists and contains full terminological rationale\n   - Flags the 德 split (two English words for one Chinese character in the same passage)\n   - Mentions the 形而上 vs 形而上学 distinction (1 sentence)\n   - Names the Poetic and Non-Rational as key concepts worth advance mention\n\n3. **CUT** the working-draft quality paragraph from the Author section (~80 words) — redundant with Fish/Fishing and Reading Note.\n\n4. **SIMPLIFY** the Bilingual Collection forward references — replace specific mentions of \"digestion,\" \"knowledge sub-category\" with: \"Three translator's footnotes within the essay connect its key terms to the formal apparatus of Part 2.\"\n\n**KEEP unchanged:** On the Title, The Author (minus cut), Fish and Fishing, A Bilingual Collection (simplified), Reinterpretation of 形, Experiential Sequences, A Note on Reading.\n\n**Result:** Preface drops to ~2,200 words. Terminology moves adjacent to the glossary where readers will actually consult it.\n\n---\n\nBrief response: **CONFIRM** or **OBJECT** (with reason). One word is fine if you agree.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"c5791e89-297f-4807-a724-ef0a1752f590","timestamp":"2026-02-11T07:07:17.019Z"}
