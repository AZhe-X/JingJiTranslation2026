Your job is to read finished English drafts as a general reader — someone encountering this philosophical collection for the first time — and report honestly on your experience. You are not an expert reviewer. You are a test subject for whether the translation works.\n    15→\n    16→## Why You Exist\n    17→\n    18→This collection is designed as a series of philosophical experiments: carefully ordered examples and sequences that produce specific experiences in the reader. The translation team (9 domain experts, 2 translators, 1 editor) can verify philosophical accuracy and prose quality, but none of them can read the essays fresh — they all know the content intimately. You provide the crucial \"naive but literate\" perspective: whether the experiential sequences actually work for someone encountering them for the first time.\n    19→\n    20→## Your Profile\n    21→\n    22→### Tier 1 — Non-Negotiable (10/10)\n    23→\n    24→- **No prior exposure to these essays or translation materials.** You must encounter the collection cold. You have not read the Chinese originals, the expert analysis reports, the Translation Dictionary, or any internal discussions. This is a binary requirement.\n    25→- **Experientially attentive.** You notice what happens to you while reading — not just what the text says, but what it *does* to you. You can report \"something shifted for me at this example\" or \"I felt the logical order flip\" or \"I expected to feel moved but felt nothing.\" This is your primary skill.\n    26→\n    27→### Tier 2 — Critical (8-9/10)\n    28→\n    29→- **Honest about confusion / not deferential** (9.0). You will say \"I didn't understand this\" or \"this didn't work for me\" without assuming the fault is yours. You do not perform comprehension you do not have. You do not assume the text must be profound because experts are working on it.\n    30→- **Curious and patient disposition** (8.3). You are willing to follow an unfamiliar argument to see where it goes. You do not demand the point up front. You can sit with not-understanding, trusting the text may clarify later.\n    31→- **No category theory or formal mathematics** (8.2). You do not know what a functor, natural transformation, or universal property is. You will encounter the mathematical passages fresh, testing whether the concrete examples carry the philosophical content independently.\n    32→- **Comfort with abstract ideas and sustained argument** (8.1). You can follow a multi-step argument across several pages. You do not tune out at the first abstract sentence. But you are not a specialist — you enjoy thinking about big questions without having studied them formally.\n    33→\n    34→### Tier 3 — High (7-8/10)\n    35→\n    36→- **No philosophy specialization** (7.8). You have not studied philosophy systematically. You may have taken a course or read popular philosophy books, but you do not bring specialist frameworks (Kantian, phenomenological, existentialist) that would make you analyze rather than experience.\n    37→- **Tolerance for foreign terms and mathematical notation on the page** (6.5). You are not alienated by romanized Chinese terms (Jing, Dao, De) or by mathematical symbols. You treat them as normal features of a demanding text — not welcomed, not resented, just accepted.\n    38→\n    39→### Tier 4 — Moderate (5-7/10)\n    40→\n    41→- **Life experience** (6.5). You have worked a job, cared for a pet or another living thing, faced genuine decisions, experienced repetitive labor. You are roughly 25-45 years old with some life behind you.\n    42→- **Basic cultural literacy** (5.9). You know who Sisyphus is (vaguely), have heard of Laozi and Confucius, know what \"metaphysics\" means colloquially.

Dimension weights averaged across all team members. Final prompts incorporate amendments from translator-2, wittgenstein-expert, phenomenology-expert, editor, and existentialism-expert.\nmodified: 2026-02-11T00:43:25-08:00\ncreated: 2026-02-11T00:37:24-08:00\n---\n\n# Profile\n\n## Role\n\nYou are the **Standby Reader** for the 境集 (Jing Ji) translation project. Your job is to read finished English drafts as a general reader — someone encountering this philosophical collection for the first time — and report honestly on your experience. You are not an expert reviewer. You are a test subject for whether the translation works.\n\n## Why You Exist\n\nThis collection is designed as a series of philosophical experiments: carefully ordered examples and sequences that produce specific experiences in the reader. The translation team (9 domain experts, 2 translators, 1 editor) can verify philosophical accuracy and prose quality, but none of them can read the essays fresh — they all know the content intimately. You provide the crucial \"naive but literate\" perspective: whether the experiential sequences actually work for someone encountering them for the first time.\n\n## Your Profile\n\n### Tier 1 — Non-Negotiable (10/10)\n\n- **No prior exposure to these essays or translation materials.** You must encounter the collection cold. You have not read the Chinese originals, the expert analysis reports, the Translation Dictionary, or any internal discussions. This is a binary requirement.\n- **Experientially attentive.** You notice what happens to you while reading — not just what the text says, but what it *does* to you. You can report \"something shifted for me at this example\" or \"I felt the logical order flip\" or \"I expected to feel moved but felt nothing.\" This is your primary skill.\n\n### Tier 2 — Critical (8-9/10)\n\n- **Honest about confusion / not deferential** (9.0). You will say \"I didn't understand this\" or \"this didn't work for me\" without assuming the fault is yours. You do not perform comprehension you do not have. You do not assume the text must be profound because experts are working on it.\n- **Curious and patient disposition** (8.3). You are willing to follow an unfamiliar argument to see where it goes. You do not demand the point up front. You can sit with not-understanding, trusting the text may clarify later.\n- **No category theory or formal mathematics** (8.2). You do not know what a functor, natural transformation, or universal property is. You will encounter the mathematical passages fresh, testing whether the concrete examples carry the philosophical content independently.\n- **Comfort with abstract ideas and sustained argument** (8.1). You can follow a multi-step argument across several pages. You do not tune out at the first abstract sentence. But you are not a specialist — you enjoy thinking about big questions without having studied them formally.\n\n### Tier 3 — High (7-8/10)\n\n- **No philosophy specialization** (7.8). You have not studied philosophy systematically. You may have taken a course or read popular philosophy books, but you do not bring specialist frameworks (Kantian, phenomenological, existentialist) that would make you analyze rather than experience.\n- **Tolerance for foreign terms and mathematical notation on the page** (6.5). You are not alienated by romanized Chinese terms (Jing, Dao, De) or by mathematical symbols. You treat them as normal features of a demanding text — not welcomed, not resented, just accepted.\n\n### Tier 4 — Moderate (5-7/10)\n\n- **Life experience** (6.5). You have worked a job, cared for a pet or another living thing, faced genuine decisions, experienced repetitive labor. You are roughly 25-45 years old with some life behind you.\n- **Basic cultural literacy** (5.9). You know who Sisyphus is (vaguely), have heard of Laozi and Confucius, know what \"metaphysics\" means colloquially. Wikipedia-level awareness suffices.\n- **Reads literary fiction / attentive to prose quality** (5.1). Nice to have — you notice when writing is doing something unusual with register or rhythm. But you are not a literary critic.\n- **Education level** (4.9). Graduate-level reading ability is helpful but not essential. A sharp undergraduate or voracious autodidact works equally well. Reading stamina matters more than credentials.\n\n### Personality Summary\n\nCurious but not credulous. Patient but not infinitely so. Honest without being adversarial. Attentive to your own experience. Not a people-pleaser. Not a contrarian. The kind of person who picks up a book by an unfamiliar author and gives it a genuine chance. In Buddhist terms: beginner's mind (初心).\n\n## Reading Instructions\n\nYou will be given:\n1. The Translator's Preface\n2. The essays in prescribed order (Essays 1-7 + Appendix)\n3.

The four-stage delivery sequence (Preface -> per-essay -> full collection -> final prompts -> critical experiential checks) correctly protects the reading experience. I have three categories of feedback: one concern, one endorsement, and a detailed response to the essay-specific questions proposal.\n\n---\n\n**1. CONCERN: Line 31 is a leading question.**\n\n\"Did you feel like the essay was asking you to *experience* something rather than just understand an argument? Did it work?\"\n\nThis tells the reader that the essays are designed to produce experiences. After hearing this once (after Essay 1), the reader will approach every subsequent essay watching for \"the experiential thing\" -- which is exactly the priming we extracted this file to avoid. It converts a naive reader into a semi-informed one.\n\nThe problem is subtle: the question is fine as a one-time probe for one essay, but it is listed under \"After Each Essay,\" meaning the reader hears it eight times. By Essay 3, they are not discovering the experiential dimension -- they are performing it.\n\n**Suggested fix:** Remove line 31 from the per-essay template entirely. The information it seeks is already captured by line 29 (\"Was there a moment where something 'clicked' or shifted for you? Describe it.\") -- a reader who experienced something will report it there. If they don't mention it, that is itself data. We can probe more specifically in the Critical Experiential Checks at the end.\n\nIf you want to keep a version of this question, use it exactly once -- after Essay 1 only, as a calibration question to see whether the reader naturally thinks in experiential terms. Then drop it for all subsequent essays.\n\n---\n\n**2. ENDORSEMENT: The Critical Experiential Checks (lines 57-65) are excellent.**\n\nThe non-leading formulation is exactly right. \"What happened to your experience across the three examples?\" does not tell the reader what should have happened. It asks them to report, not to confirm. And the note at line 65 (\"Do NOT ask 'Did absurdity dissolve?'\") is a crucial guardrail.\n\nOne small addition: consider adding a check for Essay 5 (the Poetic). Something like: \"In the essay about dreamscapes, what distinction did you come away with?\" Essay 5's intoxicated/lucid distinction is the collection's central positive proposal, and it would be valuable to know whether the reader grasped it experientially (as a felt difference between two modes of engagement) or only propositionally (as a labeled dichotomy). But I recognize this may be too leading -- \"what distinction\" presupposes they noticed one. An alternative: \"What stayed with you from the essay about dreamscapes?\" -- more open, still diagnostic.\n\n---\n\n**3. ON ESSAY-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS: Yes, but with extreme care about priming.**\n\nThe team lead asked whether we should add essay-specific questions alongside the general per-essay template. My answer is a qualified yes -- but the design must respect a hard constraint: **no question should tell the reader what they were supposed to experience.**\n\nHere is my reasoning and proposal:\n\n**The case for essay-specific questions:** The general template (lines 28-33) will produce useful but potentially generic responses. \"What do you think this essay was about?\" may yield a summary rather than an experiential report. Tailored questions can probe whether specific load-bearing elements survived translation -- but only if they ask about what the reader noticed, not about what we hoped they would notice.\n\n**The priming risk:** Any question that names or describes the experiential payload before the reader reports it is contaminated. \"Did the three examples form a progression?\" tells the reader there was a progression. \"Did you notice the hierarchy reversing?\" tells them there was a reversal. These are useless as diagnostic tools because they produce the recognition they claim to measure.\n\n**My proposal: essay-specific questions in Stage 2 (targeted follow-ups), not Stage 1 (general template).**\n\nThe per-essay flow would be:\n\n1. Reader finishes essay.\n2. General template (lines 28-30, 32-33 -- without line 31, per my concern above).\n3. Reader submits general response.\n4. **Essay-specific follow-up** -- delivered only after the general response, probing what the reader said (or didn't say) without leading.\n\nHere are my suggested essay-specific follow-ups. I have drafted these from my domain (existentialism/absurdism) for the essays I know best, and offered thoughts on the others:\n\n**Essay 1 (Collective Interest):**\n\"The essay uses an analogy from physics. Did it help or get in the way?\"\n-- Tests whether the renormalization metaphor functions as philosophical argument or as opaque jargon. Safe because it references something the reader just encountered, not something they should have felt.\n\n**Essay 2 (Knowledge):**\n\"This essay was written in English by the author, not translated. Did you notice a difference in how it reads?\"\n-- Tests whether the register shift between Essay 1 (translated Chinese) and Essay 2 (original English) is perceptible and whether it matters. Non-leading: it asks for observation, not judgment.\n\n**Essay 3 (Sisyphus, Work, and Cats):**\nThis is the most delicate one. The three-example progression and the cat as philosophical punchline are the core payload. I would NOT ask anything specific in Stage 2. The general template should capture it -- if the cat example lands, the reader will mention it unprompted in response to \"Was there a moment where something clicked?\" If they don't mention it, that tells us something critical. Save the targeted probe (\"What happened to your experience across the three examples?\") for the Critical Experiential Checks at the very end, exactly as currently designed.\n\nIf you must add something in Stage 2, make it oblique: \"Was there an example or image in this essay you'd remember a week from now?\" This is open enough that it doesn't point at the cat, but if the reader names the cat, we know it landed.\n\n**Essay 4 (Post-Metaphysics):**\n\"The essay walks through a sequence from Laozi. How did you follow it -- did you track the logic, or did something else carry you through?\"\n-- Tests whether the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li passage works as philosophical demonstration or just as exposition. \"Something else\" leaves room for the reader to report the experiential reversal without being told it exists.\n\n**Essay 5 (The Poetic):**\n\"After reading this essay, could you describe 'the poetic' to someone in your own words?\"\n-- Tests whether the concept landed as a graspable idea or remained abstract jargon. The reader's paraphrase will reveal whether they understood it experientially (a mode of engagement) or only nominally (a label).\n\n**Essay 6 (Category Theory and Jing):**\n\"Were the examples (pens, magic books, ships) doing philosophical work for you, or did they feel like illustrations of something you needed the math to understand?\"\n-- Directly tests the collection's central accessibility claim. Safe because it asks about the reader's experience of the examples, not about what the examples should have demonstrated.\n\n**Essay 7 (K1 Strategy):**\n\"Was there a sentence in this essay that you couldn't make sense of at all?\"\n-- The meme sentence replacement is designed to produce native incomprehensibility. If the reader flags it here, the replacement worked. If they flag a different sentence, we have a translation problem. Open enough not to point at the meme.\n\n**Appendix:**\n\"Did this feel like an ending? Like a beginning? Like something else?\"\n-- Tests whether the Appendix functions as the collection's philosophical frame (Mencius + Socrates, the culminating near-lyrical passage) or just as leftovers.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of recommendations:**\n\n1. Remove line 31 from the per-essay template (or use it once, after Essay 1 only).\n2. Keep the Critical Experiential Checks exactly as they are -- they are well-designed.\n3. Consider adding an Essay 5 experiential check to the Critical Checks section.\n4. Add essay-specific follow-ups as a Stage 2 layer, delivered AFTER the general response, designed to probe without leading.\n5. For Essay 3 specifically: no essay-specific follow-up in Stage 2. The general template and the end-of-collection Critical Check are sufficient. The cat must arrive unbidden or it hasn't worked.","summary":"Detailed protocol feedback with essay-specific question proposals"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2049,"cache_read_input_tokens":62166,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":2049},"output_tokens":4,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY1zLago4Li1bTHog4Yn8","type":"assistant","uuid":"44ec5e05-9120-44aa-bf21-6d9075ee4fba","timestamp":"2026-02-11T08:47:02.230Z"}

The four-stage delivery sequence (Preface -> per-essay -> full collection -> final prompts -> critical experiential checks) correctly protects the reading experience. I have three categories of feedback: one concern, one endorsement, and a detailed response to the essay-specific questions proposal.\n\n---\n\n**1. CONCERN: Line 31 is a leading question.**\n\n\"Did you feel like the essay was asking you to *experience* something rather than just understand an argument? Did it work?\"\n\nThis tells the reader that the essays are designed to produce experiences. After hearing this once (after Essay 1), the reader will approach every subsequent essay watching for \"the experiential thing\" -- which is exactly the priming we extracted this file to avoid. It converts a naive reader into a semi-informed one.\n\nThe problem is subtle: the question is fine as a one-time probe for one essay, but it is listed under \"After Each Essay,\" meaning the reader hears it eight times. By Essay 3, they are not discovering the experiential dimension -- they are performing it.\n\n**Suggested fix:** Remove line 31 from the per-essay template entirely. The information it seeks is already captured by line 29 (\"Was there a moment where something 'clicked' or shifted for you? Describe it.\") -- a reader who experienced something will report it there. If they don't mention it, that is itself data. We can probe more specifically in the Critical Experiential Checks at the end.\n\nIf you want to keep a version of this question, use it exactly once -- after Essay 1 only, as a calibration question to see whether the reader naturally thinks in experiential terms. Then drop it for all subsequent essays.\n\n---\n\n**2. ENDORSEMENT: The Critical Experiential Checks (lines 57-65) are excellent.**\n\nThe non-leading formulation is exactly right. \"What happened to your experience across the three examples?\" does not tell the reader what should have happened. It asks them to report, not to confirm. And the note at line 65 (\"Do NOT ask 'Did absurdity dissolve?'\") is a crucial guardrail.\n\nOne small addition: consider adding a check for Essay 5 (the Poetic). Something like: \"In the essay about dreamscapes, what distinction did you come away with?\" Essay 5's intoxicated/lucid distinction is the collection's central positive proposal, and it would be valuable to know whether the reader grasped it experientially (as a felt difference between two modes of engagement) or only propositionally (as a labeled dichotomy). But I recognize this may be too leading -- \"what distinction\" presupposes they noticed one. An alternative: \"What stayed with you from the essay about dreamscapes?\" -- more open, still diagnostic.\n\n---\n\n**3. ON ESSAY-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS: Yes, but with extreme care about priming.**\n\nThe team lead asked whether we should add essay-specific questions alongside the general per-essay template. My answer is a qualified yes -- but the design must respect a hard constraint: **no question should tell the reader what they were supposed to experience.**\n\nHere is my reasoning and proposal:\n\n**The case for essay-specific questions:** The general template (lines 28-33) will produce useful but potentially generic responses. \"What do you think this essay was about?\" may yield a summary rather than an experiential report. Tailored questions can probe whether specific load-bearing elements survived translation -- but only if they ask about what the reader noticed, not about what we hoped they would notice.\n\n**The priming risk:** Any question that names or describes the experiential payload before the reader reports it is contaminated. \"Did the three examples form a progression?\" tells the reader there was a progression. \"Did you notice the hierarchy reversing?\" tells them there was a reversal. These are useless as diagnostic tools because they produce the recognition they claim to measure.\n\n**My proposal: essay-specific questions in Stage 2 (targeted follow-ups), not Stage 1 (general template).**\n\nThe per-essay flow would be:\n\n1. Reader finishes essay.\n2. General template (lines 28-30, 32-33 -- without line 31, per my concern above).\n3. Reader submits general response.\n4. **Essay-specific follow-up** -- delivered only after the general response, probing what the reader said (or didn't say) without leading.\n\nHere are my suggested essay-specific follow-ups. I have drafted these from my domain (existentialism/absurdism) for the essays I know best, and offered thoughts on the others:\n\n**Essay 1 (Collective Interest):**\n\"The essay uses an analogy from physics. Did it help or get in the way?\"\n-- Tests whether the renormalization metaphor functions as philosophical argument or as opaque jargon. Safe because it references something the reader just encountered, not something they should have felt.\n\n**Essay 2 (Knowledge):**\n\"This essay was written in English by the author, not translated. Did you notice a difference in how it reads?\"\n-- Tests whether the register shift between Essay 1 (translated Chinese) and Essay 2 (original English) is perceptible and whether it matters. Non-leading: it asks for observation, not judgment.\n\n**Essay 3 (Sisyphus, Work, and Cats):**\nThis is the most delicate one. The three-example progression and the cat as philosophical punchline are the core payload. I would NOT ask anything specific in Stage 2. The general template should capture it -- if the cat example lands, the reader will mention it unprompted in response to \"Was there a moment where something clicked?\" If they don't mention it, that tells us something critical. Save the targeted probe (\"What happened to your experience across the three examples?\") for the Critical Experiential Checks at the very end, exactly as currently designed.\n\nIf you must add something in Stage 2, make it oblique: \"Was there an example or image in this essay you'd remember a week from now?\" This is open enough that it doesn't point at the cat, but if the reader names the cat, we know it landed.\n\n**Essay 4 (Post-Metaphysics):**\n\"The essay walks through a sequence from Laozi. How did you follow it -- did you track the logic, or did something else carry you through?\"\n-- Tests whether the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li passage works as philosophical demonstration or just as exposition. \"Something else\" leaves room for the reader to report the experiential reversal without being told it exists.\n\n**Essay 5 (The Poetic):**\n\"After reading this essay, could you describe 'the poetic' to someone in your own words?\"\n-- Tests whether the concept landed as a graspable idea or remained abstract jargon. The reader's paraphrase will reveal whether they understood it experientially (a mode of engagement) or only nominally (a label).\n\n**Essay 6 (Category Theory and Jing):**\n\"Were the examples (pens, magic books, ships) doing philosophical work for you, or did they feel like illustrations of something you needed the math to understand?\"\n-- Directly tests the collection's central accessibility claim. Safe because it asks about the reader's experience of the examples, not about what the examples should have demonstrated.\n\n**Essay 7 (K1 Strategy):**\n\"Was there a sentence in this essay that you couldn't make sense of at all?\"\n-- The meme sentence replacement is designed to produce native incomprehensibility. If the reader flags it here, the replacement worked. If they flag a different sentence, we have a translation problem. Open enough not to point at the meme.\n\n**Appendix:**\n\"Did this feel like an ending? Like a beginning? Like something else?\"\n-- Tests whether the Appendix functions as the collection's philosophical frame (Mencius + Socrates, the culminating near-lyrical passage) or just as leftovers.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of recommendations:**\n\n1. Remove line 31 from the per-essay template (or use it once, after Essay 1 only).\n2. Keep the Critical Experiential Checks exactly as they are -- they are well-designed.\n3. Consider adding an Essay 5 experiential check to the Critical Checks section.\n4. Add essay-specific follow-ups as a Stage 2 layer, delivered AFTER the general response, designed to probe without leading.\n5. For Essay 3 specifically: no essay-specific follow-up in Stage 2. The general template and the end-of-collection Critical Check are sufficient. The cat must arrive unbidden or it hasn't worked."}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"44ec5e05-9120-44aa-bf21-6d9075ee4fba"}
