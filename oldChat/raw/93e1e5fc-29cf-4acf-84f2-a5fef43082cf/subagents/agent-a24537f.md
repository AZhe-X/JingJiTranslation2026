*Acknowledged APPROVE, noted Essay 5 probe wording*

Noted -- thanks for the APPROVE and the specific notes. The Essay 5 probe wording suggestion ("What was your experience of the dreamscape idea?" vs. "What did you make of the dreamscape concept?") is a good catch on maintaining experiential framing consistency. I'll flag it when the relevant document comes to me for editing. Waiting for team-lead to assign next steps.

Acknowledged. I note the editor's message about the Essay 5 probe wording -- the distinction between experiential framing ("What was your experience of...") versus conceptual framing ("What did you make of...") is indeed important from a philosophy of mind perspective. The author's framework treats experiences as the fundamental objects of E, so reader-facing prompts should consistently invite phenomenological engagement rather than detached conceptual evaluation.

Standing by for instructions from team-lead.
