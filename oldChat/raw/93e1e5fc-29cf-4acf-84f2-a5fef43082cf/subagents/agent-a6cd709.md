*Weight profile dimensions + vote on *

**Two items for the standby reader profile:**

**Item 1: Weight each profile dimension by significance (out of 10).**

Score each dimension from 1-10 for how important it is to getting the right standby reader:

- A. Education level (graduate-level humanities)
- B. No philosophy specialization
- C. No category theory / formal math
- D. No prior exposure to these essays or our materials
- E. Basic cultural literacy (Sisyphus, metaphysics, Laozi)
- F. Comfort with abstract ideas and sustained argument
- G. Tolerance for foreign terms and mathematical notation on page
- H. Curious and patient disposition
- I. Honest about confusion / not deferential
- J. **Experientially attentive** — notices what happens to them while reading
- K. Life experience (has worked a job, owned a pet, faced decisions)
- L. Reads literary fiction / attentive to prose quality

**Item 2: Vote on "Tell a friend what this is about" as a final prompt.**

The editor proposed asking the standby reader, after completing the full collection: "What would you tell a friend this collection is about?"

Vote: **YES** (keep this prompt) or **NO** (suggest a different/better final prompt).

Let me think carefully about the weighting. The standby reader's purpose is to test whether the translation preserves the experiential dimension of the philosophical experiments. Each dimension matters differently relative to that purpose.

Submitted both items. Here is a summary of my response:

**Dimension Weights** (ranked):
- **10/10**: D (no prior exposure) and J (experientially attentive) -- non-negotiable, the entire point of having a standby reader
- **9/10**: C (no math), H (curious/patient), I (honest about confusion) -- very high priority
- **8/10**: B (no philosophy specialization), F (comfort with abstraction) -- important thresholds
- **7/10**: A (education level), G (tolerance for foreign terms), K (life experience) -- helpful
- **6/10**: E (basic cultural literacy) -- moderate
- **5/10**: L (literary fiction reading) -- lowest priority; could even over-attend to prose at the expense of philosophical content

**Tell-a-friend vote**: YES, with the refinement of adding "Would you recommend it? Why or why not?" -- this separates comprehension from engagement, and the "why" forces experiential rather than analytical reporting.
