Do YOU think a philosophy of language expert would materially help the translation of the NON-category-theory essays (后形而上学, 诗意, 西西弗斯、班与猫, 集体利益, A Thought on Knowledge, 零散想法)?\n\n2. Or is the philosophy of language need mainly concentrated in the K1策略 essay (which we could handle later alongside the category theory expert)?\n\n3.

Would a philosophy of language expert materially help with the non-category-theory essays?**\n\nNo, not materially. The non-category-theory essays do not engage with philosophy of language as a discipline. They use language philosophically, but they do not theorize about language itself. Specific assessment:\n\n- \"后形而上学 整理\": The discussion of 道德仁义礼 involves naming, definition, and the reversal of explanatory direction (from phenomenon to concept), but this is a problem of constitution and abstraction, not of language per se. Phenomenology and Chinese philosophy cover this adequately.\n- \"形而上学后的目的：诗意\": The term 诗意 (the poetic) might seem to call for philosophy of language, but the author's use is not about poetic language -- it is about a mode of existential engagement. This is squarely phenomenological/existentialist territory.\n- \"西西弗斯、班与猫\": Pure existentialist/absurdist analysis. No language-philosophy dimension.\n- \"关于集体利益\": Uses the physics metaphor of renormalization. No language-philosophy dimension.\n- \"A Thought on Knowledge\": Epistemological analysis. The author does mention that phenomena must be \"digested\" into beliefs, which touches on the language/thought interface, but the treatment is epistemological, not linguistic.\n- \"零散想法\": The passage about memes and the \"你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国\" example does involve philosophy of language (meaning-in-context, pragmatics), but this passage appears only in the 零散想法 as a brief illustration of the K1 framework's implications. It is not an independent argument requiring dedicated expertise.\n\n**2. Is the philosophy of language need concentrated in K1策略?**\n\nYes, almost entirely. The K1 essay is where the author explicitly engages with:\n\n- Language games (语言游戏) as a method for investigating stable structures\n- The relationship between linguistic structure and meaning (\"是结构先于意义，还是意义先于结构\")\n- The claim that language \"forces\" knowledge structures into existence (\"语言本身的结构，如何逼迫知识结构的形成\")\n- The natural transformation account of understanding, illustrated with linguistic examples\n\nThe \"范畴论与境 整理\" essay's opening section on why category theory is appropriate (\"正如我们在语言的境界内，要界定一个词语的意思，我们不得不使用其他的语言\") also touches on philosophy of language, but this is a brief methodological remark, not a sustained argument.\n\nSo yes -- the philosophy of language need can be handled alongside the category theory expert when tackling K1策略 specifically.\n\n**3. What in my field's overlap with philosophy of language can I NOT adequately cover?**\n\nI can adequately cover:\n- The phenomenological dimension of meaning-constitution (Husserl's Bedeutungsintention and Bedeutungserfullung)\n- The relationship between the author's natural transformation account and phenomenological Verstehen\n- Merleau-Ponty's account of linguistic expression as creative rather than merely representational\n- The general connection between the author's framework and Heidegger's views on language as the \"house of Being\"\n\nWhat I **cannot** adequately cover:\n- The specific Wittgensteinian framework of language games that the author explicitly invokes. The author's claim that playing language games reveals stable structures (S_L) and that these map via functors to experiential stable structures (S_E) is a technical extension of Wittgenstein's therapeutic method into a constructive, structural program. Evaluating whether this extension is faithful to or a productive departure from Wittgenstein requires a Wittgenstein specialist. However, this is confined to K1策略.\n- The author's implicit engagement with speech act theory in the passage about how linguistic acts \"require us to provide justification relations, and so we begin to construct the knowledge structure itself\" (\"语言行为（如对话、辩护、叙事）要求我们给出论证关系，于是我们开始构造知识结构本身\"). This is close to Austin/Searle territory. Again, confined to K1策略.\n\n**Bottom line from phenomenology:** A philosophy of language expert is not needed for the non-K1 essays.
