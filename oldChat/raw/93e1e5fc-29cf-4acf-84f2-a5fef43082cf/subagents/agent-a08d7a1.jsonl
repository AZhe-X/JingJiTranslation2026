One item: my binding amendment on the Essay 3 probe wording does not appear to have been incorporated.\n\nLine 84 currently reads:\n> \"What happened to your experience across the three examples?\"\n\nMy amendment (which I submitted as my one required change in my APPROVE WITH AMENDMENT vote) was to remove the count \"three,\" since the essay actually has four stages: Sisyphus, office worker, entrepreneur (创业), cat owner. The entrepreneur is a structurally important pivot point where alienation is isolated as the variable. Saying \"three\" may cause the reader to mentally group the essay as three examples and skip reporting on the entrepreneur step.\n\nProposed wording:\n> \"What happened to your experience as you moved through the essay's examples?\"\n\nThis is a small change but it affects what data we get back. Could you update line 84?\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"0e41259f-287d-4d43-89fa-37db553de7e8","timestamp":"2026-02-11T09:22:44.032Z"}
