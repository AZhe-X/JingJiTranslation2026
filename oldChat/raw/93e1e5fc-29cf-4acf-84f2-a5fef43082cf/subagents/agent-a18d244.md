*梦境 contains 境 — should translation preserve this link?*

Question from the author: 梦境 contains the character 境 — the same 境 as in the title 境集 and the central concept 境 (Jing). But "dreamscape" (and most proposed translations) doesn't capture this connection. The reader of the English text would not see that 梦境 literally contains 境.

Brief responses welcome. This is a real translation problem.

Sent my analysis. The core recommendation: the translation of 梦境 must be visibly compositional with whatever translation is chosen for 境 itself, because the relationship between the two is not metaphorical but taxonomic -- 梦境 is a species of 境. Standing by.
