I loaded the Translator's Memo, Profile, and drafts (Preface, Essay4-DaoDeRenYiLi, Glossary-Introduction) to orient myself.\n\n---\n\n**1. Standby Reader Vote**\n- Received vote request from team-lead: should we add a standby reader?\n- Voted YES with reasoning: experiential sequences need naive testing; domain experts cannot provide this because we are too familiar with the source material.\n\n**2. Standby Reader Profile Proposal**\n- Received request from team-lead: propose a reader profile.\n- Submitted detailed proposal covering background (graduate-level humanities, not philosophy), what they should NOT know (Camus, category theory, Chinese philosophy, the existence of experiential sequences), what they SHOULD know (comfort with abstract prose, existential themes through lived experience, intellectual self-confidence), reading instructions (sequential, no explanation of why; report on what stayed, where lost, where shifted, what felt unnecessary; final question on whether Part 2 changes Part 1), and disposition (curious not skeptical, patient not infinitely so, reports felt experience not just propositional content, not a people-pleaser). Summary image: an LRB/NYRB reader.\n\n**3. Dimension Weighting**\n- Received request from team-lead: weight 12 profile dimensions 1-10.\n- My scores: D (no prior exposure) = 10, J (experientially attentive) = 10, C (no math) = 9, H (curious/patient) = 9, I (honest about confusion) = 9, B (no philosophy specialization) = 8, F (comfort with abstraction) = 8, A (education level) = 7, G (tolerance for foreign terms) = 7, K (life experience) = 7, E (basic cultural literacy) = 6, L (literary fiction reading) = 5.\n- Provided reasoning for each score.\n\n**4. \"Tell a Friend\" Prompt Vote**\n- Voted YES with refinement: add \"Would you recommend it? Why or why not?\" to separate comprehension from engagement.\n\n**5. \"What to Report\" Extraction Vote**\n- Received vote from team-lead: move \"What to Report\" to standalone file to avoid priming.\n- Voted YES. Reasoning: observer effect -- reporting questions (especially Essay 3 experiential checks) would prime the reader to watch for specific payloads, destroying the naive reading. Also proposed two-stage delivery: general prompts first, targeted checks only after general response is submitted.\n\n**6. Reporting Protocol Review -- Initial Feedback to Editor**\n- Read Reporting-Protocol.md and Standby Reader Profile.md.\n- Sent detailed feedback to editor with three categories:\n  - CONCERN: Line 31 (\"Did you feel like the essay was asking you to experience something?\") is leading. Proposed removal or one-time use after Essay 1.\n  - ENDORSEMENT: Critical Experiential Checks (lines 57-65) are well-designed. Proposed adding Essay 5 check.\n  - ESSAY-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS: Proposed Stage 2 follow-ups for each essay, delivered after general response. Detailed non-leading questions for Essays 1-7 and Appendix. Key principle: Essay 3 gets NO follow-up -- the cat must arrive unbidden.\n\n**7. Reporting Protocol Review -- Supplementary Feedback to Editor**\n- After re-reading all 8+1 source essays per team-lead instruction, sent supplementary feedback:\n  - Refined Essay 7 follow-up to distinguish math-incomprehension from meme-incomprehension\n  - New Essay 1 follow-up testing whether the reflexive ending twist landed\n  - Refined Essay 5 follow-up requesting personal example of \"the poetic\"\n  - Flagged Appendix's fragmentary quality and vulnerability of the near-lyrical climax\n  - Proposed Essay 5 Critical Experiential Check on impossibility of total disengagement\n\n**8. Unified Revision Plan Vote**\n- Received editor's 8-revision plan synthesizing all 10 submissions.\n- Voted APPROVE on Revisions 1-6, 8.\n- Voted APPROVE WITH AMENDMENT on Revision 7 (three amendments):\n  - 7a: Revise Essay 5 probe to orient toward felt experience of the two-dreamscapes distinction\n  - 7b: Add Essay 5 follow-up on impossibility of abandoning meaning (three neutral options)\n  - 7c: Revise Appendix probe to test whether climactic passage landed without naming it\n- Added second internal flag: watch Essay 7-to-Appendix transition.\n\n**9. Final Protocol Confirmation**\n- Received editor's notification that FINAL protocol was compiled and written (11/11 APPROVE).\n- Noted which of my amendments were incorporated and which were resolved differently.\n- Sent closing response to editor confirming all open items resolved, endorsing final protocol.\n\n**10. Editor's Earlier Assessment (received after final protocol)**\n- Received editor's detailed assessment of my initial feedback (cross-referenced with phenomenology-expert).\n- Confirmed line 31 resolved, Essay 5 Critical Check adequate, accepted no-essay-specific-questions decision, closed Essay 5 \"describe the poetic\" uncertainty.\n\n**11. Identity/Status Checks**\n- Three rounds of identity/status confirmation from team-lead.\n- Confirmed: existentialism-expert, all files loaded, idle since last check.\n\n---\n\n**Current state:** Idle, standing by.
