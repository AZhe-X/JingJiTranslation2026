The author (team lead) raises a concern:\n\nIf we set 经验 → \"experience\" as main, then both 经验 AND 体验 have \"experience\" as their main translation. The full mapping would be:\n\n- 感受 → \"feeling\" / \"felt experience\"\n- 体验 → \"experience\"\n- 经验 → \"experience\"\n- 感觉 → \"sensation\"\n\nTwo different Chinese terms with the same English main translation. Is this acceptable, or does it create a problem?\n\nIf you think it's fine, explain why. If you think it's a problem, what's your solution — should one of them change?\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"ba1b1591-4ec6-4d31-84d4-b3a80de26dbd","timestamp":"2026-02-11T04:36:25.438Z"}
