Would a philosophy of language expert materially help the NON-category-theory essays?\n\n**No, not materially.** The non-category-theory essays do not engage philosophy of language in a way that requires specialist expertise. Specifically:\n\n- **\"A Thought on Knowledge\"** uses language straightforwardly. The key moves (the access argument, the reduction of justification to belief, the three Bob examples) are epistemological arguments expressed in plain English. There is no Fregean sense/reference distinction at play, no speech act theory, no formal semantics. The closest thing to a philosophy-of-language issue is the author's observation that \"1+1=2\" functions as pure belief for most people because they cannot prove it -- but this is an epistemological point about justification, not a point about meaning or reference.\n\n- **\"后形而上学 整理\"** discusses how concepts are generated from phenomena through abstraction (归纳/抽象), and how the direction of generation gets inverted in metaphysical systems (the 道德仁义礼 example). This is about concept formation and metaphysical architecture, not about language per se. The author explicitly uses 现象礼/现象仁/现象义 as phenomenological descriptions, not as linguistic analyses.\n\n- **\"形而上学后的目的：诗意\"** introduces 梦境 (dreamscape) and 诗意 (the poetic). These are experiential/existential concepts, not linguistic ones. The distinction between \"沉醉的梦境\" (intoxicated dreamscape = faith/belief) and \"清醒的梦境\" (lucid dreamscape = the poetic) is about modes of engagement with meaning, not about how language constitutes meaning.\n\n- **\"西西弗斯、班与猫\"**, **\"集体利益\"**, and **\"零散想法\"** are essayistic and do not raise philosophy-of-language issues beyond what our team can handle.\n\n### 2. Is the philosophy of language need concentrated in K1策略?\n\n**Yes, almost entirely.** The substantive philosophy-of-language content is in K1策略, specifically:\n\n- The section on 知识的发生, where language games generate candidate beliefs via the functor $(F_{L \\to K})_t$. The claim that \"language is not just expressing already-known knowledge but is a knowledge-verification framework that even reverse-engineers the construction of knowledge structures\" (语言不是只是表达已知知识，而是一种知识验证框架，甚至反向促成了知识结构的构建) is a strong thesis about language's constitutive role in knowledge. This is Wittgensteinian territory.\n\n- The passage on whether structure precedes meaning or meaning precedes structure, resolved via natural transformations. This is the most technically philosophy-of-language moment in the entire collection.\n\n- The \"猫跳上了桌子\" example and the meme example (\"你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国\") illustrating comprehension as alignment between linguistic structure evolution and experiential evolution.\n\nAll of these are tightly interwoven with the category-theoretic formalism. A philosophy of language expert working on these passages without category theory expertise would be limited; a category theory expert working on them without philosophy of language would miss nuances. This reinforces my earlier recommendation: what we really need is **one expert who can handle both** (a mathematically literate philosopher of language, or a philosophically literate category theorist), rather than two separate additions.\n\n### 3. Is there anything in epistemology's overlap with philosophy of language that I CANNOT adequately cover?\n\nI can adequately cover:\n- The epistemological implications of the language-to-knowledge functor\n- The relationship between testimony (as a justification base) and linguistic transmission\n- The role of language games in generating candidate beliefs\n- The \"knowledge in motion\" discussion and how communal standards function linguistically\n\nWhat I am **less confident** about:\n- The precise Wittgensteinian lineage of the author's use of \"language games\" (语言游戏). The author invokes the term but does not cite Wittgenstein, and I am not certain whether the author's usage aligns with Wittgenstein's *Philosophical Investigations* sense (language games as forms of life, meaning as use) or is a more general/informal usage. A Wittgenstein specialist could clarify this and flag whether the translation should signal the connection or maintain distance from it.\n- The specific claim that linguistic structure \"forces\" (逼迫) knowledge structure formation. The word 逼迫 is strong -- it means \"compel/coerce.\" Whether this aligns with, say, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, linguistic determinism, or Brandom's inferentialism is a question where a philosophy of language expert would be more precise than I am.\n\n**However**, both of these are confined to K1策略 and could be addressed when that essay is translated alongside the category theory expert, as you suggest in your question. They do not affect the non-category-theory essays.\n\n**My bottom line**: Defer the philosophy of language question to the K1策略 translation phase.
