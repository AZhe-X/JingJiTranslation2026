*Confirming 诗意 resolution: *

The author endorses the current resolution for 诗意 (shiyi):

- **"the poetic"** as the standard substantive form
- **"poetic"** as adjective
- **"poeticality"** acceptable as an occasional variant noun
- **Capitalize "the Poetic"** in the translator's introduction and glossary to signal philosophical weight

Does everyone still agree with this resolution? Any second thoughts now that we've been through the full dictionary discussion? Concise yes/no + any brief additions.

The risk in English is that \"the poetic\" drifts toward \"the literary\" or \"the beautiful.\" The author's meaning is closer to \"the lucidly engaged\" -- knowing the structure is constructed yet fully investing in it. The capitalized \"the Poetic\" in the glossary introduction should make this technical meaning explicit so it anchors all subsequent lowercase uses.\n",

Still agree with the resolution. Added one caution: "the poetic" must read as a mode of cognitive engagement (lucid inhabitation of a constructed Jing), not as an aesthetic category. The glossary's capitalized "the Poetic" should anchor this technical meaning.
