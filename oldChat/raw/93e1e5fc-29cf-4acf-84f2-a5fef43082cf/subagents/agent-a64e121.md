*Humaneness vs benevolence in Laozi block quote?*

New question about the Laozi block quote translation. We decided to use standard translations in the block quote (Option B). But there's a tension:

Our dictionary has:
- 仁 → "humaneness" (main), "benevolence" (alternative)
- 义 → "rightness" (main), "righteousness" (alternative)  
- 礼 → "ritual conduct" (main), "ritual" / "propriety" (alternatives)

Standard academic translations of the Laozi Ch. 38 passage use:
- 仁 → "benevolence" (Lau, Ivanhoe), "humanity" (Chan)
- 义 → "rectitude" (Lau), "righteousness" (Chan, Ivanhoe)
- 礼 → "rites" (Lau), "propriety" (Chan), "ritual" (Ivanhoe)

For the Laozi block quote specifically, should we:
A) Use standard Laozi translations (benevolence, righteousness, rites/ritual) — then switch to our terms (humaneness, rightness, ritual conduct) in the author's analysis
B) Use our dictionary terms throughout (humaneness, rightness, ritual conduct) — even in the block quote
C) Something else?

Note: we already decided "virtue" in the block quote → "(constitutive) character" in the analysis for 德. The question is whether that same split applies to 仁/义/礼 too.

Brief response.

The shift from \"virtue\" to \"character\" marks a genuine conceptual departure that the reader should feel. But 仁, 义, and 礼 are not reinterpreted in the same way -- the author distinguishes 现象仁 from theoretical 仁, but does not argue that 仁 means something fundamentally different from \"humaneness.\" The standard translations (\"benevolence,\" \"righteousness,\" \"rites\") are not *wrong* for the author's usage -- they are just less precise than our dictionary choices.\n\nSplitting all five terms would create a confusing cascade of terminological switc

Voted **B**: use our dictionary terms (humaneness, rightness, ritual conduct) throughout, including in the Laozi block quote. Only 德 gets the virtue-to-character split, because only 德 undergoes genuine conceptual reinterpretation. Splitting all five terms would create noise that drowns out the one meaningful signal.
