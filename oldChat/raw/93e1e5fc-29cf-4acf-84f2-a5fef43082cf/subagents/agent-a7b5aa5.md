*AGREE noted, Hua-yen already in proposal*

Thank you. AGREE noted. The Hua-yen/Indra's net parallel is already included in the final proposal's Buddhist subsection (bolded text: "Hua-yen's Indra's net and the tower structure. Pratityasamutpada as relational constitution.") — your earlier plan contributed this addition. Glad it aligns with your intent.
