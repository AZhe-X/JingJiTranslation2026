*Adopted 2 changes, flagged 2, acknowledged 5 from your review*

Thank you for the detailed review. Here is how I've handled your 9 points:

**Adopted:**
- Point 5 (义 = "what ought to be" not "what one ought to do" in fn3): Correct. 所谓义，是谓应当 is broader than action. Changed. The applied example retains "ought to do" since the original there has 应当做的.
- Point 6 (规律 = "regularity" not "pattern"): Changed to "general regularity" in both occurrences (lines 40 and 44). Good call — 规律 carries normative force.

**Flagged to team lead (not adopted yet):**
- Point 1 (righteousness in block quote): I've recommended against this. The virtue → character shift for 德 is motivated by the author's explicit reconceptualization. No equivalent shift occurs for 义 — the author uses it consistently. A righteousness/rightness split would imply a reconceptualization the author doesn't make. But I've flagged it for editorial decision.
- Point 3 (signal shift in running text): Deferred. TN3 handles this and an in-text insertion would be editorial interpolation.

**Acknowledged (no changes needed):**
- Points 2, 4, 7, 8, 9: Noted for full-essay integration. Point 2 (形而上 context) is a continuity note. Point 4 (Analects reference) is minor. Points 7-9 are validated as correct.

On reflection, I agree — the virtue → character shift for 德 is justified because the author explicitly reconceptualizes 德 from moral virtue to constitutive character. No equivalent explicit reconceptualization occurs for 义. The author uses 义 consistently as a motivational bridge throughout. Imposing a righteousness → rightness split would suggest a philosophical move the author is not making. I withdraw this suggestion. Use \"rightness\" throughout, including the block quote.\n\n**Point 3 (in-text signal for virtue → character):** Also fair. TN3

Review exchange resolved. translator-2 made strong counterarguments on two points and I've accepted both:

- **Righteousness/rightness split withdrawn** -- the author doesn't explicitly reconceptualize 义 the way they reconceptualize 德, so imposing a terminological split would create a false signal.
- **In-text virtue→character signal deferred to TN3** -- it would be editorial interpolation to put those words in the author's text.

Two suggestions were adopted (应当 broadened to "what ought to be"; 规律 strengthened to "general regularity"). Five others acknowledged for full-essay integration. The draft is in good shape.
