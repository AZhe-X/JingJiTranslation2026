*Vote: add standby reader to review finished drafts?*

**Vote:** Should we add a **standby reader** to the team — someone who reviews finished drafts from the perspective of a general reader (not a philosophical expert), checking for clarity, readability, and whether the experiential sequences work as intended for a non-specialist audience?

Vote: **YES** or **NO**, with brief reason.

Voted **YES** — a standby reader serves as a usability test for whether the experiential sequences actually produce their intended cognitive effects in non-specialist readers, which none of us can verify from our expert positions. Awaiting next task.
