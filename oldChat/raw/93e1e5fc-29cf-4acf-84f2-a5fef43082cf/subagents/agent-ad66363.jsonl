In Yogacara, the *alambanapratyaya* (所缘缘) is the object-condition upon which consciousness depends. 境 in this usage means \"what consciousness takes as its object.\"\n    23→- **Gocara** (range, domain of activity): the field within which a being operates. A bodhisattva's *gocara* is the range of beings and dharmas they engage with.\n    24→- **Ayatana** (sense-base): the twelve bases (六入/十二處) that structure perception -- six internal (sense faculties) and six external (sense objects). 境 here is part of the perceptual apparatus itself, not something beyond it.\n    25→\n    26→**The Author's Usage.** The author defines E (境) as a *structure on P (phenomena)*: \"E is a structure on P; we *choose* to describe this structure categorically.\" Specifically, E consists of selected portions of phenomenal experience as objects, with associations (联想) between them as morphisms. This is strikingly close to the Yogacara notion of 境 as visaya -- the object-domain of consciousness -- but with a critical structural enrichment. Where Yogacara identifies the *vijnapti* (表/了别) as the fundamental unit of consciousness-taking-an-object, the author formalizes the *relations between* such object-takings as the essential content of 境.\n    27→\n    28→**Transformation, Not Departure.** The author *preserves* the core Buddhist insight that 境 is not \"the world out there\" but the domain as it appears to and is structured by mind. The author's insistence that P (phenomena) is the 第一实在 and that any \"objective world\" is a model *generated from* phenomena is almost precisely the Yogacara position that 境 is *vijnapti-matra* (唯識所現) -- appearance-only. However, the author *transforms* the Buddhist usage in two important ways:\n    29→\n    30→1. **Formalization through category theory.** Buddhist 境 is typically described phenomenologically or meditatively. The author's move to describe 境 as a category with tower structure (塔式結構) is unprecedented in Buddhist thought. The tower structure -- where morphisms are themselves objects at higher meta-orders -- has a rough analog in Yogacara's stratification of consciousness (eight consciousnesses, the *manas* taking *alayavijnana* as its object), but the formal precision is entirely new.\n    31→\n    32→2. **Dynamic evolution.** The evolution functor T mapping E_t to E_{t+1} captures something that Buddhist thought addresses through the concept of *santana* (相續) -- the continuum of mind-moments. But the author's framework makes the *structural invariance across evolution* (the stable structure S_E) a primary object of study, which is closer to what Dharmakirti (法稱) attempted in his epistemology than to mainstream Yogacara.\n    33→\n    34→**Translation Implication.** 境 in this collection should NOT be translated simply as \"realm\" or \"domain\" (which lose the Buddhist resonance) nor as \"visaya\" (which would over-identify with one tradition). The author's 境 is simultaneously the experiential field (close to visaya/gocara), the structure imposed on that field (close to Yogacara's vijnapti-structuring), and the bounded arena of meaning-making (close to the colloquial Chinese 境界 as \"level of attainment/understanding\"). \"Experiential Scape\" or the proposed \"E\" may be best, with a translator's note explaining the Buddhist resonances. The rendering \"Scape\" (from landscape/dreamscape) preserves the phenomenological, structured, and bounded dimensions.\n    35→\n    36→---\n    37→\n    38→## 2. Sunyata and 虚無: The Void After Metaphysics vs. Emptiness\n    39→\n    40→This is perhaps the most important point of comparison, and the author's position is more sophisticated than a first glance might suggest.\n    41→\n    42→**The Author's Position.** In 后形而上学 整理, the author states: \"Nihilism is not a being, not a doctrine (主义), but an absence, a vacancy (缺位). Nihilism is not produced or created, just as the void is not produced or created -- it is simply that nothing is being produced or created anymore, and there is nothing here.\" This is a negative characterization: nihilism is the *aftermath* of metaphysics' collapse, not a positive assertion.\n    43→\n    44→**Madhyamaka's Sunyata.** Nagarjuna's emptiness (sunyata) is emphatically *not* nihilism (uccheda-vada, 断見). The Mulamadhyamakakarika 24.18 states: \"Whatever is dependently originated, that we call emptiness. That is a dependent designation; it is itself the middle way.\" Candrakirti's Prasannapada makes clear that sunyata is not the absence of entities but the absence of *svabhava* (self-nature/inherent existence) in entities. The crucial distinction: Madhyamaka emptiness is a *characterization of how things exist* (dependently), not a statement that nothing exists.\n    45→\n    46→**Comparison.** The author's nihilism-as-void is structurally analogous to what Madhyamaka calls *falling into the extreme of nihilism* (堕入斷邊) -- which is precisely what Nagarjuna warns against. However, the author does NOT stay in this void. The move to *post-metaphysics* (後形而上學) parallels the Middle Way in a striking manner:\n    47→\n    48→- **Eternalism** (常見, sassata-ditthi): the pre-metaphysical position where 第〇実在 (zeroth reality / ultimate reality) is treated as actually existent and foundational. This corresponds to *nitya-vada* -- the view that there are permanent essences.\n    49→- **Nihilism** (斷見, uccheda-vada): the void left after metaphysics collapses. Nothing has meaning, no foundation exists.\n    50→- **Post-metaphysics** (後形而上學): the author's proposed middle path -- acknowledging that all 形而上 (metaphysical structures) are constructions upon phenomena, while recognizing that these constructions are real *as constructions*, functional, and necessary for lived experience.\n    51→\n    52→This tripartite movement (pre-metaphysics -> nihilism -> post-metaphysics) precisely mirrors the Madhyamaka progression: naive realism -> nihilistic misunderstanding of emptiness -> correct understanding of emptiness as the middle way. The author's insight that \"post-metaphysics must constantly recognize that any 形而上 is merely a description and model of 形 (phenomena)\" is remarkably close to Candrakirti's insistence that conventional designations are valid *precisely because* they lack inherent existence.\n    53→\n    54→**Critical Difference.** The author grounds the exit from nihilism in *non-rationality* (非理性) -- the acknowledgment that our pursuit of constancy and meaning is not rationally justified but is an irreducible feature of human existence that must be *recognized* (承認). Madhyamaka, by contrast, exits the nihilistic extreme through the *logical* demonstration that emptiness and dependent origination are co-extensive. The author's path is more existential-phenomenological; Nagarjuna's is more logical-dialectical. But both arrive at a strikingly similar place: a middle ground where constructions are neither ultimately real nor meaningless.\n    55→\n    56→---\n    57→\n    58→## 3. 清醒的梦境 (Lucid Dreamscape) and Buddhist Awakening\n    59→\n    60→This is where the Buddhist resonances become most explicit and most interesting.\n    61→\n    62→**The Author's Framework.** In 形而上学後的目的：詩意, the author distinguishes:\n    63→- **沉醉的梦境** (intoxicated dreamscape): engagement with meaning-structures without awareness that they are constructions. This is faith/belief (信念/信仰). Purpose appears as logically groundless but historically conditioned -- the unmoved mover, the ultimate reality.\n    64→- **清醒的梦境** (lucid dreamscape): engagement with meaning-structures *while knowing* they are constructions. This is *poeticality* (詩意). One plays the game knowing it is a game, reads the novel knowing it is a novel, burns incense paper knowing the dead do not literally receive it.\n    65→\n    66→**Chan/Zen Awakening (悟/覺).** The parallel to Chan awakening is profound but not exact:\n    67→\n    68→- **Chan awakening** (悟, wu; Japanese satori) typically involves a sudden recognition that conceptual constructions (including \"enlightenment\" and \"delusion\") are empty of self-nature. The famous Chan saying: \"Before enlightenment, mountains are mountains. During practice, mountains are not mountains. After enlightenment, mountains are mountains again\" (青原惟信) describes precisely the trajectory: naive engagement -> recognition of constructedness -> return to engagement with transformed understanding.\n    69→\n    70→- The author's 清醒的梦境 corresponds most closely to the *third stage* -- mountains are mountains again, but now one *knows* they are not inherently mountains. The engagement is full (全身心之投入), but the engagement is *lucid* (清醒).\n    71→\n    72→**The Diamond Sutra's Dream Metaphor.** The Diamond Sutra (金剛經) concludes: \"All conditioned phenomena are like a dream, an illusion, a bubble, a shadow; like dew or lightning -- thus should you contemplate them\" (一切有為法，如夢幻泡影，如露亦如電，應作如是觀). This is NOT a call to disengage. Crucially, the sutra says *contemplate them thus* while continuing to practice the perfections (paramita). The bodhisattva saves all beings while knowing there are no beings to save (Vajracchedika 3). This is precisely the author's 清醒 -- knowing the dreamscape is a dreamscape, yet fully engaging within it.\n    73→\n    74→**Madhyamaka's Dream Analogy.** In Madhyamaka, the dream analogy (svapna-drstanta) appears in Nagarjuna's Vigrahavyavartani and extensively in Santideva's Bodhicaryavatara (9th chapter). The key point: dream objects *function* within the dream even though they lack inherent existence. A dream fire can warm a dream body. Similarly, conventional practices (language, ethics, meditation) *function* conventionally even though they are empty of inherent existence. The author's claim that 清醒 \"does not mean we are indifferent to its purpose, without investment in the dreamscape\" and that \"lucid dreamscape still necessarily means full engagement\" captures this Madhyamaka point with remarkable precision.\n    75→\n    76→**Critical Addition.** The author adds something that Buddhist texts typically do not make explicit in quite this way: \"We *must* embrace some dreamscapes, because I as an *already-existing I* necessarily have feelings that belong to *me*, and feelings exist prior to the concept of *I*.\" This phenomenological priority of feeling over selfhood resonates with the Buddhist teaching that vedana (feeling/受) is one of the five aggregates and arises through contact (phassa/觸) prior to any reified self. But the author draws from this an almost Heideggerian conclusion about thrownness -- we are already in dreamscapes before we can choose to exit them. This is less emphasized in Buddhist soteriology, which tends to present the path as a progressive disengagement from attachment even while recognizing the inescapability of conditioned existence.\n    77→\n    78→**Translation Note.** 清醒的梦境 should probably be rendered as \"lucid dreamscape\" rather than \"wakeful dream\" or \"conscious illusion.\" The term 清醒 carries connotations of 覺 (awareness, awakening) in Chinese Buddhist usage, and this resonance should be preserved. 沉醉 (intoxication) recalls the Buddhist concept of *mada* (madness/intoxication), one of the klesha (煩惱/afflictions).\n    79→\n    80→---\n    81→\n    82→## 4. Two Truths and Layered Reality\n    83→\n    84→**The Author's Framework:**\n    85→- **第一実在** (First Reality): phenomena as directly encountered. Cannot be doubted because doubting it leaves no ground to stand on. This is the starting point.\n    86→- **第二実在** (Second Reality): our interpretations, models, concepts built upon phenomena. The \"objective world\" as we understand it. All metaphysical constructions.\n    87→- **第〇実在** (Zeroth Reality): the putative \"ultimate reality\" behind phenomena. The author's crucial claim: \"When we propose 第〇実在, the very thing we propose *becomes* 第二実在.\" Any attempt to articulate the ultimate makes it a construction.\n    88→\n    89→**The Buddhist Two Truths:**\n    90→- **Samvrti-satya** (世俗諦, conventional truth): the level of ordinary language, concepts, and practical engagement. Things exist conventionally.\n    91→- **Paramartha-satya** (勝義諦, ultimate truth): emptiness -- the absence of inherent existence in all phenomena.\n    92→\n    93→**Comparison.** The mapping is not one-to-one but illuminating:\n    94→\n    95→| Author's Framework | Buddhist Two Truths | Key Difference |\n    96→|---|---|---|\n    97→| 第一実在 (phenomena) | Neither -- phenomena are the *basis* for both truths | Buddhism does not privilege raw phenomena as a distinct level |\n    98→| 第二実在 (construction) | Samvrti-satya (conventional truth) | Close correspondence |\n    99→| 第〇実在 (inaccessible ultimate) | Paramartha-satya (ultimate truth) | Divergence: see below |\n   100→\n   101→The critical divergence: In Madhyamaka, *paramartha-satya is not inaccessible*. It is realized through prajna (wisdom) and is the direct content of arya-jnana (noble wisdom). Nagarjuna explicitly states that nirvana and samsara are not different (MMK 25.19-20). The ultimate truth is not \"behind\" or \"below\" the conventional -- it IS the emptiness of the conventional. You access it not by going somewhere else but by seeing *this* differently.\n   102→\n   103→The author's 第〇実在, by contrast, is defined as *in principle inaccessible*: \"When we propose 第〇実在, the proposed thing becomes 第二実在.\" This is closer to Kant's noumenon than to Madhyamaka's paramartha. However, the author's *reason* for this inaccessibility -- that any articulation is already a construction -- resonates with the Madhyamaka teaching that ultimate truth cannot be captured by *prapanca* (conceptual proliferation/戲論). Nagarjuna's statement that the Buddha's teaching is \"the cessation of all views\" (sarvadrstiprahana) and that the Dharma is \"beyond the scope of thought\" (acintya) suggests a similar inaccessibility *at the conceptual level*, even though realization is possible through non-conceptual wisdom.\n   104→\n   105→**Yogacara Parallel.** The three-level structure actually maps more naturally onto Yogacara's *trisvabhava* (三性/三自性):\n   106→- **Parikalpita-svabhava** (遍計所執性, thoroughly imagined nature): what we project onto phenomena -- corresponds to those aspects of 第二実在 that are pure construction with no phenomenal basis.\n   107→- **Paratantra-svabhava** (依他起性, other-dependent nature): the dependently arisen flow of experience -- corresponds closely to 第一実在 as phenomena.\n   108→- **Parinispanna-svabhava** (圓成實性, fully accomplished nature): the absence of the imagined in the dependent -- corresponds to what the author calls 第〇実在, except that in Yogacara this IS accessible through transformed consciousness (转识成智).\n   109→\n   110→---\n   111→\n   112→## 5. Dependent Origination and Structural Relations (Pratityasamutpada)\n   113→\n   114→This is perhaps the deepest philosophical convergence in the entire collection.\n   115→\n   116→**The Author's Core Move.** In 范畴论与境 整理, the author states: \"Rather than exploring 'the essence of things' as an *inward* direction, a more practical orientation is to explore 'the position of things' as an *outward* (relational) direction... In practice, the exploration of internal essence is 'impossible' because any exploration of *internal* essence will ultimately convert into an exploration of its *external* extensions.\"\n   117→\n   118→This is then formalized: objects in category E are defined by their morphisms (relationships to other objects). A concept like \"pen\" (笔) is defined as the universal property in a subcategory -- it is the terminal object toward which all concrete pens have morphisms. The \"essence\" of pen is not some internal pen-ness but the structural position that \"pen\" occupies in the web of associations.\n   119→\n   120→**Buddhist Pratityasamutpada.** The doctrine of dependent origination (緣起, pratityasamutpada) asserts that all dharmas arise in dependence on conditions (pratyaya) and have no self-nature (svabhava, 自性). Nagarjuna's MMK 24.18: \"Whatever is dependently arisen, that we call emptiness.\" The rejection of svabhava means precisely that things do not have \"internal essences\" -- they are constituted by their relations.\n   121→\n   122→**The Convergence is Structural.** The author's category-theoretic framework, where objects are defined by morphisms (external relations), is a *formal expression* of the Buddhist rejection of svabhava. In category theory, two objects are \"the same\" (isomorphic) if and only if they have the same morphisms to and from all other objects -- their \"internal\" content is irrelevant. This is essentially the *Yoneda lemma*, which the author implicitly invokes. The Buddhist equivalent: a dharma is constituted entirely by its conditions and relations, not by any inherent nature.\n   123→\n   124→**Hua-yen (華嚴) Resonance.** The author's tower structure -- where morphisms are themselves objects with their own morphisms -- resonates powerfully with the Hua-yen (Avatamsaka) doctrine of *shishi wuai* (事事無礙, non-obstruction of phenomena with phenomena). In Fa-zang's (法藏) metaphor of Indra's net, each jewel reflects all other jewels, and each reflection contains further reflections -- a structure that is precisely tower-like. The category-theoretic formalization of this mutual interpenetration is arguably what the author achieves with the tower construction.\n   125→\n   126→---\n   127→\n   128→## 6. The Self (我) and Buddhist Anatman\n   129→\n   130→**The Author's Definition.** In the section on objectification: \"'I' is that feeling, the feeling that whenever you mention any aspect related to me, it causes me to associate -- that feeling is me.\" Formally, \"I\" is the universal property (terminal object) of a subcategory of E whose objects are all experiences related to me.\n   131→\n   132→**Buddhist Anatman.** The Buddha's teaching of anatman (無我, anatta) denies a permanent, unchanging, independent self. The Milindapanha's chariot analogy: just as a \"chariot\" is a designation for an assemblage of parts (wheels, axle, frame...) with no chariot-essence beyond the parts, so \"self\" is a designation for the five aggregates (skandha/蘊) with no self-essence beyond them.\n   133→\n   134→**Remarkable Convergence.** The author's definition of self as a universal property -- a structural position in a network of associations, not a substance -- is *precisely* the Middle Way position on self. It is neither:\n   135→- Eternalism: there IS a \"feeling of I,\" it IS something experienceable, it is not nothing.\n   136→- Nihilism: there is no self-substance, no atman; \"I\" is just the terminal object in a subcategory, constituted by its relations.\n   137→\n   138→The author even notes: \"When we strip away our characteristics (if I can no longer play piano, am I still me?), we eventually arrive at 'emptiness' -- but this is because we chose the wrong structure (containment relations on physical objects). When we choose phenomena as P, 'I' is that feeling, that experience.\" This parallels the Buddhist analysis beautifully: the self cannot be found among the aggregates (as Nagarjuna demonstrates in MMK 18), but it *functions* as a conventional designation based on the aggregates.\n   139→\n   140→**Yogacara Addition.** The Yogacara notion of *manas* (末那識) -- the seventh consciousness that perpetually grasps the *alayavijnana* as \"self\" -- provides a mechanism for *why* the terminal object \"I\" forms. The author's framework could incorporate this: the formation of \"I\" as universal property may be linked to a stable structure S_E that functions like the manas -- a persistent structural tendency to organize experience around a self-pole.\n   141→\n   142→---\n   143→\n   144→## 7. 恒常 (Constancy) and Anitya (Impermanence)\n   145→\n   146→**The Author's Analysis.** In 后形而上学 整理: \"The core of metaphysics is *constancy* (恒常). We need to find (pursue) a constancy within changing phenomena, so that we can intentionally perform any action with results meaningful to us.\" Constancy is a \"guarantee\" (保證) -- the same phenomena will *repeat*. The entire edifice of metaphysics, from recognizing \"this apple\" as the same apple across moments to abstract concepts like \"honesty,\" is driven by this pursuit of constancy.\n   147→\n   148→**Buddhist Anitya.** The first of the three marks of existence (trilaksana): all conditioned phenomena are impermanent (anicca/無常). The *Satipatthana Sutta* instructs practitioners to observe arising and passing (samudaya-vaya-dhamma) in all phenomena. The pursuit of permanence (nitya/常) is identified as a fundamental cognitive error (*viparyasa*/顛倒) -- we impute permanence where there is change.\n   149→\n   150→**The Comparison.** The author's analysis of 恒常 as the *driving force* of metaphysics parallels the Buddhist diagnosis with extraordinary precision. The Buddhist teaching identifies four cognitive inversions (*viparyasa*):\n   151→1. Taking the impermanent as permanent (於無常執常)\n   152→2. Taking suffering as happiness\n   153→3. Taking the non-self as self\n   154→4. Taking the impure as pure\n   155→\n   156→The author's 恒常 corresponds to the first inversion. The author's analysis of how identity (同一) is constructed -- \"this apple at this moment and the next moment is the *same* thing\" -- is precisely what Buddhist philosophers like Dharmakirti analyzed as *santana-pratyabhijna* (相續上的再認識), the (mis)recognition of continuity in a stream of momentary dharmas.\n   157→\n   158→**Key Difference.** Buddhism identifies the pursuit of permanence as rooted in *avidya* (ignorance/無明) and to be *overcome* through insight. The author, by contrast, does not prescribe overcoming it but rather *recognizing* (承認) it as an irreducible non-rational feature of human cognition, and then *working with it* lucidly (poetically). This is a genuinely different soteriological orientation -- one might say the author proposes \"post-metaphysical constancy-seeking\" rather than \"cessation of constancy-seeking.\"\n   159→\n   160→---\n   161→\n   162→## 8. Translation Challenges\n   163→\n   164→### Key Terms with Buddhist Resonance\n   165→\n   166→**境 (E/Scape).** As discussed in section 1, this term carries the full weight of Buddhist visaya/gocara/ayatana. A single English word cannot capture all dimensions. I recommend:\n   167→- Primary translation: keep as \"E\" in technical passages (as the author does), with \"Scape\" or \"Experiential Scape\" in discursive passages.\n   168→- Translator's note explaining the Buddhist genealogy of the term and why \"realm,\" \"sphere,\" \"domain\" are insufficient.\n   169→- Avoid \"world\" (too ontologically loaded) and \"field\" (too Bourdieu-specific in English philosophy).\n   170→\n   171→**境界.** When the author uses 境界 in a phrase like \"语言的境界\" (the boundary/domain of language), this should be \"bounds\" or \"horizon\" -- capturing both \"domain\" and \"limit.\" The Buddhist resonance of 境界 as both \"experiential domain\" and \"level of attainment\" is important here.\n   172→\n   173→**虚無/虚無主義.** The author explicitly distinguishes 虚無 (nihilism-as-void) from any positive doctrine. This should be \"nihilism\" but with a translator's note distinguishing it from Buddhist 空 (sunyata/emptiness). The author's 虚無 is *not* sunyata. The Kumarajiva translation tradition rendered sunyata as 空 precisely to avoid confusion with 無 (non-being). The author follows this distinction implicitly.\n   174→\n   175→**清醒/覺.** 清醒 (lucid/awakened) carries overtones of 覺 (bodhi, awakening). \"Lucid\" is the best English term -- it preserves both \"clear-seeing\" and the dreamscape context (as in \"lucid dreaming\"). Avoid \"awakened\" (too specifically Buddhist) and \"conscious\" (too Cartesian).\n   176→\n   177→**梦境.** \"Dreamscape\" is preferable to \"dream\" (too narrow) or \"illusion\" (too negative). The author explicitly says the 梦境 is NOT an illusion to be dispelled but a space of meaning to be engaged with lucidly.\n   178→\n   179→**恒常.** \"Constancy\" is better than \"permanence\" (which sounds more like Buddhist 常/nitya as a metaphysical claim). The author's 恒常 is about the *pursuit* of repeatability and stability, not a metaphysical assertion of permanence.\n   180→\n   181→**現象.** \"Phenomena\" is appropriate but should carry a note distinguishing the author's usage from Husserlian phenomenology (though there are resonances) and from the Buddhist technical usage of 法 (dharma). The author's \"phenomena\" is closer to what the Pali tradition calls *paccakkha* (directly experienced) -- what is given prior to interpretation.\n   182→\n   183→**形而上.** A significant challenge. The author distinguishes 形而上 (the metaphysical, as a category of content) from 形而上學 (metaphysics, the study thereof). In English, both are typically rendered \"metaphysics.\" I recommend \"the metaphysical\" for 形而上 and \"metaphysics\" for 形而上學, with a note explaining that 形而上 literally means \"above form\" and in the author's usage refers to any interpretive structure built upon phenomena.\n   184→\n   185→**第〇実在, 第一実在, 第二実在.** \"Zeroth Reality,\" \"First Reality,\" \"Second Reality\" preserve the numbering. Important: the numbering is epistemic-structural, not ontological. A note should clarify that these do not correspond to degrees of \"realness\" in the Buddhist sense but to degrees of accessibility and constructedness.\n   186→\n   187→### Sanskrit -> Chinese -> English Chain\n   188→\n   189→The Buddhist translation tradition (especially Kumarajiva and Xuanzang) established Chinese philosophical vocabulary that the author inherits and transforms. Key translation chain considerations:\n   190→\n   191→- **Svabhava -> 自性 -> self-nature/inherent existence**: The author's rejection of \"internal essences\" in favor of relational definition recapitulates this Buddhist trajectory without using the term 自性.\n   192→- **Pratityasamutpada -> 緣起 -> dependent origination**: The relational/structural approach is *functionally* equivalent to dependent origination but formalized categorically.\n   193→- **Prapanca -> 戲論 -> conceptual proliferation**: The author's description of metaphysical construction building upon construction (tower structure) could be described as a *formalization of prapanca*.\n   194→\n   195→---\n   196→\n   197→## 9. Overall Significance\n   198→\n   199→**Is this a genuinely novel synthesis?** Yes, with qualifications.\n   200→\n   201→### What is Genuinely Novel\n   202→\n   203→1. **Categorical formalization of Buddhist-adjacent insights.** Buddhist philosophy has long operated with insights about relational constitution (pratityasamutpada), the constructedness of selfhood (anatman), and the structure of experiential domains (境界). The author provides a *formal mathematical language* (category theory) that captures these insights with a precision unavailable to traditional Buddhist discourse. The tower structure, universal properties as metaphysical concepts, evolution functors, natural transformations -- these are genuine formal innovations applied to perennial philosophical concerns.\n   204→\n   205→2. **The stable structure S_E as a bridge between transcendental and empirical.** The author's conjecture that there exist stable structures preserved across the evolution of E -- and that these can be *empirically investigated* through \"philosophical experiments\" -- represents a genuinely new methodological proposal. Buddhist traditions have their own empirical methods (meditation, contemplative practice), but the author's proposal to use designed experiential stimuli (literature, art, memes, games) to test for structural invariants in experience is novel.\n   206→\n   207→3. **Post-metaphysical poeticality as a stance.** While the author's 清醒的梦境 (lucid dreamscape) parallels Chan awakening and the Madhyamaka middle way, the explicit articulation of this stance as *poeticality* (詩意) -- and the insistence that this is neither faith nor nihilism but a third way of relating to meaning-structures -- is a genuinely original contribution. Buddhism tends to articulate the post-awakening stance in terms of *karuna* (compassion) and *upaya* (skillful means); the author articulates it in terms of lucid creative engagement with constructed meaning.\n   208→\n   209→4. **The natural transformation as \"understanding.\"** The formal characterization of \"I understand X\" as the existence of a natural transformation between the evolution of X's structure and the evolution of one's experiential structure (section on K1 strategy) is, to my knowledge, unprecedented and philosophically fertile.\n   210→\n   211→### What Buddhist Philosophy Has Achieved Through Different Means\n   212→\n   213→1. **The soteriological dimension.** Buddhist philosophy is fundamentally oriented toward *dukkha-nirodha* (cessation of suffering). The author's framework is *descriptive* and explicitly avoids value judgments about whether one *should* pursue certain structures or experiences. Buddhism provides a complete praxis -- ethics (sila), meditation (samadhi), wisdom (prajna) -- for transforming the experiential domain. The author gestures toward \"philosophical experiments\" but has not (yet) developed a comparable praxis.\n   214→\n   215→2. **The intersubjective dimension.** Buddhist sangha (community) practice, teacher-student transmission, and the vast commentarial tradition address how 境 is *shared, transmitted, and collectively refined* across persons and generations. The author's framework is largely focused on individual experience, though the K1 strategy's discussion of cross-domain functors and the \"philosophical experiment\" methodology opens this door.\n   216→\n   217→3. **The contemplative verification.** Buddhist traditions have developed extraordinarily refined methods for investigating the structure of experience through first-person contemplative practice -- vipassana, shikantaza, hua-tou investigation. The author's \"introspection\" (内省) as a method for verifying categorical structures is suggestive but underdeveloped compared to these traditions.\n   218→\n   219→### Final Assessment\n   220→\n   221→This framework achieves something genuinely significant: it provides a *formal bridge* between the structural insights of Buddhist philosophy and the mathematical tools of contemporary thought, while grounding everything in phenomenological experience. It is not a *translation* of Buddhism into category theory, nor a *reduction* of category theory to Buddhist categories. It is an independent philosophical framework that arrives at many of the same structural insights as Buddhist philosophy through a different route, and then adds formal tools that Buddhist philosophy lacks. The Buddhist tradition, in turn, offers the author's framework a vast treasury of experiential data, contemplative methods, and soteriological orientation that could enrich and ground future development.\n   222→\n   223→The Hua-yen metaphor of Indra's net -- infinite mutual reflection -- may be the single best Buddhist image for what the author's tower structure formalizes. And the Chan saying \"直指人心，見性成佛\" (point directly at the human mind, see nature and become Buddha) may be the Buddhist equivalent of the author's \"philosophical experiment\" -- the construction of a specific experiential structure to trigger direct experiential verification.\n   224→\n   225→This is serious philosophy that deserves serious engagement from both Buddhist scholars and philosophers of mathematics.\n   226→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

其一]]》草稿的整理，删去了一些相关性较弱和未完成的部分。在这一篇文章里，作者用自己的语言大概记录和梳理其高中时期对传统的形而上学的一些看法。许多名词和概念和哲学传统有差别，需要读者注意甄别以免混淆。\n     8→\n     9→\n    10→## 前形而上学\n    11→\n    12→*前形而上学*[^1]，或者我也把它叫做传统形而上学，经典形而上学，是我创造出来的一个名词。所谓前，指的是相对于虚无主义而言的前，即在虚无主义之前的形而上学。\n    13→\n    14→我们将我们在当前所“拥有”的一切叫做*现象*。而在*现象*上，我们推断出一系列*现象*的运行方式/规律。我们似乎认为，所谓“现象的运行方式/规律”，既是前形而上学[^2]。\n    15→\n    16→前形而上学有一个**形式上的**错误理解，既是对“*上*”的理解。形而上学的英文，“*metaphysics*”，字面上来看，既是*元物理*。倘若把物理理解为*现象*，那么形而上学所描述的，既是产生现象的原因。然而事实上，请看上一段对形而上学的解释，形而上学事实上是**自现象而产生的**。所谓“上”，应当是我们**基于现象之上**而有的一套理解，而非自上而下由形而上**生成**了形。因此，*现象*，亦或者说我们所感受到的世界，对于我们而言，并非*生成的世界*，而是对于我们而言的“*第一实在*”[^25]。我们任何的对于现象的理解，都**基于**现象。唯有承认现象既是“*第一实在*”，我们才能够作出任何形而上的推断。\n    17→\n    18→请看如下例子：\n    19→\n    20→> 故失*道*而后*德*，失*德*而后*仁*，失*仁*而后*义*，失*义*而后*礼*。——老子\n    21→\n    22→其中，*道*，*德*，*仁*，*义*，*礼*，自前往后，既是从上至下。*道*生万物，*道*既是最“元始”的*元物理*（*metaphysics*），而有此往后，皆是*生成*的。因此，道既是最上者，是为形而上，而礼既是最下者，是为形。\n    23→\n    24→然而，礼事实上是从现象所总结出来的，我们不妨将这个**切实**的*现象*中的行为称之为“*现象礼*”，我对“*现象礼*”有一个**解释**，既是我对人时发乎于心的对他人感受，这个感受是我个人**切实**感受到的，因而是*现象*的一部分，因此我将其称之为“*现象仁*”。这个感受使得我想要去如何如何地对待他人，这种推动力（motivation）也是我所**切实**感受到的，因此我将其称之为“*现象义*”[^3]。“*现象礼*”不仅仅存在于在我对待他人时，也同样存在于其他人是如何对待他人上，我们便将“*现象仁*”和“*现象义*”作为我们对“*现象礼*”的**解释**推而广之。也就是说，因为“*现象礼*”（似乎）在我们周围的所有人身上都有体现，而我们认为（将“*现象礼*”解释为）“*现象仁*”产生了“*现象义*”又产生了”*现象礼*”，所以我们认为所有（行“现象礼”的）人都（应当）有这种“*现象仁*”[^4]。接下来，我们便把我们认为（应当是）人人皆而有之的东西，在这里便是“*现象仁*”，称之为“*德*”，而为什么会有这种人人皆而有之的**规律**呢？因为“*道*”[^24]。\n    25→\n    26→因此我们看到，在现象的层面上，*仁义*仅仅是对于*礼*的一个解释。对于我们看到的外在的*现象*而言，事实上我们仅仅看到了*现象*中的“*现象礼*”，因而我们**推断**出了“*现象义*”，续而由“*现象义*”**推断**出了“*现象仁*”，即便并**没有**任何**切实**的“*现象义*”和“*现象仁*”出现在我的*现象*中，因为**我**所感受到的发乎于心的感受和推动力仅仅是**我**在行“*现象礼*”时所感受到的，而我无法真正感受到**他人**的内心感受，仅仅是将我对“**自己**的‘*现象礼*’”的解释**套用**到了我们看到的**别人**所行的“*现象礼*”上。因此，别人身上的*仁义*，其实是由*现象*中的“*现象礼*”所生成的。但是我们在解释上却认为是由*仁*而生*义*，因*义*而行*礼*，“*现象礼*”反而是由*仁义*所生成的了。接下来，基于这种生成的*仁义*，我们便总结出来，“人都是有*仁*的”。但是，事实上是“人都是（**可以**）有*仁*的”，因为我们是从诸多有*仁*的人身上发现许多人都是有*仁*的，因此*仁*是我们归纳出来的一个**属性**（**property**）。但是我们最终对其的理解是“人都是（**应该**）有*仁*的”——或者说，“有*仁*的才是人”。因此人可以拥有的一个**属性**，在这里既是“*仁*”，反而变成了人的一个**定义**。而这些**定义**合起来，便定义了**什么是*人***——也就是“*德*”，使得*人*而成为*人*的东西。因此我们看到，事实上“*德*”也是由“*仁*”生成的，但是我们在理解上却认为，是因“*德*”而生“*仁*”：因为你是*人*，所以你要有*仁*。最后，“*德*”是一种一般的规律，因为凡事诸物皆有其*德*（我们认为他应该遵守的规律，使得一样东西成为其本身的东西），因而又将所有的“*德*”合起来，归纳抽象出“*道*”，因此“*道*”实则为“*德*”而生成的，我们却理解为“*道*”生成了“*德*”。\n    27→\n    28→因此，整个逻辑的顺序就被倒反过来。道生德，人德为仁，因仁生义，因义行礼。而这最后的“*礼*”已经不再是一开始的“*现象礼*”，因为从“*现象礼*”生成“*道*”的逻辑已经被**掩埋不见**，已经全部**失**去了，人们以为“*道*”才是最元始的*元物理*。因此最终生成的“*礼*”已然仅仅是一种规范，而不一定是最初的（解释上）发乎于心的而有的*现象礼*了。\n    29→\n    30→在实践中，这种失将继续层层下跌，逐末而忘本。上述并非对《老子》的解释，而是在这一段当中，恰好出现了这种自形而上至形的阶梯，因此将此作为一个例子。\n    31→\n    32→### 形而上\n    33→\n    34→在上述的例子中，我用了中国哲学举例。然而，中国哲学大多是有*形而上*而无*形而上学*的。所谓形而上学，既是研究形而上的学科和学问，是对形而上的学习和分析。在西方，形而上学追求的是*终极实在*，既是最终的，最原始的*元物理*——*根源*之所在。而在中国，大多数时候，我们在一个给定好的*形而上*的框架中抵达这个框架中的*至善*，追求的是*圣人*，因而一是皆以*修身*为*本*。对于*形而上*的探索（也就是*形而上学*）因而相较西方要少了许多。因此，一定要区分*形而上*和*形而上学*的区别。*形而上*是我们对现象的一种**理解**、**解释**。而*形而上学*是对形而上的**研究**。\n    35→\n    36→\n    37→在这里我将形而上分为如下几种：\n    38→\n    39→#### *第〇种*：经验的总结\n    40→\n    41→形而上的核心是***恒常***。我们需要在变化的现象之中寻找到（追求）一种*恒常*性，因此我们才能够有意作出任何有（对于我们而言的）结果的行为。有人将形而上学的基础总结为*同一*，*因果*。然而，*因果*即为时间上的*同一*，因此其本质上是一回事。我在这里将其称之为*恒常*。*恒常*的意义是一种（我们给自己的）“**保证**”。这个**保证**既是：同样的*现象*（*实在*）将会**重复**的出现。\n    42→\n    43→也就是说，我们首先认为，我们眼前的一个苹果（的图像），在下一刻，他和这一刻，是**同一个***东西*——既是*恒常*。\n    44→我们看着这个苹果（的图像）在我们的视野中变化位置，缩放，甚至旋转（旋转改变了他的图像，因而递进），我们却依旧认为这是**同一个***东西*——既是*恒常*。\n    45→\n    46→我们根据我们**眼前的**这个**具体的**[^5]苹果的图像，构建了一个（具体的）“*东西*”，也就是这一个**具体**的（我们认为是）“客观存在的”苹果，这个（具体的）“*东西*”，相对于变化的*现象*，既是*恒常*。\n    47→注意到，这个“*东西*”实则我们对我们**眼前的**苹果图像的**解释**——他是由现象中的苹果图像所*生成*的。我们把这个“*东西*”叫做“*第二实在*”。\n    48→\n    49→我们看到了数个不同的具体的苹果，我们从他们的相似之处中*抽象*出了一个“苹果”的概念。这也是*恒常*。这个“*理想的‘苹果’*”，或者说，这个“*形而上的苹果*”，是我们对具体的苹果的*归纳*（*抽象*）[^6]。\n    50→\n    51→我们把这两种恒常叫做*第〇种形而上*。\n    52→\n    53→#### *第一种*：经验的预测\n    54→\n    55→*第一种形而上*必须要基于*第〇种形而上*。他是基于*第〇种形而上*之上的*恒常*：总是发生的事情（大概率）会（在未来或者空间中）**重复**发生[^7]。\n    56→\n    57→例一：我看到了**很多次**苹果树上结苹果，苹果变大了掉下来。所以我认为苹果树**以后**也会**重复**地结苹果，他结的苹果**以后**也会**重复**地掉下来——是为*恒常*。\n    58→\n    59→例二：李四**每次**用我的东西都会送回来，张三**每次**用我的东西都大多自己拿走了。所以我认为，**以后**李四用我的东西也**都**会送回来，张三**以后**用我的东西也**都**大多自己拿走了——是为*恒常*。\n    60→\n    61→#### *第二种*：经验的抽象\n    62→\n    63→我们将第一种形而上*归纳*，*抽象*为一种概念，例如“*诚信*”——是为*恒常*。\n    64→\n    65→我们注意到，*第〇、一、二种形而上*，都是同样的两步过程：对**重复**事物的认知（这种认知是*恒常*的，因其认知正在于其**重复**）[^8]，然后将这种认知抽象理解，**固定**为一个（*形而上*）*概念*（这个*概念*是*恒常*的，因其已经**脱离***现象*而恒在）[^9]。第一步既是*第一种形而上*，第二步既是*第二种形而上*。\n    66→\n    67→所谓*第〇种*，其实只是*第一种*（步）和*第二种*（步）最简单（trivial）和基础（fundamental）的形式。第〇种更强调的是其原材料**全部**来自于（“原始的”）*现象* [^10]，而*第一二种*中，其原材料除了来自于（“原始的”）*现象*，也来自于已有的*概念*（*形而上*）[^11]。\n    68→\n    69→注意到，这种“*归纳*”，是**合**，也是**分**。他界定了什么是**同一个**东西/概念——于是也界定了哪些**不是同一种**东西/概念。\n    70→\n    71→#### *第三种*：抽象的组合\n    72→\n    73→*第三种形而上*，便是对*第二种形而上*的理解。他**连接**不同的*形而上*，又自*形而上*而产生*形而上*——也就是说，他是对已有*形而上*的一种**形式化**，因此他可能是一种**框架**、一种**价值**。\n    74→\n    75→---- \n    76→\n    77→注意到，我们提到了两种形而上的“理解”。第一种是自下而上的，例如形式为*归纳*的理解：我们看到了高楼林立，因此我们把高楼林立的地方归纳为城市。另一方面，则是自上而下的，形式为*定义*的理解：我们认为城市**应当**是高楼林立的。甚至我们可以通过再其上的形而上（*第三种*），重新定义城市，再要求具体的城市具有哪些功能和特征。这也是自上而下的。有了实践作为桥梁，自下而上将会影响到自上而下，而自上而下也会影响到自下而上。因而最终上述几种形而上会夹杂在一起[^12]。\n    78→\n    79→### 客观世界\n    80→\n    81→*客观世界*是**基于***现象*而提出的一种**模型**。按照本篇中的定义，所谓“*客观世界*”，既是由*第二实在*所构成的“世界”。即是说，我们认识中的*客观世界*，是以*现象*，既*第一实在*，为**基础**，所**生成**的对*现象*其本身的**解释**。在这个解释之中，**形式上**是由*客观世界*生成了被我们所观测到的世界，也就是*现象*。\n    82→\n    83→**形式上**，倘若一开始没有任何东西，那么**先**存在一个**真正的***客观世界*，和**先**存在*现象*，有着巨大的区别（也没有任何区别）。当我们说“**先**存在一个**真正的***客观世界*”时，*现象*是生成的，然后自生成的现象上，生成了**认识中的***客观世界*（而**不**是**真正的***客观世界*）[^13]。当我们说，“**先**存在*现象*”时，就**不**存在**真正的***客观世界*，只存在“**真正的**

   86→\n    87→\n    88→#### 附录：关于本篇中“形而上”一词的一点说明\n    89→\n    90→“形而上学”一词，乃是自英文“metaphysics”翻译而来。其中，“形而上”，取自《易经系辞传》第八章第五节：\n    91→\n    92→> 是故形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器，化而裁之谓之变，推而行之谓之通，举而措之天下之民，谓之事业。\n    93→\n    94→在本片文章中，对将形解为“现象”。现象是一切的基础，因而是最下者。因此这种解释有异于系辞传中“形”的本意。如果要一一对应，还是以苹果为例子，那么系辞传中的形对应于本篇中的“理想中的‘苹果’”，器对应于对应于*第二实在*的苹果。\n    95→\n    96→## 前形而上学的讨论\n    97→\n    98→一般认为，形而上学的末路是*虚无主义*。\n    99→\n   100→在我看来，形而上学的发展有其脉络。其脉络既是对于终极实在的层层回避，步步后退，而向着实用性逐渐靠近的过程。因为愈探求，愈不可探求，因为“事实上并不存在这样的终极实在可以背触及”。随着“最高价值”（既“终极实在”）的丧失，形而上学的大厦自然地倒塌，留下的遗迹被称之为虚无主义。虚无主义不是一种有、一种主义，而是一种无，一种缺位。虚无主义不是被生产、创造出来的，正如虚空并不是被生产创造出来的，而是因为没有生产和创造了，这里什么都没有而已。\n   101→\n   102→但是，注意到，虚无主义中的大部分议题实际上是**非理性**的。\n   103→\n   104→### 非理性\n   105→\n   106→显然的，理性的目的必然要在理性之外[^23]，所以，理性的目的必然是非理性的——也就是说，理性仅仅作为一种工具而存在。\n   107→\n   108→因此我们自然的知道，**对*终极实在*的追求本身就是非理性的**（形而上学本身就是非理性的）。因此，虚无主义之所以能够被提出来（虚无主义之所以是虚无**主义**、之所以使得“没有终极实在”成为一种议题）的原因也是**非理性**的。\n   109→\n   110→而形而上学和虚无主义之所以是非理性的原因，是因为我们对*形而上*的**追求**是非理性的。因为倘若不存在任何的形而上，那么我们面对现象就没有任何“抓手”——我们就无法（对于我们而言）有意义的作出任何行为[^19]。也就是说，我们（看似理性的）对*形而上*的**追求**其实就是我们**非理性**的对*恒常性*的追求。而这种**非理性**是应当被**承认**的[^20]。因为这种非理性所造成的结果既是使得理想和现象重叠，使得我们能够（似乎是主观的）作出任何（有主观意义上的结果的）实践。\n   111→\n   112→这种非理性的由来，在追求恒常性之上，我认为还有一层，即是我们需要这种“实践”。这种理想和现象的重叠，既是“自我实现”（Self Realization，使得自我得以成为现实）——我们在现象中看到我们自身，证实我的存在，使得现象成为“我的一部分”（籍于理想和现象的重叠，我们在现象中重现了我的理想）。\n   113→\n   114→## 后形而上学\n   115→\n   116→后形而上学，必然是虚无主义之后才可以产生的形而上学。以我所见，所谓后形而上学，既是以现象为核心，承认所有形而上皆为现象之上的构造的形而上学。因此，其必须时时刻刻认识到，任何的形而上仅仅是对形的描述和建模——因此其方法论的核心必然要将形而上和现象紧密的联系在一起。因此我所见到的大道既是前述的“理想和现象之重叠”——实践。\n   117→\n   118→*后形而上学*，同*前形而上学*一样，是一种*形式化*的*形而上*（即 *第三种形而上*）。与*前形而上学*的区别在于，后形而上学对“价值”、“意义”、“本质”一类的*第〇实在*进行了祛魅：认识到对这些概念的追求来源于一种*非理性*。这一认知立刻自然导致了如下改变：\n   119→1. *第〇实在*不再具有特殊的位置，因为其特殊位置是由*非理性*给定的（直到我们理性的给定这样一个人造的目的为止，但是此时任何*形而上*都可以被如此给定）。\n   120→2. *现象*现在被放到了特殊的位置[^21]。我们意识到任何的*形而上*仅仅是对*现象|形*的描述和建模。\n   121→\n   122→这些改变使得我们需要重申如下结果：\n   123→1. 再次强调，*后形而上学*是形式化的*形而上*。\n   124→2. 在整个形式化体系中，*非理性*得到了承认。这一承认在认识上有两点：承认其（不可避免的）存在、和承认其效果（如承认人对*形而上*的追求）。这两点都我们作为人进行*形而上*的结果[^22]。\n   125→3. *后形而上学*，作为一种*形而上*，具有一种功能性：理想和现象之重叠——*实践*。这一功能性同时具有*非理性*层面上的目的性。\n   126→\n   127→----\n   128→\n   129→请读者移步至《[[形而上学后的目的：诗意]]》文章继续关于后形而上学的探讨。\n   130→\n   131→\n   132→[^1]:\t在本篇文章中，以*这样*的文字作为特指、特定的名称、引用的名称，以**这样**的文字作为强调，以这样的文字作为句子中给出的可以当作定义的段落。\n   133→\n   134→[^2]:\t这里是想要给出一个传统上的定义。\n   135→\n   136→[^3]:\t仁义礼实则是已经是一套形而上的框架了。而我们又不得不借助一些框架来描述现象，因而即便我极力尝试还原其作为现象的本来面貌，但是其仍旧是失准的。中国哲学常将仁义并提。所谓仁，是谓爱人。所谓义，是谓应当。按照形式上的理解，以爱父亲这一仁来举例。我爱我的父亲所应当做的，就是义。而这个义的具体行为，则是礼。因而义是连接仁和具体行为（礼）的那个东西。在现象上，我这里用现象仁来描述我内心对我父亲的某种（爱的）感受，这个感受使得（推动）我去做一些行为。那么这种推动力，这种“motivation”本身，就是连接我的这种感受（现象仁）和我的这种行为（现象礼）的东西，因而把它叫做现象义是合适的。\n

155→\n   156→[^13]:\t而**认识中的***客观世界*也并不是对**真正的***客观世界*的拟合，而是对*现象*的拟合（以期望达成对**真正的***客观世界*的拟合）。\n   157→\n   158→[^14]:\t因为对于我们而言现象已经是最下者。\n   159→\n   160→[^15]:\t这个逻辑和先前讨论的*道*是相同的。在形式上，是*道*生万物，然而事实上，*道*才是被生成的。因此，**形式上**，倘若真的有真正的*道*，既*第〇实在*（或者更下），当他被提出就成为了*第二实在*（或者更上），因而真正的*道*不可道不可名，无可讨论无法提出。\n   161→\n   162→[^19]:\t假设**我**是有（理性和非理性的）目的性的。那么如果我**完全**不知道做一件事情的后果，那么做不做这件事情**对我而言**就没有区别。就像是拿手指在波涛汹涌的海洋（现象）中随手搅拌一样。\n   163→\n   164→[^20]:\t这种承认是出于一种目的而承认的。\n   165→\n   166→[^21]:\t这是基于我们（作为人）的认知而导致的。\n   167→\n   168→[^22]:\t这也是基于我们（作为人）的认知而导致的。\n   169→\n   170→[^23]: “理性的目的在理性之外”这是一个关于“目的”的分析判断：一个东西要抵达的地方不可能是他自身，否则他就不会“要抵达”。因此这句话不取决于如何定义理性。\n   171→\n   172→[^24]: 此处需要注意，更加符合道家的关于“道”的解释更类似于使得存在得以成立的那个东西。形象地说，就像是对于一幅画而言的画纸一样。在这里，我们仅仅是结构上表达可以认为“道”决定和产生了“德”。\n   173→\n   174→[^25]: 此处“第一实在”只是名称，而不是现象是否是本体论上具有实在地位的论断。在实践中，对于人而言，现象是首先接触到的、不可绕过的。\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

我铺开羊皮纸，开始撰写我新的魔法书。让我看看之前这本书上开头的两个魔法……哦！是*猫猫*变狗术和**鸭鸭**变狗术。哼……多么的简单！我挥动羽毛笔，写下了——*猫猫*和**鸭鸭**都变狗狗术！这可是在之前的这本书上都没有的全新魔法！（因为之前书上的魔法并没有作用于两个动物身上都有效的魔法）如此简单的任务真是令我发笑！我如法炮制，迅速的写完了这本魔法书——《复合动物变形指南——一年级》（$\\mathcal

**猪猪鼠鼠**全都变成狗狗术”！我如法炮制……迅速的写完了这本魔法书——《复合动物变形指南——二年级》，把他放在了《复合动物变形指南——一年级》的旁边。（$\\mathcal T_2$是两册书一起。那些出现在第二册中的魔法的绝对元阶为2。出现在第一册中的魔法的绝对元阶为1。）\n   126→3. 我按照这样的摸鱼方法，开始继续写下一本书。当然！我每次的新书都会参考我从一年级开始的所有书！这能大大提高摸鱼效率。比如说在第一本书里我写过了“*猫猫和鸭鸭*都变狗狗术”，在第二本书里我写过了\"**狮狮虎虎蛙蛙獭獭**全都变成狗狗术\"，那我自然要在第三本里写下“*猫猫鸭鸭* **狮狮虎虎蛙蛙獭獭**大变狗狗术”！。\n   127→4. 如此简单的任务！在那一个下午，我按照相同的套路，摸鱼了——几乎无数本魔法书！\n   128→\n   129→注意到该魔法教授构造新一元阶魔法的方法将会使得在最后一本魔法书中，将有可能包含将所有动物都变成绵羊的真正终极变羊术。但是不会包含把所有动物都变成狗的真正终极变狗术，因为狗在$\\mathcal

131→注意到，本质上来说，“*猫猫*和**鸭鸭**都变狗狗术”是为了帮助读者直觉上去理解高阶射态，他实际上是一个把“*猫猫*变狗术”和“**鸭鸭**变狗术”相互转换的魔法。有了这一魔法后，我们自然可以创造一个新的魔法：把“‘*猫猫*变狗’和‘**鸭鸭**变狗’相互转换术”和“*猫猫*变狗术”（或者“**鸭鸭**变狗术”）相互“加”在一起，得到一个“*猫猫*和**鸭鸭**都变狗狗术”。这个“*猫猫*和**鸭鸭**都变狗狗术”和“‘*猫猫*变狗’‘**鸭鸭**变狗’相互转换术’”具有相同的结构，因为每一个“‘*猫猫*变狗’和‘**鸭鸭**变狗’相互转换术”都可以找到一个唯一的“*猫猫*和**鸭鸭**都变狗狗术”。\n

World（物质世界），或者是Physics（物理法则）。我用P以指代是任何在某理论中被认为是第一实在的东西（例如说，一些人可能会认为P除了物质世界之外，还应当加上（客观的）Spirit World（精神世界）。\n   147→\n   148→本文中，P最终应当指代现象（Phenomenon）。并且我将用“感受”和“体验”一词以指代P中的任何一个部分。其原因在于，即便对于客观世界模型来说，任何对于我们有影响的事物都必须通过“感受”或者“体验”以“进入”我们的“视野”以成为“现象”。因此“全部的感受之总和”既是现象。\n   149→\n   150→在本文中，我将用$\\mathfrak P$以指代完整的P，即是“全部的感受之总和”、完整的现象，而用$\\mathfrak p$以指代某部分的P，例如“所有我从手机中所接受到的信息”。\n   151→\n   152→### E\n   153→\n   154→以P为范例，在这里，我拟用代号E（$\\mathbb E$或$\\mathcal

P$的一部分。例如$\\mathfrak p$，并构造$\\mathfrak p$上的结构$\\mathcal E_\\mathfrak p$。此后我将使用$\\mathcal E$指代$\\mathbb E$或者某些$\\mathfrak p$上的$\\mathcal E_\\mathfrak p$。\n   161→\n   162→注意到，$\\mathcal E$中的态射也是$\\mathfrak P$中的部分（即感受），因此即是说，$\\mathcal E$当中的态射也是$\\mathcal E$中的对象，因此我们可以断言$\\mathcal E$的结构是塔式结构。\n   163→\n   164→注意到，你可以通过内省来**体验**和**验证**这个结构$\\mathcal E$。也就是说，如果想要获取某一个特定的感受$a$，可以以$\\mathcal E$中$a$所处的结构位置作为地图去唤醒这个特定的感受。\n   165→\n   166→#### 附言\n   167→\n   168→值得注意的是，一个更加恰当的描述是使用*纯态射范畴*（arrows-only metacategory）。通过将单位元和其对应对象等同，两者构成相同的数学结构。为了方便理解，这里继续使用常见的范畴的语言。\n   169→\n   170→在数学上，可以认为$\\mathfrak P$是某种意义上在范畴论中常使用的\"universe\"或者Large Categories，不过其边界被限定为给定的P。某种意义上，$\\mathcal E$是对$\\mathfrak P$这种“无结构的大集类”中元素的选取。选取所构成的$\\mathcal E$作为塔式结构中的对象和射态具有相同的地位（正如$\\mathfrak P$中并不区分对象和射态）。通过塔式构造重构$\\mathcal E$即是通过赋予元阶，对塔式结构$\\mathcal E$中的对象赋予了分层结构的过程。这一点将在后续讨论到。\n   171→\n   172→## 形而上：A1策略\n   173→\n   174→A1策略是使用范畴论描述境的一个尝试。\n   175→\n   176→### 联想和形而上\n   177→\n   178→$\\mathcal E$中的态射，如前所述，被称之为联想。例如说，我看到铅笔而想到钢笔，因而联想，做为一个态射，链接了铅笔和钢笔。与此同时，这一联想也作为一个对象而存在于$\\mathcal E$中，即是那个我看到铅笔而想到钢笔的那种“感受”。这种感受可能源于铅笔和钢笔当中的某种**相似性**（一般由感官的模糊性导致）。在这种情况下，遵照先前的魔法书例子，我们可以将许多种**类似**的对象（例如蜡笔、粉笔）和他们两两之间的联想当作是$\\mathcal E$中某种构造中的$\\mathcal T_1$（或者说，我们将这些对象选择作为基石），那么必然在$\\mathcal T_\\infty$中存在某种“终极联想”，即终对象，这个终对象的一个表示即是那种感觉，那种我看到这些**类似**的东西都会感受到的那种感觉（而这种感觉在这种状况下意味着某种终极的**相似性**）——我们把这个感觉叫做*笔*。\n   179→\n   180→注意到，*笔*这一概念是一种对具体的、个别的笔（例如铅笔、或者例如这支我拿在手上的笔）的*形而上*。推而广之，我们给出*形而上*的如下定义：\n   181→\n   182→> 一个*形而上*$m$是$\\mathcal E$中的联想，且$m$在$\\mathcal E$的某个子范畴中是范性质。我们将这个子范畴记作$\\mathcal E_m$，简记成$\\mathcal M$。\n   183→\n   184→注意到，不是所有子范畴内都存在范性质。\n   185→\n   186→#### 例子：忒修斯之船\n   187→\n   188→什么是忒修斯之船（忒修斯之船的本质是什么）？忒修斯之船即是那个我们看到任意的“忒修斯之船的碎片或关联物”（如船的部件）都会联想到的东西（体验）、或是当我们提到时会联想到所有的“忒修斯之船的碎片或关联物”的那个东西（体验）。也就是说，他是某一个体验（$\\mathfrak p_{Theseus}$中的一部分），某一个和这艘船（$\\mathfrak p_{\\text{Theseus}}$中的一部分）上的所有部件都相关的体验。这个特定的体验即是关于忒修斯之船 的$\\mathcal E_{\\text{Theseus}}$的泛性质，是当我们提到忒修斯之船时的“本质”。\n   189→\n   190→如果我们将物理世界作为$\\mathfrak P$，我们可以定义物质意义上的$\\mathcal E$。此时$\\mathcal E$当中的全部对象即是任意忒修斯之船的部分（例如说甲板，和甲板上的这一块和那一块木板，和船舵）。注意到，此时空总是$\\mathcal E$中的对象，也是他的子范畴中的对象。我们不妨将包含关系当作$\\mathcal E$上的态射（他作为对象是什么？），那么此时，_忒修斯之船_（我在这里使用了简记，用*忒修斯之船*以指代$\\mathcal E_{\\text{Theseus}}$）的范性质有两种：始对象即是完整的忒修斯之船（包含了任何一个对象）、终对象即是空（被任何对象所包含）。因此，在如此选定的$\\mathfrak P$上，我们必然会出现忒修斯悖论：\n   191→\n   192→> 如果忒修斯的船上的木头逐渐被替换，直到所有的木头都不是原来的木头，那这艘船还是原来的那艘船吗？\n   193→\n   194→并且我们会得到忒修斯之船的本质即是无这样的谬论——因为无确实是*忒修斯之船*的范性质。这一悖论的原因即是我们对$\\mathfrak P$的错误选取——$\\mathfrak P$应当被选择为现象而非物理世界，因为*忒修斯之船*之形而上并不存在于物理世界，而存在于我们的脑海之中。\n   195→\n   196→同样的，我们注意到，当我们选取$\\mathfrak P$为现象时，$\\mathcal E$上的态射不应单独的选择为包含关系。例如说，当我们追问我是谁的时候，我们常常把自己的特征去掉（如果我不会弹钢琴了，我还是我么？），直至最后得到了“空”这样的答案。倘若以范性质以描述我，“我”是那个感受，那个当你提到任何有关我的方面时，都会让我联想到的那个感受，这个感受即是我。\n   197→\n   198→练习：试分析秃头悖论：当一个人少了多少根头发，我们会认为他秃了？\n   199→\n   200→#### 例子：什么是人？\n   201→\n   202→另外一个例子是“什么是人”。“人”即是当你看到所有你认为是人的时候所想到的，感受到的那个感觉，那个感觉就告诉了你什么是“人”。\n   203→\n   204→但是我们常常还会想要一些更多关于我们认为什么是“人”的信息。那么我们自然可以探索，在以这个感觉作为范性质（形而上）的子范畴中，那些元阶介于这一感觉和看到具体的人之间的那些感受和东西，例如说，有什么样的手、有什么样的脸、有什么样的社会性，等等。\n   205→\n   206→要注意到，这一回答不是本体论的回答，而是实践上的回答：这就是我们在描述我们所认为的“什么是人”的时候唯一能做的事情，正如当小孩问他们的父母，“什么是人？”时，他的父母唯一能做的一样。\n   207→\n   208→#### 例子：对象化（Objectification）\n   209→\n   210→当工人创造其工作成果时，这一行为有时会用对象化一词来形容。有的时候，工人的劳动成果被看作是工人的“我”的一部分。在这个时候，所谓“我的一部分”，其意义在于生产成果是工人认识自身的一种途径：人在劳动成果中“认出自己”，由此，成果不仅属于人，而且是人的延伸，构成人的“现实的我”。\n   211→\n   212→我们在这里提出一种新的，类似的对象化。回想，按照我们的定义：\n   213→\n   214→> “我”是那个感受，那个当你提到任何有关我的方面时，都会让我联想到的那个感受，这个感受即是我。\n   215→\n   216→当工人看到自己的产品时，会感受到这个东西其中自己倾注其中的具体工作和努力，由此会体验和联想到“我”的感受。正如当我们想到我们的身体时，激活了“我”的感受一样，这个产品也成为了“我”的一部分，加入了以“我”作为范性质（形而上）的子范畴中。\n   217→\n   218→### 元阶？\n   219→\n   220→我们注意到，$\\mathcal E$是$\\mathfrak p$上的结构，即是说，$\\mathcal E$是描述性的，是一种对$\\mathfrak p$的理解，而非构造性的，一种对$\\mathfrak p$的定义。也就是说，我们所面对的$\\mathcal E$（几乎）是不区分元阶的。请看如下例子：\n   221→\n   222→#### 例子：龙血\n   223→\n   224→>生活在魔法之都的约翰出生于炼金世家，从小他就对各种炼金原料了如指掌：例如说人血和龙血。在他的眼中，人血就是人的血、而龙血就是龙的血。他们都是血，只是从不同的生物身上得道而已。\n   225→\n   226→我们可以说，人、龙、血对于约翰都是同一元阶的，倘若我们将人、龙、血，作为基石，那么显然，人、龙、血都是1元阶对象；而人血和龙血则都是2元阶对象。\n   227→\n   228→>在遥远的北方，有着一座被巨龙统治的小镇。卢克打小就生活在此，在他的印象中，龙是不可战胜，无可损伤的，然而在龙的压迫下，镇民的生活一日不如一日，反抗的低语此起彼伏，但是却没有人胆敢攻击那无可战胜的龙。然而，卢克有一日却忽然意识到——他从未见过龙受过伤……但是龙血应该也是存在的吧？就和人血一样？ （to do：not a good example）\n   229→\n   230→我们可以说，人血、龙对于卢克都是同1元阶的，倘若我们将人血、龙作为基石，那么显然，人血、龙都是1元阶对象；而根据人血和龙而联想到的龙血，则是2元阶对象。\n   231→\n   232→> 在过了许久之后，卢克和镇民们已经成功反抗的龙的统治，用一把黑剑刺入了龙的心脏。在卢克的晚年，龙血对于他而言已经没有什么特别的了。龙血只是龙的血而已，正如人血只是人的血而已，龙和人一样，都只是会受伤的生物罢了。\n   233→\n   234→我们可以说，此时，人、龙、血对于卢克都是同一元阶的，倘若我们将人、龙、血，作为基石，那么显然，人、龙、血都是1元阶对象；而人血和龙血则都是2元阶对象。\n   235→\n   236→----\n   237→\n   238→为什么会产生这种无法区分元阶的情况呢？其原因在于元阶的定义依赖于第一章所介绍的构造方法，$\\mathcal T_n$总是由$\\mathcal T_{n-1}$所*生成*的，给定某种构造，我们才可以定义元阶——或者说，当我们给对象指定元阶时，我们就确定了一组特定的构造方法。但是$\\mathcal E$本身并不是被构造出来的，**$\\mathcal E$是$\\mathfrak p$上的结构**，而不是$\\mathfrak p$是$\\mathcal E$的结果。\n   239→\n   240→我们并不能够直接说*笔*的概念生成了*铅笔*，因为我们可能先知道了铅笔，然后将许多笔抽象，得到了笔的概念，我们也不能够直接说*铅笔*的概念生成了*笔*，因为可能我之前见过许多笔，有了笔的概念，但是却没有见到过铅笔，于是用*笔*的概念想到了一种特别的用石墨做芯的笔（也就是铅笔）。\n   241→\n   242→###  构造（Construction）和形而上学\n   243→\n

Legenravend/49 Workspace/Buddhism/Dictionary.md","content":"---\nmodified: 2026-02-10\ncreated: 2026-02-10\n---\n# Translation Dictionary: Buddhism Expert\n\n**Prepared by:** Buddhism (Madhyamaka/Yogacara/Chan-Zen) Specialist\n**For:** jing-translation team\n**Date:** 2026-02-10\n\n---\n\nThis dictionary provides translation recommendations for key philosophical terms in the 境集 collection, with special attention to Buddhist philosophical considerations, Sanskrit-Chinese-English translation chains, and the critical distinction between the author's usage and Buddhist technical meanings.\n\n---\n\n## 境 (E)\n\n- **Main translation**: \"E\" (technical passages), \"Scape\" or \"Experiential Scape\" (discursive passages)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Experiential Domain\" when emphasizing the bounded nature\n  - \"Phenomenal Structure\" when emphasizing the categorical construction\n  - Keep untranslated as \"jing\" with explanatory note when Buddhist resonance is critical\n- **Note**: This term carries the full weight of Buddhist **visaya** (विषय, sense-object), **gocara** (गोचर, range/domain), and **ayatana** (आयतन, sense-base). In Chinese Buddhist translation:\n  - **Kumarajiva** used 境 to translate visaya in Yogacara texts, meaning \"object-domain of consciousness\"\n  - **Xuanzang** used 境界 for gocara in Vijnaptimatratasiddhi (成唯識論), meaning \"range of activity\"\n  - Traditional usage: 境 is what consciousness takes as its object, NOT an independent external world\n\n  **Author's transformation**: The author preserves the Buddhist insight that 境 is structured by mind, not \"the world out there,\" but adds unprecedented formal precision through category theory. The author's E is simultaneously: (1) the experiential field (Buddhist visaya), (2) the structure imposed on that field (Yogacara vijnapti-structuring), and (3) a categorical system with tower structure that can be formally analyzed. This is NOT a departure from Buddhist meaning but a mathematical formalization of it.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: \"Realm\" loses the Buddhist resonance and implies ontological independence. \"Sphere\" or \"domain\" are too generic. \"World\" is too ontologically loaded. \"Scape\" (from landscape/dreamscape) preserves the phenomenological (what appears), structured (shaped by mind), and bounded (limited range) dimensions. Use \"E\" in technical passages to maintain the author's formal notation.\n\n---\n\n## 境界\n\n- **Main translation**: \"bounds,\" \"horizon,\" \"domain-and-limit\"\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"experiential boundary\" when emphasizing delimitation\n  - \"level of attainment\" when the Buddhist resonance of spiritual progress is relevant\n- **Note**: In Buddhist usage, 境界 carries two overlapping meanings:\n  - **Spatial sense**: the boundary or extent of a domain (e.g., 語言的境界 = the bounds of language)\n  - **Soteriological sense**: level of spiritual attainment (e.g., 菩薩境界 = the level/state of a bodhisattva)\n\n  The author uses primarily the first sense, but the second sense creates resonance when discussing \"清醒的梦境\" (lucid dreamscape) as a transformed state of awareness. The term implies both \"where this domain reaches\" and \"what can be reached within this domain.\"\n\n  **Translation rationale**: \"Bounds\" captures both meanings—spatial limits and accessible range. Avoid \"boundary\" alone (too rigid), \"limit\" alone (too restrictive), \"scope\" (too academic/neutral).\n\n---\n\n## 虚无 / 虚無主義\n\n- **Main translation**: \"nihilism\" (虚無主義), \"the void\" or \"emptiness-as-absence\" (虚无)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the vacancy\" or \"the absence\" when emphasizing lack\n  - \"nothingness\" when existentialist resonance is appropriate\n- **Note**: **CRITICAL DISTINCTION** from Buddhist 空 (śūnyatā/sunyata):\n\n  **Buddhist 空 (śūnyatā)**: NOT nihilism (断見, uccheda-vada). In Madhyamaka, emptiness (空) means absence of **svabhava** (自性, inherent existence), NOT absence of phenomena. Nagarjuna's MMK 24.18: \"Whatever is dependently originated, that we call emptiness.\" Emptiness is the Middle Way between eternalism and nihilism.\n\n  **Kumarajiva's translation strategy**: Used 空 (empty) rather than 無 (non-being) to avoid confusion with nihilism. The Chinese character 無 (wu) suggests absolute non-existence; 空 (kong) suggests empty-of-something (empty of svabhava).\n\n  **Author's 虚无**: The void LEFT AFTER metaphysics collapses. The author explicitly states: \"Nihilism is not a being, not a doctrine (主义), but an absence, a vacancy (缺位)... nothing is being produced or created anymore.\" This IS the nihilistic extreme (断邊) that Madhyamaka warns against. However, the author does NOT remain here—post-metaphysics is the exit from this void, parallel to the Middle Way.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Translate 虚无主義 as \"nihilism\" but ALWAYS include translator's note distinguishing from Buddhist emptiness (空). When 虚无 appears alone, consider \"the void\" or \"nihilistic vacancy\" to emphasize the negative, absence-character. Never translate 虚无 as \"emptiness\" (which should be reserved for 空/śūnyatā).\n\n---\n\n## 空\n\n- **Main translation**: \"emptiness\" (when referring to Buddhist śūnyatā), \"empty\" (adjectival)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"void\" only when clearly distinguished from 虚无\n  - \"vacuity\" in philosophical contexts requiring precision\n- **Note**: This term appears rarely in the author's text, but when it does, it carries Buddhist technical meaning:\n\n  **Sanskrit śūnyatā → Chinese 空**: The central concept of Madhyamaka philosophy. Emptiness of svabhava (inherent existence), NOT emptiness of existence. The Diamond Sutra (金剛經): \"All conditioned phenomena are like a dream, an illusion\" (一切有為法，如夢幻泡影) describes emptiness, not non-existence.\n\n  **Author's minimal usage**: In the example \"when we strip away our characteristics... we eventually arrive at 'emptiness' (空),\" the author acknowledges this is the WRONG approach (choosing containment relations on physical objects rather than phenomena as P). The author's framework avoids reifying 空 as a metaphysical ultimate, which aligns with Madhyamaka's rejection of 空 itself as a view to be grasped.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"emptiness\" for 空 when Buddhist resonance is clear. Never conflate with 虚无. If both terms appear in proximity, use \"emptiness\" (空) vs. \"the void/nihilism\" (虚无) to maintain distinction.\n\n---\n\n## 清醒\n\n- **Main translation**: \"lucid\" (清醒的梦境 = lucid dreamscape)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"wakeful\" or \"clear-seeing\" in non-dreamscape contexts\n  - \"aware\" when emphasizing consciousness without Buddhist overtones\n- **Note**: 清醒 literally means \"clear-awake\" and carries overtones of Buddhist **bodhi** (覺, awakening). In Chinese Buddhist vocabulary:\n  - 覺 (jue): awakening, enlightenment (bodhi)\n  - 覺醒: to awaken (often used for enlightenment experience)\n  - 清醒: everyday term for being awake/sober, but in philosophical context resonates with 覺\n\n  **Author's usage**: \"清醒的梦境\" (lucid dreamscape) describes engagement with meaning-structures WHILE KNOWING they are constructions. This parallels Chan awakening's third stage: \"After enlightenment, mountains are mountains again\" (青原惟信)—return to full engagement with transformed understanding.\n\n  **Difference from Buddhist awakening**: Buddhist 覺 typically implies cessation of fundamental ignorance (avidya/無明). The author's 清醒 is epistemological (knowing the constructedness) rather than soteriological (liberation from suffering). But the structural parallel is profound: both involve seeing-through without disengaging.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: \"Lucid\" captures both \"clear-seeing\" and the dreamscape context (as in \"lucid dreaming\"—knowing you're dreaming while in the dream). Avoid \"awakened\" (too specifically Buddhist) and \"conscious\" (too Cartesian/neutral). \"Wakeful\" is acceptable but less evocative.\n\n---\n\n## 沉醉\n\n- **Main translation**: \"intoxicated\" (沉醉的梦境 = intoxicated dreamscape)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"immersed\" when intoxication metaphor is too strong\n  - \"entranced\" when emphasizing loss of critical awareness\n- **Note**: 沉醉 literally means \"sink-drunk,\" combining submersion (沉) and intoxication (醉). In Buddhist psychology:\n  - **mada** (憍, 醉): intoxication/pride, one of the klesha (煩惱, afflictions)\n  - **moha** (癡): delusion, fundamental ignorance\n\n  **Author's usage**: \"沉醉的梦境\" describes engagement WITHOUT awareness that meaning-structures are constructions. This is faith/belief (信念/信仰) where purpose appears logically groundless but historically conditioned. The metaphor: drunk on the dream, unaware it's a dream.\n\n  **Buddhist parallel**: Corresponds to pre-awakening state, where one takes conceptual constructions (prapanca/戲論) as ultimately real. The intoxication metaphor recalls Buddhist warnings against the \"intoxicants\" (madya/酒) that cloud discernment.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: \"Intoxicated\" preserves the Buddhist resonance of clouded awareness (mada) and the author's metaphor of being \"drunk\" on meaning. Avoid \"unconscious\" (too negative) and \"naive\" (too judgmental). \"Immersed\" is acceptable but loses the critique of clouded judgment.\n\n---\n\n## 梦境\n\n- **Main translation**: \"dreamscape\"\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"dream-realm\" when emphasizing bounded domain\n  - \"dream-construction\" when emphasizing constructed nature\n- **Note**: 梦 (dream) + 境 (scape/domain). The author explicitly distinguishes this from \"illusion to be dispelled\":\n\n  **Buddhist dream analogy**:\n  - **svapna** (夢): standard example of emptiness in Madhyamaka and Yogacara\n  - **Diamond Sutra**: \"All conditioned phenomena are like a dream\" (如夢幻泡影)\n  - **Madhyamaka usage**: Dream objects FUNCTION within the dream even though they lack inherent existence. A dream fire can warm a dream body. This is NOT nihilism—it's the Middle Way.\n\n  **Author's usage**: 梦境 is the \"environment\" (環境) in which meaning and purpose can exist. Games, novels, rituals, lived frameworks—all are dreamscapes. The author emphasizes: \"清醒的梦境 still necessarily means full engagement\" (清醒的梦境依旧也必然意味着对梦境的全身心之投入). This perfectly parallels the Buddhist bodhisattva who saves beings while knowing there are no beings to save (Diamond Sutra).\n\n  **Critical point**: The author's 梦境 is NOT illusion (幻) to be escaped but structure to be engaged with lucidly. This aligns with Madhyamaka's insistence that emptiness doesn't negate function.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: \"Dreamscape\" (not just \"dream\") captures the spatial/environmental dimension and the constructed-yet-immersive quality. Avoid \"illusion\" (implies falsity to be rejected), \"fantasy\" (too escapist), \"construct\" (too abstract/clinical).\n\n---\n\n## 觉 / 悟\n\n- **Main translation**: \"awakening\" (覺), \"realization\" (悟), or \"enlightenment\" (覺悟)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"insight\" for 悟 in non-technical contexts\n  - \"bodhi\" (untranslated) when Sanskrit reference is critical\n- **Note**: These terms appear minimally in the author's text but are essential background:\n\n  **Buddhist technical terms**:\n  - **覺 (jue)**: Sanskrit **bodhi** (बोधि), awakening/enlightenment\n  - **悟 (wu)**: realization, insight (often used in Chan for sudden awakening, Japanese **satori**)\n  - **覺悟**: compound meaning awakening-realization, the process or event of enlightenment\n\n  **Chinese translation history**:\n  - Kumarajiva: used 覺 for bodhi, emphasizing awakening aspect\n  - Xuanzang: used 覺 for bodhi, 悟 for pratipatti (realization through practice)\n  - Chan tradition: 悟 becomes central (頓悟 sudden awakening, 漸悟 gradual awakening)\n\n  **Author's non-usage**: The author avoids these terms, using instead 清醒 (lucid) and 承認 (recognition/acknowledgment). This is deliberate—avoiding Buddhist technical vocabulary while arriving at structurally similar insights. When discussing \"what Chan calls 悟,\" use \"awakening.\"\n\n  **Translation rationale**: When these terms appear in explanatory/comparative contexts (discussing Buddhist parallels), use \"awakening\" (覺) and \"realization\" (悟). Maintain distinction from the author's 清醒 (lucid).\n\n---\n\n## 恒常\n\n- **Main translation**: \"constancy\"\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"permanence\" only when ontological claim is explicit\n  - \"stability\" when emphasizing functional continuity\n- **Note**: 恒常 (heng chang) = enduring-constant. The author identifies this as \"the core of metaphysics\" (形而上学的核心是恒常):\n\n  **Buddhist contrast: anitya** (無常, impermanence):\n  - **Sanskrit anitya → Chinese 無常**: The first of three marks of existence (trilaksana)\n  - **Buddhist teaching**: Taking the impermanent as permanent (於無常執常) is one of the four cognitive inversions (viparyasa/顛倒)\n  - **Satipatthana Sutta**: Observe arising and passing (samudaya-vaya) in all phenomena\n\n  **Author's analysis**: \"We need to find (pursue) a constancy (恒常) within changing phenomena, so that we can intentionally perform any action with results meaningful to us.\" Constancy is a \"guarantee\" (保證) that same phenomena will REPEAT. This pursuit is non-rational but necessary.\n\n  **Key difference**: Buddhism identifies pursuit of permanence as rooted in **avidya** (ignorance/無明) to be OVERCOME. The author identifies pursuit of constancy as non-rational feature to be RECOGNIZED (承認) and worked with lucidly, not eliminated. This is a different soteriological stance—post-metaphysical constancy-seeking rather than cessation of constancy-seeking.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: \"Constancy\" better than \"permanence\" (which sounds like Buddhist 常/nitya as metaphysical claim). The author's 恒常 is about pursuit of repeatability and stability, not assertion of permanent essences. Avoid \"invariance\" (too mathematical) and \"persistence\" (too weak).\n\n---\n\n## 无常\n\n- **Main translation**: \"impermanence\"\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"impermanent\" (adjectival)\n  - \"transience\" when poetic tone is appropriate\n- **Note**: **Buddhist technical term**:\n  - **Sanskrit anitya → Chinese 無常**: Fundamental teaching across all Buddhist schools\n  - **Three marks of existence** (trilaksana/三法印): All conditioned phenomena are impermanent (anicca/無常), suffering (dukkha/苦), non-self (anatta/無我)\n\n  The author's text does not use 无常 frequently, focusing instead on 恒常 (constancy) as the metaphysical drive. The absence is notable—the author approaches from the phenomenology of our pursuit of stability rather than asserting impermanence as ontological truth.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"impermanence\" (noun) or \"impermanent\" (adjective) for 無常 when discussing Buddhist doctrine. Maintain contrast with author's 恒常 (constancy).\n\n---\n\n## 我\n\n- **Main translation**: \"I,\" \"self,\" \"me\" (depending on grammatical context)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the I\" when discussing 我 as concept/object of analysis\n  - \"ego\" only in psychoanalytic contexts (avoid Buddhist conflation)\n- **Note**: The author provides a formal definition: \"'I' is that feeling, the feeling that whenever you mention any aspect related to me, it causes me to associate—that feeling is me.\" Formally: \"I\" is the universal property (terminal object) of a subcategory whose objects are all experiences related to me.\n\n  **Buddhist anatman** (無我, non-self):\n  - **Sanskrit anatman/anatta → Chinese 無我**: No permanent, unchanging, independent self\n  - **Milindapanha's chariot analogy**: \"Self\" is a designation for the five aggregates (skandha/蘊), not a substance\n  - **Nagarjuna (MMK 18)**: The self cannot be found among the aggregates, yet functions as conventional designation\n\n  **Remarkable convergence**: The author's category-theoretic definition—self as structural position (universal property) in network of associations, not substance—IS the Middle Way on self:\n  - NOT eternalism: there IS a \"feeling of I,\" it's experienceable, not nothing\n  - NOT nihilism: no self-substance; \"I\" is terminal object in subcategory, constituted by relations\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"I\" for 我 in most contexts. Use \"the I\" or \"the self\" when 我 is discussed as philosophical concept. Avoid \"ego\" (Freudian baggage) and \"atman\" (Hindu concept that Buddhism rejects).\n\n---\n\n## 无我\n\n- **Main translation**: \"non-self\" (philosophical), \"selflessness\" (ethical)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"no-self\" when emphasizing negation\n  - \"anatman\" (untranslated) when Sanskrit reference is critical\n- **Note**: **Core Buddhist doctrine**:\n  - **Sanskrit anatman → Chinese 無我**: Denial of permanent, unchanging, independent self (atman)\n  - Across all schools: No entity that is permanent (常), unitary (一), independent (自在), controller (主宰)\n\n  The author rarely uses 无我 explicitly, but the category-theoretic definition of 我 (as universal property, not substance) functionally embodies the anatman teaching. The author arrives at non-self through formal analysis rather than Buddhist practice.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"non-self\" for 無我 in Buddhist contexts. The author's framework achieves non-self structurally without using the term.\n\n---\n\n## 感受 / 受\n\n- **Main translation**: \"feeling\" (感受), \"vedana\" or \"feeling-tone\" (受)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"experience\" when broader than affective tone\n  - \"sensation\" when emphasizing sensory origin\n- **Note**: The author uses 感受 extensively as foundational category. In the footnote: \"感受 has two meanings: (1) received information, i.e., stimuli; (2) the 'crystallization,' 'surge,' 'turbulence' that these construct. The second kind is also 感受.\"\n\n  **Buddhist vedana** (受):\n  - **Sanskrit vedana → Chinese 受**: One of five aggregates (skandha/蘊)\n  - **Buddhist definition**: Affective tone (pleasant/unpleasant/neutral) arising from contact (phassa/觸)\n  - **Dependent origination**: Contact → feeling → craving (vedana → tanha)\n  - **Satipatthana**: Mindfulness of feelings (vedananupassana) is crucial practice\n\n  **Author's usage**: 感受 is more comprehensive than Buddhist 受. The author states: \"feelings exist prior to the concept of I\" (感受存在于我的概念之先)—this aligns with Buddhist teaching that vedana is part of five aggregates (including feeling) that PRECEDE any reified self. But the author's 感受 includes what Buddhism would categorize across multiple aggregates (vedana, sañña/想/perception, sankhara/行/volitions).\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Translate 感受 as \"feeling\" or \"experience\" depending on context. When discussing Buddhist parallels, note that author's 感受 is broader than Buddhist vedana (受) but includes it. Use \"feeling\" for both to maintain continuity, with footnotes clarifying scope.\n\n---\n\n## 现象\n\n- **Main translation**: \"phenomena\" (plural), \"phenomenon\" (singular)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"appearance\" when emphasizing how things show up\n  - \"what appears\" (discursive)\n- **Note**: The author defines P (phenomena) as \"第一實在\" (First Reality): what is directly encountered, cannot be doubted. All metaphysical constructions are based ON phenomena.\n\n  **Buddhist dharma** (法):\n  - **Sanskrit dharma → Chinese 法**: Phenomena, elements of existence, experiential constituents\n  - **Pali dhamma**: In Theravada, the ultimate constituents of experience\n  - **Abhidharma**: Catalogs dharmas (mental factors, physical factors, etc.)\n\n  **Key distinction**:\n  - **Buddhist 法/dharma**: Analytical categories of experience (including mental factors)\n  - **Author's 现象/phenomena**: What is given prior to interpretation, closer to Pali **paccakkha** (directly experienced)\n  - **Husserlian phenomenology**: Author's usage has resonances but is distinct—less transcendental ego focus\n\n  **Author's critical move**: Phenomena (第一實在) are epistemologically prior. Any \"objective world\" (客觀世界) is a model GENERATED FROM phenomena (第二實在). This is almost precisely the Yogacara position that 境 is vijnapti-matra (唯識所現, appearance-only).\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"phenomena\" for 现象. Add translator's note distinguishing from Husserlian phenomenology (bracketing, transcendental ego) and from Buddhist dharma (analytical categories). The author's phenomena are the given experiential basis, not analyzable elements or noumena-behind-appearances.\n\n---\n\n## 缘起\n\n- **Main translation**: \"dependent origination\"\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"conditioned arising\" (more literal)\n  - \"interdependent co-arising\" (when emphasizing mutuality)\n- **Note**: **Central Buddhist doctrine**:\n  - **Sanskrit pratityasamutpada → Chinese 緣起**: The teaching that all phenomena arise in dependence on conditions (pratyaya/緣)\n  - **Nagarjuna (MMK 24.18)**: \"Whatever is dependently arisen, that we call emptiness\"\n  - **Formula**: \"When this exists, that comes to be; with the arising of this, that arises\" (此有故彼有，此生故彼生)\n\n  **Author's implicit embodiment**: Though the term 缘起 doesn't appear frequently, the author's CORE MOVE embodies it:\n\n  > \"Rather than exploring 'the essence of things' as an inward direction, a more practical orientation is to explore 'the position of things' as an outward (relational) direction... In practice, the exploration of internal essence is 'impossible' because any exploration of internal essence will ultimately convert into an exploration of its external extensions.\"\n\n  This is FORMAL EXPRESSION of pratityasamutpada: things are constituted by relations, not by svabhava (self-nature). In category theory, objects are defined by morphisms—this is the **Yoneda lemma**, which the author implicitly invokes. Buddhist equivalent: a dharma is constituted entirely by conditions and relations.\n\n  **Hua-yen resonance**: The tower structure (morphisms are themselves objects with morphisms) resonates with Hua-yen (華嚴, Avatamsaka) doctrine of **shishi wuai** (事事無礙, interpenetration). Fa-zang's (法藏) Indra's net metaphor—each jewel reflects all others infinitely—is precisely tower-like.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"dependent origination\" for 緣起. When discussing author's relational/categorical approach, note this is formal expression of dependent origination without using Buddhist terminology.\n\n---\n\n## 自性\n\n- **Main translation**: \"self-nature,\" \"inherent existence\"\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"intrinsic nature\" when emphasizing inherent qualities\n  - \"svabhava\" (untranslated) when Sanskrit reference is critical\n- **Note**: **Key term in Madhyamaka**:\n  - **Sanskrit svabhava → Chinese 自性**: Self-nature, own-being, inherent existence\n  - **Nagarjuna's target**: Svabhava is what Madhyamaka REJECTS. No phenomena have svabhava—all are empty (śūnya) of inherent existence.\n  - **Definition**: Svabhava would be existence that is: (1) not dependent on causes/conditions, (2) unchanging, (3) not dependent on conceptual imputation\n\n  **Author's parallel**: The author rejects \"internal essences\" in favor of relational definition. This recapitulates the Buddhist rejection of svabhava WITHOUT using the term. From 范畴论与境:\n\n  > \"Any exploration of internal essence will ultimately convert into an exploration of its external extensions.\"\n\n  Category theory: objects are defined by morphisms (external relations), not internal content. Two objects are \"the same\" (isomorphic) iff they have same morphisms to/from all other objects. This IS the rejection of svabhava—essence is relational, not intrinsic.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"self-nature\" or \"inherent existence\" for 自性 in Buddhist contexts. When discussing the author's rejection of internal essence, note this parallels rejection of svabhava but uses category-theoretic rather than Buddhist language.\n\n---\n\n## 实在\n\n- **Main translation**: \"reality\" (with ordinal prefix when specified: 第一實在 = First Reality)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"what is real\" (discursive)\n  - \"the real\" (when discussing as philosophical category)\n- **Note**: The author's three-level framework:\n  - **第一實在** (First Reality): phenomena as directly encountered. Cannot be doubted. Starting point.\n  - **第二實在** (Second Reality): interpretations, models, concepts built upon phenomena. The \"objective world.\" All metaphysical constructions.\n  - **第〇實在** (Zeroth Reality): putative \"ultimate reality\" behind phenomena. Author's claim: \"When we propose 第〇實在, the very thing we propose BECOMES 第二實在.\"\n\n  **Buddhist two truths** (二諦):\n  - **Samvrti-satya** (世俗諦, conventional truth): ordinary language, concepts, practical engagement\n  - **Paramartha-satya** (勝義諦, ultimate truth): emptiness, absence of inherent existence\n\n  **Comparison**:\n  - Author's 第一實在 (phenomena) = basis for both Buddhist truths, not itself either truth\n  - Author's 第二實在 (constructions) ≈ samvrti-satya (conventional truth)\n  - Author's 第〇實在 (inaccessible ultimate) ≠ paramartha-satya (which IS accessible in Madhyamaka through prajna)\n\n  **Critical divergence**: Madhyamaka's paramartha is NOT behind or below conventional—it IS the emptiness OF the conventional. Accessed not by going elsewhere but seeing THIS differently. Author's 第〇實在 is IN PRINCIPLE inaccessible (closer to Kant's noumenon). However, author's REASON for inaccessibility (articulation is already construction) resonates with Nagarjuna's teaching that ultimate truth transcends conceptual proliferation (prapanca/戲論).\n\n  **Yogacara parallel**: Three-nature framework (**trisvabhava**/三性) maps more naturally:\n  - **Parikalpita** (遍計所執性, imagined): ≈ aspects of 第二實在 with no phenomenal basis\n  - **Paratantra** (依他起性, dependent): ≈ 第一實在 as dependently arisen flow\n  - **Parinispanna** (圓成實性, consummate): ≈ 第〇實在, except this IS accessible through transformed consciousness (轉識成智)\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"Reality\" with capital R for 實在 when part of author's three-level system. Always include ordinal: \"First Reality,\" \"Second Reality,\" \"Zeroth Reality.\" Note these are epistemic-structural levels, not degrees of ontological realness.\n\n---\n\n## 超越\n\n- **Main translation**: \"transcendence\" (noun), \"transcend\" (verb)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"go beyond\" (verb, discursive)\n  - \"surpass\" when emphasizing overcoming\n- **Note**: The author uses 超越 in specific technical sense: what lies beyond the bounds of a given 境界 (domain/bounds). From 范畴论与境:\n\n  > \"The transcendent (超越) is what exists. Even though any research object we propose must necessarily be within the bounds of thought (思想的境界), its material—'from WHERE do we propose these things?'—is given beforehand (此在, Dasein).\"\n\n  This is NOT metaphysical transcendence (Platonic forms, God, noumena) but phenomenological givenness. Heidegger's **Dasein** (此在, being-there) resonance is explicit. Transcendence is:\n  1. The process of \"putting into the basket\" (what makes phenomena appear)\n  2. Inaccessible DIRECTLY (beyond thought's bounds)\n  3. Studied through its RESULT (phenomena) and EVOLUTION (change in phenomena)\n\n  **Buddhist parallel**: This resembles but differs from discussion of what lies beyond conceptual elaboration (prapanca/戲論):\n  - **Buddhist transcendence**: Liberation (nirvana) transcends samsara, yet MMK 25.19-20 states they are \"not different\"\n  - **Author's transcendence**: The process by which phenomena arise for consciousness—studied through evolution functors, not mystical realization\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"transcendence\" (noun) and \"transcend\" (verb) for 超越. Add note distinguishing from metaphysical/theological transcendence. Author's usage is phenomenological—what lies beyond thought's current bounds but manifests through change.\n\n---\n\n## 诗意\n\n- **Main translation**: \"poeticality\" (noun), \"poetic\" (adjective)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the poetic stance\" when emphasizing orientation\n  - \"poetic engagement\" when emphasizing activity\n- **Note**: The author's original contribution. 诗意 (shi yi) = poetry-meaning/intent. The author defines this as the stance of **清醒的梦境** (lucid dreamscape):\n\n  > \"After metaphysics, facing meaning should be poetic (诗意). Because feeling already exists, we should not deny this meaning (such denial is false pride). Because Zeroth Reality has been disenchanted, we cannot be intoxicated within it. What remains is only to treat it as it is—that is, lucidly. This is the lucid dreamscape, which I call poeticality.\"\n\n  This is the author's term for post-metaphysical engagement: knowing constructions are constructions, yet fully engaging with them.\n\n  **Buddhist parallel**: While Buddhist terminology centers on **upaya** (方便, skillful means) and **karuna** (慈悲, compassion) as post-awakening stances, the author articulates the post-metaphysical stance as POETIC—creative, intentional engagement with constructed meaning. This is a genuinely novel articulation, not found in Buddhist sources.\n\n  **Contrast**:\n  - **沉醉** (intoxicated): pre-metaphysical/pre-awakening belief\n  - **虚无** (nihilistic void): post-metaphysical collapse without reconstruction\n  - **诗意** (poetic): post-metaphysical lucid engagement—the third way\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"poeticality\" (noun) or \"poetic\" (adjective) for 诗意. This is technical term in the author's framework. Avoid \"poetry\" (too narrow—not about verse) and \"aesthetic\" (too broad—not just beauty). \"Poetic\" captures: (1) creative construction, (2) self-aware artifice, (3) full emotional engagement, (4) meaningful despite constructed nature.\n\n---\n\n## 德\n\n- **Main translation**: \"virtue\" (moral contexts), \"potency\" or \"efficacy\" (Daoist contexts)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"de\" (untranslated) when specifically referencing Daoist technical term\n  - \"power\" when emphasizing effective capacity\n- **Note**: 德 (de) is complex term with different meanings in Confucian vs. Daoist traditions:\n\n  **Confucian 德**: Moral virtue, cultivated character (仁義禮智 are aspects of 德)\n\n  **Daoist 德**:\n  - In **Laozi**: The manifestation/function of Dao (道). \"Dao generates, De nurtures\" (道生之，德畜之)\n  - Not moral virtue but natural efficacy, the power/potency by which things are what they are\n  - Author's example: \"What makes a human human\" = 人德 (human-de)\n\n  **Author's usage**: In discussing the 道德仁義禮 hierarchy, the author uses 德 in Daoist sense—the \"operating principle\" of a category of things. 人德 (human-de) = what makes humans function as humans = 仁 (ren, humaneness).\n\n  **Buddhist parallel**: While Buddhism lacks direct equivalent, **svabhava** (自性, self-nature) serves similar role—what makes X be X. But Madhyamaka REJECTS svabhava; the author's 德 is relational/functional, not essential, so closer to Buddhist rejection of svabhava.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Context-dependent:\n  - Confucian moral contexts: \"virtue\"\n  - Daoist cosmological contexts: \"potency\" or \"efficacy\"\n  - Author's usage in 道德仁義禮 example: \"efficacy\" or leave as \"de\" with note\n  - Avoid \"power\" (too political) in most contexts\n\n---\n\n## 道\n\n- **Main translation**: \"Dao\" (untranslated with note)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the Way\" (traditional translation)\n  - \"the Dao\" (with definite article)\n- **Note**: 道 (dao) is central concept in Daoist philosophy, extremely difficult to translate:\n\n  **Laozi's Daodejing opening**: \"The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao\" (道可道，非常道)\n\n  **Traditional meanings**:\n  - Literally: road, path, way\n  - Philosophically: the source/pattern of all things, the ultimate principle, the nameless origin\n\n  **Author's analysis**: In discussing 失道而后德 (lose Dao, then De), the author shows how 道 is:\n  1. Formally positioned as \"most above\" (形而上) in traditional metaphysics\n  2. Actually GENERATED from below (from phenomena upward through abstraction)\n  3. The author's footnote: \"道 is like the canvas for a painting\"—what allows existence to exist\n\n  This parallels the author's 第〇實在 (Zeroth Reality): when articulated, it becomes 第二實在 (construction). True Dao is unspeakable (不可道).\n\n  **Buddhist parallel**:\n  - Similar to dharma-kaya (法身, Dharma-body) or tathata (真如, suchness)—ultimate reality beyond conceptualization\n  - But Buddhism emphasizes THIS is accessible through non-conceptual wisdom; author emphasizes inaccessibility through articulation\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Leave as \"Dao\" (untranslated) with note explaining concept. \"The Way\" is acceptable but less precise. Capitalize to indicate technical term. When discussing author's analysis of 道德仁義禮, explain the formal/generative reversal rather than trying to capture 道 in single English word.\n\n---\n\n## 形而上\n\n- **Main translation**: \"the metaphysical\" (as category of content)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"that which is above form\" (literal, for emphasis)\n  - \"metaphysical constructions\" when emphasizing constructed nature\n- **Note**: **Critical distinction** from 形而上學 (metaphysics as discipline):\n\n  **形而上** (xing er shang) = the metaphysical, that which is above form\n  - Source: Yijing (易經) Xi Ci Zhuan: \"That which is above form is called Dao; that which is below form is called vessel/tool (器)\"\n  - Author's usage: Any interpretive structure built upon phenomena (形/現象)\n  - Examples: concepts, categories, theories, value systems—all 第二實在 (Second Reality)\n\n  **形而上學** (xing er shang xue) = metaphysics, the study of the metaphysical\n  - Translation of \"metaphysics\"\n  - The discipline/inquiry into ultimate reality, first principles\n\n  **Author's framework**:\n  - **前形而上學** (pre-metaphysics): treats 第〇實在 as actually existent foundation\n  - **虚無** (nihilistic void): after metaphysics collapses\n  - **后形而上學** (post-metaphysics): recognizes all 形而上 are constructions upon phenomena, yet functional and necessary\n\n  **Translation rationale**:\n  - 形而上 → \"the metaphysical\" (note: as category, not discipline)\n  - 形而上學 → \"metaphysics\" (the discipline)\n  - Add note explaining literal meaning (\"above form\") and that author treats phenomena (形) as ground, reversing traditional \"Dao generates form\" model\n  - When distinction is unclear, use context: \"metaphysical [constructions/concepts]\" vs. \"metaphysics [as inquiry]\"\n\n---\n\n## 非理性\n\n- **Main translation**: \"non-rational\"\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"arational\" when emphasizing neither rational nor irrational\n  - \"beyond reason\" (discursive)\n- **Note**: The author's crucial move in post-metaphysics:\n\n  > \"Obviously, the purpose of reason must lie outside reason... Therefore, the purpose of reason must be non-rational—that is to say, reason exists merely as a tool. Therefore, we naturally know that **the pursuit of ultimate reality itself is non-rational** (metaphysics itself is non-rational).\"\n\n  And critically:\n\n  > \"The reason metaphysics and nihilism are non-rational is because our **pursuit** of the metaphysical is non-rational... This non-rationality should be **acknowledged** (承認).\"\n\n  **Not irrationality** (against reason) but **non-rationality** (outside reason's scope). The pursuit of constancy, meaning, purpose is not rationally justified but is irreducible feature of human existence.\n\n  **Buddhist parallel**: Buddhism identifies **tanha** (渴愛, craving) as root of suffering—an affective-volitional force, not rational choice. However:\n  - **Buddhism**: Aims to OVERCOME tanha through path (cessation)\n  - **Author**: Aims to RECOGNIZE non-rational drives and work with them lucidly (poeticality)\n\n  Different soteriological orientation: author proposes \"lucid constancy-seeking\" rather than \"cessation of constancy-seeking.\"\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"non-rational\" (not \"irrational\"). \"Irrational\" implies deficiency or pathology; \"non-rational\" indicates outside reason's domain. Avoid \"a-rational\" (too technical). When discussing Buddhism, note Buddhism treats similar drives (tanha, upadana/執取) as to be overcome, while author treats as to be recognized and engaged lucidly.\n\n---\n\n## 承认\n\n- **Main translation**: \"recognize,\" \"acknowledge\"\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"admit\" when emphasizing acceptance of difficult truth\n  - \"acknowledgment\" (noun)\n- **Note**: 承認 (cheng ren) = bear-recognize, acknowledge. This is KEY TERM in author's post-metaphysics:\n\n  > \"This non-rationality should be **acknowledged** (承認).\"\n  >\n  > \"Because feeling already exists, we should not deny this meaning (such denial is false pride虛妄).\"\n\n  Acknowledgment (承認) is the pivot from nihilism to poeticality:\n  1. Acknowledge non-rationality of meaning-seeking\n  2. Acknowledge feelings/meanings already exist (before we can choose)\n  3. Acknowledge constructions are constructions\n  4. Engage lucidly rather than denying or being intoxicated\n\n  **Buddhist parallel**: Similar to **yatha-bhuta** (如實, as it really is) knowledge in Buddhism—seeing things as they are. But:\n  - **Buddhist 如實知**: Seeing impermanence, suffering, non-self as they are → liberation\n  - **Author's 承認**: Recognizing non-rationality, constructedness, inescapability → lucid engagement\n\n  Different endpoints: liberation vs. poetic engagement.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"acknowledge\" or \"recognize\" for 承認. \"Acknowledge\" better captures the acceptance dimension (not just knowing but accepting). Avoid \"accept\" alone (too passive), \"confess\" (too religious), \"recognize\" alone (too neutral).\n\n---\n\n## 第〇实在 / 第一实在 / 第二实在\n\n- **Main translation**:\n  - 第〇實在 = \"Zeroth Reality\"\n  - 第一實在 = \"First Reality\"\n  - 第二實在 = \"Second Reality\"\n- **Alternatives**: None—maintain the numbering system\n- **Note**: See extensive discussion under **實在** above. Key points:\n\n  **Numbering is epistemic-structural, NOT ontological**:\n  - NOT \"degrees of realness\"\n  - Indicates: accessibility, constructedness, epistemic priority\n\n  **First Reality** (第一實在) = phenomena:\n  - Epistemologically prior (cannot be doubted without losing ground)\n  - Given before interpretation\n  - The basis for all constructions\n\n  **Second Reality** (第二實在) = constructions:\n  - Interpretations, models, concepts built on phenomena\n  - Includes \"objective world\" as model\n  - All metaphysical structures\n\n  **Zeroth Reality** (第〇實在) = putative ultimate:\n  - Would be \"behind\" or \"before\" phenomena\n  - Author's claim: In principle inaccessible—articulation makes it Second Reality\n  - Parallel to Kant's noumenon, Laozi's unspoken Dao\n\n  **Translation rationale**:\n  - Always translate with full phrase: \"First Reality\" (not \"first reality\" or \"the first reality\")\n  - Capitalize Reality to indicate technical term\n  - Include translator's note on first occurrence explaining the numbering is NOT ontological hierarchy\n  - The zero/first/second order is counterintuitive (zero comes after first epistemically) but matches author's mathematical thinking (0-indexed, like programming)\n\n---\n\n## Additional Notes on Translation Strategy\n\n### Sanskrit → Chinese → English Chains\n\nWhen Buddhist terms appear in comparative/explanatory contexts, include the full chain:\n\n**Example**: \"The author's rejection of internal essences parallels the Madhyamaka rejection of **svabhava** (Sanskrit स्वभाव → Chinese 自性 → 'self-nature' or 'inherent existence').\"\n\nKey chains to maintain:\n- **pratityasamutpada** (प्रतीत्यसमुत्पाद) → 緣起 → dependent origination\n- **śūnyatā** (शून्यता) → 空 → emptiness\n- **anatman** (अनात्मन्) → 無我 → non-self\n- **bodhi** (बोधि) → 覺 → awakening\n- **vedana** (वेदना) → 受 → feeling\n\n### Kumarajiva vs. Xuanzang Translation Traditions\n\nNote major differences when relevant:\n\n- **Kumarajiva** (鳩摩羅什, 344-413): Emphasized literary elegance, sometimes free translation, introduced 空 for śūnyatā\n- **Xuanzang** (玄奘, 602-664): Emphasized precision, more literal, established Yogacara terminology\n\nWhen author's usage echoes one tradition, note it (e.g., author's 境 usage closer to Kumarajiva's visaya rendering).\n\n### The Author's Usage vs. Buddhist Technical Meanings\n\nALWAYS distinguish when terms have Buddhist technical meanings:\n\n**Pattern**: \"[Author's term] resonates with Buddhist [technical term], but [key difference].\"\n\n**Example**: \"清醒的梦境 (lucid dreamscape) parallels Chan awakening, but where Buddhist 覺 aims at liberation from suffering (dukkha-nirodha), the author's 清醒 is epistemological recognition of constructedness without soteriological goal.\"\n\n### Terms to Keep Untranslated\n\nConsider keeping untranslated (with note) when:\n- No adequate English equivalent exists (Dao, dharma in specialized contexts)\n- Buddhist technical precision is critical (bodhi, pratityasamutpada in scholarly contexts)\n- Author deliberately uses as technical term (境 as \"E\" in formal passages)\n\n### Translator's Notes\n\nEssential translator's notes on first occurrence:\n\n1. **境 (E/Scape)**: Buddhist background (visaya/gocara), why \"realm\" insufficient, author's categorical formalization\n2. **虚无 vs. 空**: Critical distinction between author's nihilism and Buddhist emptiness\n3. **清醒的梦境**: Parallel to Chan awakening, but different soteriology\n4. **第〇/第一/第二實在**: Numbering is epistemic, not ontological; relationship to Buddhist two truths\n5. **诗意**: Author's original term for post-metaphysical stance\n\n---\n\n## Glossary: Quick Reference\n\n| Chinese | Sanskrit (if applicable) | Primary Translation | Buddhist Connection |\n|---------|-------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| 境 | visaya, gocara | Scape, E | Object-domain of consciousness |\n| 境界 | — | bounds, horizon | Domain-and-limit |\n| 虚无 | — | nihilism, the void | ≠ śūnyatā |\n| 空 | śūnyatā | emptiness | Lack of svabhava |\n| 清醒 | bodhi (parallel) | lucid | ≈ awakening |\n| 沉醉 | mada (parallel) | intoxicated | ≈ delusion |\n| 梦境 | svapna (analogy) | dreamscape | Like-a-dream |\n| 觉/悟 | bodhi/prajna | awakening/realization | Enlightenment |\n| 恒常 | nitya (opposite) | constancy | ≠ impermanence |\n| 无常 | anitya | impermanence | Three marks |\n| 我 | atman (rejected) | I, self | To be analyzed |\n| 无我 | anatman | non-self | No inherent self |\n| 感受 | vedana | feeling, experience | One of five aggregates |\n| 现象 | dhamma/dharma | phenomena | Given experience |\n| 缘起 | pratityasamutpada | dependent origination | Core teaching |\n| 自性 | svabhava | self-nature | To be rejected |\n| 实在 | — | Reality | Epistemic levels |\n| 超越 | — | transcendence | Beyond bounds |\n| 诗意 | — | poeticality | Author's original |\n| 德 | — | virtue, efficacy | Confucian/Daoist |\n| 道 | — | Dao | Ultimate principle |\n| 形而上 | — | the metaphysical | Above form |\n| 非理性 | — | non-rational | Outside reason |\n| 承认 | — | acknowledge | Pivotal recognition |\n\n---\n\n**End of Dictionary**\n\n**Prepared by:** Buddhism (Madhyamaka/Yogacara/Chan-Zen) Specialist\n**Date:** 2026-02-10\n**For:** jing-translation team\n\nThis dictionary should be used alongside the Analysis Report for comprehensive understanding of Buddhist philosophical dimensions in the 境集 collection.\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":39518,"cache_read_input_tokens":11109,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":39518},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CXzp3aFMnn5imYUHDHEAF","type":"assistant","uuid":"d2836702-dd73-41bb-a36d-526503382c9e","timestamp":"2026-02-10T17:55:21.485Z"}

In Chinese Buddhist translation:\n  - **Kumarajiva** used 境 to translate visaya in Yogacara texts, meaning \"object-domain of consciousness\"\n  - **Xuanzang** used 境界 for gocara in Vijnaptimatratasiddhi (成唯識論), meaning \"range of activity\"\n  - Traditional usage: 境 is what consciousness takes as its object, NOT an independent external world\n\n  **Author's transformation**: The author preserves the Buddhist insight that 境 is structured by mind, not \"the world out there,\" but adds unprecedented formal precision through category theory. The author's E is simultaneously: (1) the experiential field (Buddhist visaya), (2) the structure imposed on that field (Yogacara vijnapti-structuring), and (3) a categorical system with tower structure that can be formally analyzed. This is NOT a departure from Buddhist meaning but a mathematical formalization of it.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: \"Realm\" loses the Buddhist resonance and implies ontological independence. \"Sphere\" or \"domain\" are too generic. \"World\" is too ontologically loaded. \"Scape\" (from landscape/dreamscape) preserves the phenomenological (what appears), structured (shaped by mind), and bounded (limited range) dimensions. Use \"E\" in technical passages to maintain the author's formal notation.\n\n---\n\n## 境界\n\n- **Main translation**: \"bounds,\" \"horizon,\" \"domain-and-limit\"\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"experiential boundary\" when emphasizing delimitation\n  - \"level of attainment\" when the Buddhist resonance of spiritual progress is relevant\n- **Note**: In Buddhist usage, 境界 carries two overlapping meanings:\n  - **Spatial sense**: the boundary or extent of a domain (e.g., 語言的境界 = the bounds of language)\n  - **Soteriological sense**: level of spiritual attainment (e.g., 菩薩境界 = the level/state of a bodhisattva)\n\n  The author uses primarily the first sense, but the second sense creates resonance when discussing \"清醒的梦境\" (lucid dreamscape) as a transformed state of awareness. The term implies both \"where this domain reaches\" and \"what can be reached within this domain.\"\n\n  **Translation rationale**: \"Bounds\" captures both meanings—spatial limits and accessible range. Avoid \"boundary\" alone (too rigid), \"limit\" alone (too restrictive), \"scope\" (too academic/neutral).\n\n---\n\n## 虚无 / 虚無主義\n\n- **Main translation**: \"nihilism\" (虚無主義), \"the void\" or \"emptiness-as-absence\" (虚无)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the vacancy\" or \"the absence\" when emphasizing lack\n  - \"nothingness\" when existentialist resonance is appropriate\n- **Note**: **CRITICAL DISTINCTION** from Buddhist 空 (śūnyatā/sunyata):\n\n  **Buddhist 空 (śūnyatā)**: NOT nihilism (断見, uccheda-vada). In Madhyamaka, emptiness (空) means absence of **svabhava** (自性, inherent existence), NOT absence of phenomena. Nagarjuna's MMK 24.18: \"Whatever is dependently originated, that we call emptiness.\" Emptiness is the Middle Way between eternalism and nihilism.\n\n  **Kumarajiva's translation strategy**: Used 空 (empty) rather than 無 (non-being) to avoid confusion with nihilism. The Chinese character 無 (wu) suggests absolute non-existence; 空 (kong) suggests empty-of-something (empty of svabhava).\n\n  **Author's 虚无**: The void LEFT AFTER metaphysics collapses. The author explicitly states: \"Nihilism is not a being, not a doctrine (主义), but an absence, a vacancy (缺位)... nothing is being produced or created anymore.\" This IS the nihilistic extreme (断邊) that Madhyamaka warns against. However, the author does NOT remain here—post-metaphysics is the exit from this void, parallel to the Middle Way.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Translate 虚无主義 as \"nihilism\" but ALWAYS include translator's note distinguishing from Buddhist emptiness (空). When 虚无 appears alone, consider \"the void\" or \"nihilistic vacancy\" to emphasize the negative, absence-character. Never translate 虚无 as \"emptiness\" (which should be reserved for 空/śūnyatā).\n\n---\n\n## 空\n\n- **Main translation**: \"emptiness\" (when referring to Buddhist śūnyatā), \"empty\" (adjectival)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"void\" only when clearly distinguished from 虚无\n  - \"vacuity\" in philosophical contexts requiring precision\n- **Note**: This term appears rarely in the author's text, but when it does, it carries Buddhist technical meaning:\n\n  **Sanskrit śūnyatā → Chinese 空**: The central concept of Madhyamaka philosophy. Emptiness of svabhava (inherent existence), NOT emptiness of existence. The Diamond Sutra (金剛經): \"All conditioned phenomena are like a dream, an illusion\" (一切有為法，如夢幻泡影) describes emptiness, not non-existence.\n\n  **Author's minimal usage**: In the example \"when we strip away our characteristics... we eventually arrive at 'emptiness' (空),\" the author acknowledges this is the WRONG approach (choosing containment relations on physical objects rather than phenomena as P). The author's framework avoids reifying 空 as a metaphysical ultimate, which aligns with Madhyamaka's rejection of 空 itself as a view to be grasped.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"emptiness\" for 空 when Buddhist resonance is clear. Never conflate with 虚无. If both terms appear in proximity, use \"emptiness\" (空) vs. \"the void/nihilism\" (虚无) to maintain distinction.\n\n---\n\n## 清醒\n\n- **Main translation**: \"lucid\" (清醒的梦境 = lucid dreamscape)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"wakeful\" or \"clear-seeing\" in non-dreamscape contexts\n  - \"aware\" when emphasizing consciousness without Buddhist overtones\n- **Note**: 清醒 literally means \"clear-awake\" and carries overtones of Buddhist **bodhi** (覺, awakening). In Chinese Buddhist vocabulary:\n  - 覺 (jue): awakening, enlightenment (bodhi)\n  - 覺醒: to awaken (often used for enlightenment experience)\n  - 清醒: everyday term for being awake/sober, but in philosophical context resonates with 覺\n\n  **Author's usage**: \"清醒的梦境\" (lucid dreamscape) describes engagement with meaning-structures WHILE KNOWING they are constructions. This parallels Chan awakening's third stage: \"After enlightenment, mountains are mountains again\" (青原惟信)—return to full engagement with transformed understanding.\n\n  **Difference from Buddhist awakening**: Buddhist 覺 typically implies cessation of fundamental ignorance (avidya/無明). The author's 清醒 is epistemological (knowing the constructedness) rather than soteriological (liberation from suffering). But the structural parallel is profound: both involve seeing-through without disengaging.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: \"Lucid\" captures both \"clear-seeing\" and the dreamscape context (as in \"lucid dreaming\"—knowing you're dreaming while in the dream). Avoid \"awakened\" (too specifically Buddhist) and \"conscious\" (too Cartesian/neutral). \"Wakeful\" is acceptable but less evocative.\n\n---\n\n## 沉醉\n\n- **Main translation**: \"intoxicated\" (沉醉的梦境 = intoxicated dreamscape)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"immersed\" when intoxication metaphor is too strong\n  - \"entranced\" when emphasizing loss of critical awareness\n- **Note**: 沉醉 literally means \"sink-drunk,\" combining submersion (沉) and intoxication (醉). In Buddhist psychology:\n  - **mada** (憍, 醉): intoxication/pride, one of the klesha (煩惱, afflictions)\n  - **moha** (癡): delusion, fundamental ignorance\n\n  **Author's usage**: \"沉醉的梦境\" describes engagement WITHOUT awareness that meaning-structures are constructions. This is faith/belief (信念/信仰) where purpose appears logically groundless but historically conditioned. The metaphor: drunk on the dream, unaware it's a dream.\n\n  **Buddhist parallel**: Corresponds to pre-awakening state, where one takes conceptual constructions (prapanca/戲論) as ultimately real. The intoxication metaphor recalls Buddhist warnings against the \"intoxicants\" (madya/酒) that cloud discernment.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: \"Intoxicated\" preserves the Buddhist resonance of clouded awareness (mada) and the author's metaphor of being \"drunk\" on meaning. Avoid \"unconscious\" (too negative) and \"naive\" (too judgmental). \"Immersed\" is acceptable but loses the critique of clouded judgment.\n\n---\n\n## 梦境\n\n- **Main translation**: \"dreamscape\"\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"dream-realm\" when emphasizing bounded domain\n  - \"dream-construction\" when emphasizing constructed nature\n- **Note**: 梦 (dream) + 境 (scape/domain). The author explicitly distinguishes this from \"illusion to be dispelled\":\n\n  **Buddhist dream analogy**:\n  - **svapna** (夢): standard example of emptiness in Madhyamaka and Yogacara\n  - **Diamond Sutra**: \"All conditioned phenomena are like a dream\" (如夢幻泡影)\n  - **Madhyamaka usage**: Dream objects FUNCTION within the dream even though they lack inherent existence. A dream fire can warm a dream body. This is NOT nihilism—it's the Middle Way.\n\n  **Author's usage**: 梦境 is the \"environment\" (環境) in which meaning and purpose can exist. Games, novels, rituals, lived frameworks—all are dreamscapes. The author emphasizes: \"清醒的梦境 still necessarily means full engagement\" (清醒的梦境依旧也必然意味着对梦境的全身心之投入). This perfectly parallels the Buddhist bodhisattva who saves beings while knowing there are no beings to save (Diamond Sutra).\n\n  **Critical point**: The author's 梦境 is NOT illusion (幻) to be escaped but structure to be engaged with lucidly. This aligns with Madhyamaka's insistence that emptiness doesn't negate function.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: \"Dreamscape\" (not just \"dream\") captures the spatial/environmental dimension and the constructed-yet-immersive quality. Avoid \"illusion\" (implies falsity to be rejected), \"fantasy\" (too escapist), \"construct\" (too abstract/clinical).\n\n---\n\n## 觉 / 悟\n\n- **Main translation**: \"awakening\" (覺), \"realization\" (悟), or \"enlightenment\" (覺悟)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"insight\" for 悟 in non-technical contexts\n  - \"bodhi\" (untranslated) when Sanskrit reference is critical\n- **Note**: These terms appear minimally in the author's text but are essential background:\n\n  **Buddhist technical terms**:\n  - **覺 (jue)**: Sanskrit **bodhi** (बोधि), awakening/enlightenment\n  - **悟 (wu)**: realization, insight (often used in Chan for sudden awakening, Japanese **satori**)\n  - **覺悟**: compound meaning awakening-realization, the process or event of enlightenment\n\n  **Chinese translation history**:\n  - Kumarajiva: used 覺 for bodhi, emphasizing awakening aspect\n  - Xuanzang: used 覺 for bodhi, 悟 for pratipatti (realization through practice)\n  - Chan tradition: 悟 becomes central (頓悟 sudden awakening, 漸悟 gradual awakening)\n\n  **Author's non-usage**: The author avoids these terms, using instead 清醒 (lucid) and 承認 (recognition/acknowledgment). This is deliberate—avoiding Buddhist technical vocabulary while arriving at structurally similar insights. When discussing \"what Chan calls 悟,\" use \"awakening.\"\n\n  **Translation rationale**: When these terms appear in explanatory/comparative contexts (discussing Buddhist parallels), use \"awakening\" (覺) and \"realization\" (悟). Maintain distinction from the author's 清醒 (lucid).\n\n---\n\n## 恒常\n\n- **Main translation**: \"constancy\"\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"permanence\" only when ontological claim is explicit\n  - \"stability\" when emphasizing functional continuity\n- **Note**: 恒常 (heng chang) = enduring-constant. The author identifies this as \"the core of metaphysics\" (形而上学的核心是恒常):\n\n  **Buddhist contrast: anitya** (無常, impermanence):\n  - **Sanskrit anitya → Chinese 無常**: The first of three marks of existence (trilaksana)\n  - **Buddhist teaching**: Taking the impermanent as permanent (於無常執常) is one of the four cognitive inversions (viparyasa/顛倒)\n  - **Satipatthana Sutta**: Observe arising and passing (samudaya-vaya) in all phenomena\n\n  **Author's analysis**: \"We need to find (pursue) a constancy (恒常) within changing phenomena, so that we can intentionally perform any action with results meaningful to us.\" Constancy is a \"guarantee\" (保證) that same phenomena will REPEAT. This pursuit is non-rational but necessary.\n\n  **Key difference**: Buddhism identifies pursuit of permanence as rooted in **avidya** (ignorance/無明) to be OVERCOME. The author identifies pursuit of constancy as non-rational feature to be RECOGNIZED (承認) and worked with lucidly, not eliminated. This is a different soteriological stance—post-metaphysical constancy-seeking rather than cessation of constancy-seeking.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: \"Constancy\" better than \"permanence\" (which sounds like Buddhist 常/nitya as metaphysical claim). The author's 恒常 is about pursuit of repeatability and stability, not assertion of permanent essences. Avoid \"invariance\" (too mathematical) and \"persistence\" (too weak).\n\n---\n\n## 无常\n\n- **Main translation**: \"impermanence\"\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"impermanent\" (adjectival)\n  - \"transience\" when poetic tone is appropriate\n- **Note**: **Buddhist technical term**:\n  - **Sanskrit anitya → Chinese 無常**: Fundamental teaching across all Buddhist schools\n  - **Three marks of existence** (trilaksana/三法印): All conditioned phenomena are impermanent (anicca/無常), suffering (dukkha/苦), non-self (anatta/無我)\n\n  The author's text does not use 无常 frequently, focusing instead on 恒常 (constancy) as the metaphysical drive. The absence is notable—the author approaches from the phenomenology of our pursuit of stability rather than asserting impermanence as ontological truth.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"impermanence\" (noun) or \"impermanent\" (adjective) for 無常 when discussing Buddhist doctrine. Maintain contrast with author's 恒常 (constancy).\n\n---\n\n## 我\n\n- **Main translation**: \"I,\" \"self,\" \"me\" (depending on grammatical context)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the I\" when discussing 我 as concept/object of analysis\n  - \"ego\" only in psychoanalytic contexts (avoid Buddhist conflation)\n- **Note**: The author provides a formal definition: \"'I' is that feeling, the feeling that whenever you mention any aspect related to me, it causes me to associate—that feeling is me.\" Formally: \"I\" is the universal property (terminal object) of a subcategory whose objects are all experiences related to me.\n\n  **Buddhist anatman** (無我, non-self):\n  - **Sanskrit anatman/anatta → Chinese 無我**: No permanent, unchanging, independent self\n  - **Milindapanha's chariot analogy**: \"Self\" is a designation for the five aggregates (skandha/蘊), not a substance\n  - **Nagarjuna (MMK 18)**: The self cannot be found among the aggregates, yet functions as conventional designation\n\n  **Remarkable convergence**: The author's category-theoretic definition—self as structural position (universal property) in network of associations, not substance—IS the Middle Way on self:\n  - NOT eternalism: there IS a \"feeling of I,\" it's experienceable, not nothing\n  - NOT nihilism: no self-substance; \"I\" is terminal object in subcategory, constituted by relations\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"I\" for 我 in most contexts. Use \"the I\" or \"the self\" when 我 is discussed as philosophical concept. Avoid \"ego\" (Freudian baggage) and \"atman\" (Hindu concept that Buddhism rejects).\n\n---\n\n## 无我\n\n- **Main translation**: \"non-self\" (philosophical), \"selflessness\" (ethical)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"no-self\" when emphasizing negation\n  - \"anatman\" (untranslated) when Sanskrit reference is critical\n- **Note**: **Core Buddhist doctrine**:\n  - **Sanskrit anatman → Chinese 無我**: Denial of permanent, unchanging, independent self (atman)\n  - Across all schools: No entity that is permanent (常), unitary (一), independent (自在), controller (主宰)\n\n  The author rarely uses 无我 explicitly, but the category-theoretic definition of 我 (as universal property, not substance) functionally embodies the anatman teaching. The author arrives at non-self through formal analysis rather than Buddhist practice.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"non-self\" for 無我 in Buddhist contexts. The author's framework achieves non-self structurally without using the term.\n\n---\n\n## 感受 / 受\n\n- **Main translation**: \"feeling\" (感受), \"vedana\" or \"feeling-tone\" (受)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"experience\" when broader than affective tone\n  - \"sensation\" when emphasizing sensory origin\n- **Note**: The author uses 感受 extensively as foundational category. In the footnote: \"感受 has two meanings: (1) received information, i.e., stimuli; (2) the 'crystallization,' 'surge,' 'turbulence' that these construct. The second kind is also 感受.\"\n\n  **Buddhist vedana** (受):\n  - **Sanskrit vedana → Chinese 受**: One of five aggregates (skandha/蘊)\n  - **Buddhist definition**: Affective tone (pleasant/unpleasant/neutral) arising from contact (phassa/觸)\n  - **Dependent origination**: Contact → feeling → craving (vedana → tanha)\n  - **Satipatthana**: Mindfulness of feelings (vedananupassana) is crucial practice\n\n  **Author's usage**: 感受 is more comprehensive than Buddhist 受. The author states: \"feelings exist prior to the concept of I\" (感受存在于我的概念之先)—this aligns with Buddhist teaching that vedana is part of five aggregates (including feeling) that PRECEDE any reified self. But the author's 感受 includes what Buddhism would categorize across multiple aggregates (vedana, sañña/想/perception, sankhara/行/volitions).\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Translate 感受 as \"feeling\" or \"experience\" depending on context. When discussing Buddhist parallels, note that author's 感受 is broader than Buddhist vedana (受) but includes it. Use \"feeling\" for both to maintain continuity, with footnotes clarifying scope.\n\n---\n\n## 现象\n\n- **Main translation**: \"phenomena\" (plural), \"phenomenon\" (singular)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"appearance\" when emphasizing how things show up\n  - \"what appears\" (discursive)\n- **Note**: The author defines P (phenomena) as \"第一實在\" (First Reality): what is directly encountered, cannot be doubted. All metaphysical constructions are based ON phenomena.\n\n  **Buddhist dharma** (法):\n  - **Sanskrit dharma → Chinese 法**: Phenomena, elements of existence, experiential constituents\n  - **Pali dhamma**: In Theravada, the ultimate constituents of experience\n  - **Abhidharma**: Catalogs dharmas (mental factors, physical factors, etc.)\n\n  **Key distinction**:\n  - **Buddhist 法/dharma**: Analytical categories of experience (including mental factors)\n  - **Author's 现象/phenomena**: What is given prior to interpretation, closer to Pali **paccakkha** (directly experienced)\n  - **Husserlian phenomenology**: Author's usage has resonances but is distinct—less transcendental ego focus\n\n  **Author's critical move**: Phenomena (第一實在) are epistemologically prior. Any \"objective world\" (客觀世界) is a model GENERATED FROM phenomena (第二實在). This is almost precisely the Yogacara position that 境 is vijnapti-matra (唯識所現, appearance-only).\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"phenomena\" for 现象. Add translator's note distinguishing from Husserlian phenomenology (bracketing, transcendental ego) and from Buddhist dharma (analytical categories). The author's phenomena are the given experiential basis, not analyzable elements or noumena-behind-appearances.\n\n---\n\n## 缘起\n\n- **Main translation**: \"dependent origination\"\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"conditioned arising\" (more literal)\n  - \"interdependent co-arising\" (when emphasizing mutuality)\n- **Note**: **Central Buddhist doctrine**:\n  - **Sanskrit pratityasamutpada → Chinese 緣起**: The teaching that all phenomena arise in dependence on conditions (pratyaya/緣)\n  - **Nagarjuna (MMK 24.18)**: \"Whatever is dependently arisen, that we call emptiness\"\n  - **Formula**: \"When this exists, that comes to be; with the arising of this, that arises\" (此有故彼有，此生故彼生)\n\n  **Author's implicit embodiment**: Though the term 缘起 doesn't appear frequently, the author's CORE MOVE embodies it:\n\n  > \"Rather than exploring 'the essence of things' as an inward direction, a more practical orientation is to explore 'the position of things' as an outward (relational) direction... In practice, the exploration of internal essence is 'impossible' because any exploration of internal essence will ultimately convert into an exploration of its external extensions.\"\n\n  This is FORMAL EXPRESSION of pratityasamutpada: things are constituted by relations, not by svabhava (self-nature). In category theory, objects are defined by morphisms—this is the **Yoneda lemma**, which the author implicitly invokes. Buddhist equivalent: a dharma is constituted entirely by conditions and relations.\n\n  **Hua-yen resonance**: The tower structure (morphisms are themselves objects with morphisms) resonates with Hua-yen (華嚴, Avatamsaka) doctrine of **shishi wuai** (事事無礙, interpenetration). Fa-zang's (法藏) Indra's net metaphor—each jewel reflects all others infinitely—is precisely tower-like.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"dependent origination\" for 緣起. When discussing author's relational/categorical approach, note this is formal expression of dependent origination without using Buddhist terminology.\n\n---\n\n## 自性\n\n- **Main translation**: \"self-nature,\" \"inherent existence\"\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"intrinsic nature\" when emphasizing inherent qualities\n  - \"svabhava\" (untranslated) when Sanskrit reference is critical\n- **Note**: **Key term in Madhyamaka**:\n  - **Sanskrit svabhava → Chinese 自性**: Self-nature, own-being, inherent existence\n  - **Nagarjuna's target**: Svabhava is what Madhyamaka REJECTS. No phenomena have svabhava—all are empty (śūnya) of inherent existence.\n  - **Definition**: Svabhava would be existence that is: (1) not dependent on causes/conditions, (2) unchanging, (3) not dependent on conceptual imputation\n\n  **Author's parallel**: The author rejects \"internal essences\" in favor of relational definition. This recapitulates the Buddhist rejection of svabhava WITHOUT using the term. From 范畴论与境:\n\n  > \"Any exploration of internal essence will ultimately convert into an exploration of its external extensions.\"\n\n  Category theory: objects are defined by morphisms (external relations), not internal content. Two objects are \"the same\" (isomorphic) iff they have same morphisms to/from all other objects. This IS the rejection of svabhava—essence is relational, not intrinsic.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"self-nature\" or \"inherent existence\" for 自性 in Buddhist contexts. When discussing the author's rejection of internal essence, note this parallels rejection of svabhava but uses category-theoretic rather than Buddhist language.\n\n---\n\n## 实在\n\n- **Main translation**: \"reality\" (with ordinal prefix when specified: 第一實在 = First Reality)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"what is real\" (discursive)\n  - \"the real\" (when discussing as philosophical category)\n- **Note**: The author's three-level framework:\n  - **第一實在** (First Reality): phenomena as directly encountered. Cannot be doubted. Starting point.\n  - **第二實在** (Second Reality): interpretations, models, concepts built upon phenomena. The \"objective world.\" All metaphysical constructions.\n  - **第〇實在** (Zeroth Reality): putative \"ultimate reality\" behind phenomena. Author's claim: \"When we propose 第〇實在, the very thing we propose BECOMES 第二實在.\"\n\n  **Buddhist two truths** (二諦):\n  - **Samvrti-satya** (世俗諦, conventional truth): ordinary language, concepts, practical engagement\n  - **Paramartha-satya** (勝義諦, ultimate truth): emptiness, absence of inherent existence\n\n  **Comparison**:\n  - Author's 第一實在 (phenomena) = basis for both Buddhist truths, not itself either truth\n  - Author's 第二實在 (constructions) ≈ samvrti-satya (conventional truth)\n  - Author's 第〇實在 (inaccessible ultimate) ≠ paramartha-satya (which IS accessible in Madhyamaka through prajna)\n\n  **Critical divergence**: Madhyamaka's paramartha is NOT behind or below conventional—it IS the emptiness OF the conventional. Accessed not by going elsewhere but seeing THIS differently. Author's 第〇實在 is IN PRINCIPLE inaccessible (closer to Kant's noumenon). However, author's REASON for inaccessibility (articulation is already construction) resonates with Nagarjuna's teaching that ultimate truth transcends conceptual proliferation (prapanca/戲論).\n\n  **Yogacara parallel**: Three-nature framework (**trisvabhava**/三性) maps more naturally:\n  - **Parikalpita** (遍計所執性, imagined): ≈ aspects of 第二實在 with no phenomenal basis\n  - **Paratantra** (依他起性, dependent): ≈ 第一實在 as dependently arisen flow\n  - **Parinispanna** (圓成實性, consummate): ≈ 第〇實在, except this IS accessible through transformed consciousness (轉識成智)\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"Reality\" with capital R for 實在 when part of author's three-level system. Always include ordinal: \"First Reality,\" \"Second Reality,\" \"Zeroth Reality.\" Note these are epistemic-structural levels, not degrees of ontological realness.\n\n---\n\n## 超越\n\n- **Main translation**: \"transcendence\" (noun), \"transcend\" (verb)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"go beyond\" (verb, discursive)\n  - \"surpass\" when emphasizing overcoming\n- **Note**: The author uses 超越 in specific technical sense: what lies beyond the bounds of a given 境界 (domain/bounds). From 范畴论与境:\n\n  > \"The transcendent (超越) is what exists. Even though any research object we propose must necessarily be within the bounds of thought (思想的境界), its material—'from WHERE do we propose these things?'—is given beforehand (此在, Dasein).\"\n\n  This is NOT metaphysical transcendence (Platonic forms, God, noumena) but phenomenological givenness. Heidegger's **Dasein** (此在, being-there) resonance is explicit. Transcendence is:\n  1. The process of \"putting into the basket\" (what makes phenomena appear)\n  2. Inaccessible DIRECTLY (beyond thought's bounds)\n  3. Studied through its RESULT (phenomena) and EVOLUTION (change in phenomena)\n\n  **Buddhist parallel**: This resembles but differs from discussion of what lies beyond conceptual elaboration (prapanca/戲論):\n  - **Buddhist transcendence**: Liberation (nirvana) transcends samsara, yet MMK 25.19-20 states they are \"not different\"\n  - **Author's transcendence**: The process by which phenomena arise for consciousness—studied through evolution functors, not mystical realization\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"transcendence\" (noun) and \"transcend\" (verb) for 超越. Add note distinguishing from metaphysical/theological transcendence. Author's usage is phenomenological—what lies beyond thought's current bounds but manifests through change.\n\n---\n\n## 诗意\n\n- **Main translation**: \"poeticality\" (noun), \"poetic\" (adjective)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the poetic stance\" when emphasizing orientation\n  - \"poetic engagement\" when emphasizing activity\n- **Note**: The author's original contribution. 诗意 (shi yi) = poetry-meaning/intent. The author defines this as the stance of **清醒的梦境** (lucid dreamscape):\n\n  > \"After metaphysics, facing meaning should be poetic (诗意). Because feeling already exists, we should not deny this meaning (such denial is false pride). Because Zeroth Reality has been disenchanted, we cannot be intoxicated within it. What remains is only to treat it as it is—that is, lucidly. This is the lucid dreamscape, which I call poeticality.\"\n\n  This is the author's term for post-metaphysical engagement: knowing constructions are constructions, yet fully engaging with them.\n\n  **Buddhist parallel**: While Buddhist terminology centers on **upaya** (方便, skillful means) and **karuna** (慈悲, compassion) as post-awakening stances, the author articulates the post-metaphysical stance as POETIC—creative, intentional engagement with constructed meaning. This is a genuinely novel articulation, not found in Buddhist sources.\n\n  **Contrast**:\n  - **沉醉** (intoxicated): pre-metaphysical/pre-awakening belief\n  - **虚无** (nihilistic void): post-metaphysical collapse without reconstruction\n  - **诗意** (poetic): post-metaphysical lucid engagement—the third way\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"poeticality\" (noun) or \"poetic\" (adjective) for 诗意. This is technical term in the author's framework. Avoid \"poetry\" (too narrow—not about verse) and \"aesthetic\" (too broad—not just beauty). \"Poetic\" captures: (1) creative construction, (2) self-aware artifice, (3) full emotional engagement, (4) meaningful despite constructed nature.\n\n---\n\n## 德\n\n- **Main translation**: \"virtue\" (moral contexts), \"potency\" or \"efficacy\" (Daoist contexts)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"de\" (untranslated) when specifically referencing Daoist technical term\n  - \"power\" when emphasizing effective capacity\n- **Note**: 德 (de) is complex term with different meanings in Confucian vs. Daoist traditions:\n\n  **Confucian 德**: Moral virtue, cultivated character (仁義禮智 are aspects of 德)\n\n  **Daoist 德**:\n  - In **Laozi**: The manifestation/function of Dao (道). \"Dao generates, De nurtures\" (道生之，德畜之)\n  - Not moral virtue but natural efficacy, the power/potency by which things are what they are\n  - Author's example: \"What makes a human human\" = 人德 (human-de)\n\n  **Author's usage**: In discussing the 道德仁義禮 hierarchy, the author uses 德 in Daoist sense—the \"operating principle\" of a category of things. 人德 (human-de) = what makes humans function as humans = 仁 (ren, humaneness).\n\n  **Buddhist parallel**: While Buddhism lacks direct equivalent, **svabhava** (自性, self-nature) serves similar role—what makes X be X. But Madhyamaka REJECTS svabhava; the author's 德 is relational/functional, not essential, so closer to Buddhist rejection of svabhava.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Context-dependent:\n  - Confucian moral contexts: \"virtue\"\n  - Daoist cosmological contexts: \"potency\" or \"efficacy\"\n  - Author's usage in 道德仁義禮 example: \"efficacy\" or leave as \"de\" with note\n  - Avoid \"power\" (too political) in most contexts\n\n---\n\n## 道\n\n- **Main translation**: \"Dao\" (untranslated with note)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the Way\" (traditional translation)\n  - \"the Dao\" (with definite article)\n- **Note**: 道 (dao) is central concept in Daoist philosophy, extremely difficult to translate:\n\n  **Laozi's Daodejing opening**: \"The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao\" (道可道，非常道)\n\n  **Traditional meanings**:\n  - Literally: road, path, way\n  - Philosophically: the source/pattern of all things, the ultimate principle, the nameless origin\n\n  **Author's analysis**: In discussing 失道而后德 (lose Dao, then De), the author shows how 道 is:\n  1. Formally positioned as \"most above\" (形而上) in traditional metaphysics\n  2. Actually GENERATED from below (from phenomena upward through abstraction)\n  3. The author's footnote: \"道 is like the canvas for a painting\"—what allows existence to exist\n\n  This parallels the author's 第〇實在 (Zeroth Reality): when articulated, it becomes 第二實在 (construction). True Dao is unspeakable (不可道).\n\n  **Buddhist parallel**:\n  - Similar to dharma-kaya (法身, Dharma-body) or tathata (真如, suchness)—ultimate reality beyond conceptualization\n  - But Buddhism emphasizes THIS is accessible through non-conceptual wisdom; author emphasizes inaccessibility through articulation\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Leave as \"Dao\" (untranslated) with note explaining concept. \"The Way\" is acceptable but less precise. Capitalize to indicate technical term. When discussing author's analysis of 道德仁義禮, explain the formal/generative reversal rather than trying to capture 道 in single English word.\n\n---\n\n## 形而上\n\n- **Main translation**: \"the metaphysical\" (as category of content)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"that which is above form\" (literal, for emphasis)\n  - \"metaphysical constructions\" when emphasizing constructed nature\n- **Note**: **Critical distinction** from 形而上學 (metaphysics as discipline):\n\n  **形而上** (xing er shang) = the metaphysical, that which is above form\n  - Source: Yijing (易經) Xi Ci Zhuan: \"That which is above form is called Dao; that which is below form is called vessel/tool (器)\"\n  - Author's usage: Any interpretive structure built upon phenomena (形/現象)\n  - Examples: concepts, categories, theories, value systems—all 第二實在 (Second Reality)\n\n  **形而上學** (xing er shang xue) = metaphysics, the study of the metaphysical\n  - Translation of \"metaphysics\"\n  - The discipline/inquiry into ultimate reality, first principles\n\n  **Author's framework**:\n  - **前形而上學** (pre-metaphysics): treats 第〇實在 as actually existent foundation\n  - **虚無** (nihilistic void): after metaphysics collapses\n  - **后形而上學** (post-metaphysics): recognizes all 形而上 are constructions upon phenomena, yet functional and necessary\n\n  **Translation rationale**:\n  - 形而上 → \"the metaphysical\" (note: as category, not discipline)\n  - 形而上學 → \"metaphysics\" (the discipline)\n  - Add note explaining literal meaning (\"above form\") and that author treats phenomena (形) as ground, reversing traditional \"Dao generates form\" model\n  - When distinction is unclear, use context: \"metaphysical [constructions/concepts]\" vs. \"metaphysics [as inquiry]\"\n\n---\n\n## 非理性\n\n- **Main translation**: \"non-rational\"\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"arational\" when emphasizing neither rational nor irrational\n  - \"beyond reason\" (discursive)\n- **Note**: The author's crucial move in post-metaphysics:\n\n  > \"Obviously, the purpose of reason must lie outside reason... Therefore, the purpose of reason must be non-rational—that is to say, reason exists merely as a tool. Therefore, we naturally know that **the pursuit of ultimate reality itself is non-rational** (metaphysics itself is non-rational).\"\n\n  And critically:\n\n  > \"The reason metaphysics and nihilism are non-rational is because our **pursuit** of the metaphysical is non-rational... This non-rationality should be **acknowledged** (承認).\"\n\n  **Not irrationality** (against reason) but **non-rationality** (outside reason's scope). The pursuit of constancy, meaning, purpose is not rationally justified but is irreducible feature of human existence.\n\n  **Buddhist parallel**: Buddhism identifies **tanha** (渴愛, craving) as root of suffering—an affective-volitional force, not rational choice. However:\n  - **Buddhism**: Aims to OVERCOME tanha through path (cessation)\n  - **Author**: Aims to RECOGNIZE non-rational drives and work with them lucidly (poeticality)\n\n  Different soteriological orientation: author proposes \"lucid constancy-seeking\" rather than \"cessation of constancy-seeking.\"\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"non-rational\" (not \"irrational\"). \"Irrational\" implies deficiency or pathology; \"non-rational\" indicates outside reason's domain. Avoid \"a-rational\" (too technical). When discussing Buddhism, note Buddhism treats similar drives (tanha, upadana/執取) as to be overcome, while author treats as to be recognized and engaged lucidly.\n\n---\n\n## 承认\n\n- **Main translation**: \"recognize,\" \"acknowledge\"\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"admit\" when emphasizing acceptance of difficult truth\n  - \"acknowledgment\" (noun)\n- **Note**: 承認 (cheng ren) = bear-recognize, acknowledge. This is KEY TERM in author's post-metaphysics:\n\n  > \"This non-rationality should be **acknowledged** (承認).\"\n  >\n  > \"Because feeling already exists, we should not deny this meaning (such denial is false pride虛妄).\"\n\n  Acknowledgment (承認) is the pivot from nihilism to poeticality:\n  1. Acknowledge non-rationality of meaning-seeking\n  2. Acknowledge feelings/meanings already exist (before we can choose)\n  3. Acknowledge constructions are constructions\n  4. Engage lucidly rather than denying or being intoxicated\n\n  **Buddhist parallel**: Similar to **yatha-bhuta** (如實, as it really is) knowledge in Buddhism—seeing things as they are. But:\n  - **Buddhist 如實知**: Seeing impermanence, suffering, non-self as they are → liberation\n  - **Author's 承認**: Recognizing non-rationality, constructedness, inescapability → lucid engagement\n\n  Different endpoints: liberation vs. poetic engagement.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"acknowledge\" or \"recognize\" for 承認. \"Acknowledge\" better captures the acceptance dimension (not just knowing but accepting). Avoid \"accept\" alone (too passive), \"confess\" (too religious), \"recognize\" alone (too neutral).\n\n---\n\n## 第〇实在 / 第一实在 / 第二实在\n\n- **Main translation**:\n  - 第〇實在 = \"Zeroth Reality\"\n  - 第一實在 = \"First Reality\"\n  - 第二實在 = \"Second Reality\"\n- **Alternatives**: None—maintain the numbering system\n- **Note**: See extensive discussion under **實在** above. Key points:\n\n  **Numbering is epistemic-structural, NOT ontological**:\n  - NOT \"degrees of realness\"\n  - Indicates: accessibility, constructedness, epistemic priority\n\n  **First Reality** (第一實在) = phenomena:\n  - Epistemologically prior (cannot be doubted without losing ground)\n  - Given before interpretation\n  - The basis for all constructions\n\n  **Second Reality** (第二實在) = constructions:\n  - Interpretations, models, concepts built on phenomena\n  - Includes \"objective world\" as model\n  - All metaphysical structures\n\n  **Zeroth Reality** (第〇實在) = putative ultimate:\n  - Would be \"behind\" or \"before\" phenomena\n  - Author's claim: In principle inaccessible—articulation makes it Second Reality\n  - Parallel to Kant's noumenon, Laozi's unspoken Dao\n\n  **Translation rationale**:\n  - Always translate with full phrase: \"First Reality\" (not \"first reality\" or \"the first reality\")\n  - Capitalize Reality to indicate technical term\n  - Include translator's note on first occurrence explaining the numbering is NOT ontological hierarchy\n  - The zero/first/second order is counterintuitive (zero comes after first epistemically) but matches author's mathematical thinking (0-indexed, like programming)\n\n---\n\n## Additional Notes on Translation Strategy\n\n### Sanskrit → Chinese → English Chains\n\nWhen Buddhist terms appear in comparative/explanatory contexts, include the full chain:\n\n**Example**: \"The author's rejection of internal essences parallels the Madhyamaka rejection of **svabhava** (Sanskrit स्वभाव → Chinese 自性 → 'self-nature' or 'inherent existence').\"\n\nKey chains to maintain:\n- **pratityasamutpada** (प्रतीत्यसमुत्पाद) → 緣起 → dependent origination\n- **śūnyatā** (शून्यता) → 空 → emptiness\n- **anatman** (अनात्मन्) → 無我 → non-self\n- **bodhi** (बोधि) → 覺 → awakening\n- **vedana** (वेदना) → 受 → feeling\n\n### Kumarajiva vs. Xuanzang Translation Traditions\n\nNote major differences when relevant:\n\n- **Kumarajiva** (鳩摩羅什, 344-413): Emphasized literary elegance, sometimes free translation, introduced 空 for śūnyatā\n- **Xuanzang** (玄奘, 602-664): Emphasized precision, more literal, established Yogacara terminology\n\nWhen author's usage echoes one tradition, note it (e.g., author's 境 usage closer to Kumarajiva's visaya rendering).\n\n### The Author's Usage vs. Buddhist Technical Meanings\n\nALWAYS distinguish when terms have Buddhist technical meanings:\n\n**Pattern**: \"[Author's term] resonates with Buddhist [technical term], but [key difference].\"\n\n**Example**: \"清醒的梦境 (lucid dreamscape) parallels Chan awakening, but where Buddhist 覺 aims at liberation from suffering (dukkha-nirodha), the author's 清醒 is epistemological recognition of constructedness without soteriological goal.\"\n\n### Terms to Keep Untranslated\n\nConsider keeping untranslated (with note) when:\n- No adequate English equivalent exists (Dao, dharma in specialized contexts)\n- Buddhist technical precision is critical (bodhi, pratityasamutpada in scholarly contexts)\n- Author deliberately uses as technical term (境 as \"E\" in formal passages)\n\n### Translator's Notes\n\nEssential translator's notes on first occurrence:\n\n1. **境 (E/Scape)**: Buddhist background (visaya/gocara), why \"realm\" insufficient, author's categorical formalization\n2. **虚无 vs. 空**: Critical distinction between author's nihilism and Buddhist emptiness\n3. **清醒的梦境**: Parallel to Chan awakening, but different soteriology\n4. **第〇/第一/第二實在**: Numbering is epistemic, not ontological; relationship to Buddhist two truths\n5. **诗意**: Author's original term for post-metaphysical stance\n\n---\n\n## Glossary: Quick Reference\n\n| Chinese | Sanskrit (if applicable) | Primary Translation | Buddhist Connection |\n|---------|-------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| 境 | visaya, gocara | Scape, E | Object-domain of consciousness |\n| 境界 | — | bounds, horizon | Domain-and-limit |\n| 虚无 | — | nihilism, the void | ≠ śūnyatā |\n| 空 | śūnyatā | emptiness | Lack of svabhava |\n| 清醒 | bodhi (parallel) | lucid | ≈ awakening |\n| 沉醉 | mada (parallel) | intoxicated | ≈ delusion |\n| 梦境 | svapna (analogy) | dreamscape | Like-a-dream |\n| 觉/悟 | bodhi/prajna | awakening/realization | Enlightenment |\n| 恒常 | nitya (opposite) | constancy | ≠ impermanence |\n| 无常 | anitya | impermanence | Three marks |\n| 我 | atman (rejected) | I, self | To be analyzed |\n| 无我 | anatman | non-self | No inherent self |\n| 感受 | vedana | feeling, experience | One of five aggregates |\n| 现象 | dhamma/dharma | phenomena | Given experience |\n| 缘起 | pratityasamutpada | dependent origination | Core teaching |\n| 自性 | svabhava | self-nature | To be rejected |\n| 实在 | — | Reality | Epistemic levels |\n| 超越 | — | transcendence | Beyond bounds |\n| 诗意 | — | poeticality | Author's original |\n| 德 | — | virtue, efficacy | Confucian/Daoist |\n| 道 | — | Dao | Ultimate principle |\n| 形而上 | — | the metaphysical | Above form |\n| 非理性 | — | non-rational | Outside reason |\n| 承认 | — | acknowledge | Pivotal recognition |\n\n---\n\n**End of Dictionary**\n\n**Prepared by:** Buddhism (Madhyamaka/Yogacara/Chan-Zen) Specialist\n**Date:** 2026-02-10\n**For:** jing-translation team\n\nThis dictionary should be used alongside the Analysis Report for comprehensive understanding of Buddhist philosophical dimensions in the 境集 collection.\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":228,"cache_read_input_tokens":62837,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":228},"output_tokens":25,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CXzpRJh69wrRMi3brCcaZ","type":"assistant","uuid":"fdbbb3b9-e862-4598-9734-1c3747eaec7b","timestamp":"2026-02-10T18:00:18.715Z"}

Legenravend/49 Workspace/Buddhism/Dictionary.md","content":"---\nmodified: 2026-02-10\ncreated: 2026-02-10\n---\n# Translation Dictionary: Buddhism Expert\n\n**Prepared by:** Buddhism (Madhyamaka/Yogacara/Chan-Zen) Specialist\n**For:** jing-translation team\n**Date:** 2026-02-10\n\n---\n\nThis dictionary provides translation recommendations for key philosophical terms in the 境集 collection, with special attention to Buddhist philosophical considerations, Sanskrit-Chinese-English translation chains, and the critical distinction between the author's usage and Buddhist technical meanings.\n\n---\n\n## 境 (E)\n\n- **Main translation**: \"E\" (technical passages), \"Scape\" or \"Experiential Scape\" (discursive passages)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Experiential Domain\" when emphasizing the bounded nature\n  - \"Phenomenal Structure\" when emphasizing the categorical construction\n  - Keep untranslated as \"jing\" with explanatory note when Buddhist resonance is critical\n- **Note**: This term carries the full weight of Buddhist **visaya** (विषय, sense-object), **gocara** (गोचर, range/domain), and **ayatana** (आयतन, sense-base). In Chinese Buddhist translation:\n  - **Kumarajiva** used 境 to translate visaya in Yogacara texts, meaning \"object-domain of consciousness\"\n  - **Xuanzang** used 境界 for gocara in Vijnaptimatratasiddhi (成唯識論), meaning \"range of activity\"\n  - Traditional usage: 境 is what consciousness takes as its object, NOT an independent external world\n\n  **Author's transformation**: The author preserves the Buddhist insight that 境 is structured by mind, not \"the world out there,\" but adds unprecedented formal precision through category theory. The author's E is simultaneously: (1) the experiential field (Buddhist visaya), (2) the structure imposed on that field (Yogacara vijnapti-structuring), and (3) a categorical system with tower structure that can be formally analyzed. This is NOT a departure from Buddhist meaning but a mathematical formalization of it.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: \"Realm\" loses the Buddhist resonance and implies ontological independence. \"Sphere\" or \"domain\" are too generic. \"World\" is too ontologically loaded. \"Scape\" (from landscape/dreamscape) preserves the phenomenological (what appears), structured (shaped by mind), and bounded (limited range) dimensions. Use \"E\" in technical passages to maintain the author's formal notation.\n\n---\n\n## 境界\n\n- **Main translation**: \"bounds,\" \"horizon,\" \"domain-and-limit\"\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"experiential boundary\" when emphasizing delimitation\n  - \"level of attainment\" when the Buddhist resonance of spiritual progress is relevant\n- **Note**: In Buddhist usage, 境界 carries two overlapping meanings:\n  - **Spatial sense**: the boundary or extent of a domain (e.g., 語言的境界 = the bounds of language)\n  - **Soteriological sense**: level of spiritual attainment (e.g., 菩薩境界 = the level/state of a bodhisattva)\n\n  The author uses primarily the first sense, but the second sense creates resonance when discussing \"清醒的梦境\" (lucid dreamscape) as a transformed state of awareness. The term implies both \"where this domain reaches\" and \"what can be reached within this domain.\"\n\n  **Translation rationale**: \"Bounds\" captures both meanings—spatial limits and accessible range. Avoid \"boundary\" alone (too rigid), \"limit\" alone (too restrictive), \"scope\" (too academic/neutral).\n\n---\n\n## 虚无 / 虚無主義\n\n- **Main translation**: \"nihilism\" (虚無主義), \"the void\" or \"emptiness-as-absence\" (虚无)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the vacancy\" or \"the absence\" when emphasizing lack\n  - \"nothingness\" when existentialist resonance is appropriate\n- **Note**: **CRITICAL DISTINCTION** from Buddhist 空 (śūnyatā/sunyata):\n\n  **Buddhist 空 (śūnyatā)**: NOT nihilism (断見, uccheda-vada). In Madhyamaka, emptiness (空) means absence of **svabhava** (自性, inherent existence), NOT absence of phenomena. Nagarjuna's MMK 24.18: \"Whatever is dependently originated, that we call emptiness.\" Emptiness is the Middle Way between eternalism and nihilism.\n\n  **Kumarajiva's translation strategy**: Used 空 (empty) rather than 無 (non-being) to avoid confusion with nihilism. The Chinese character 無 (wu) suggests absolute non-existence; 空 (kong) suggests empty-of-something (empty of svabhava).\n\n  **Author's 虚无**: The void LEFT AFTER metaphysics collapses. The author explicitly states: \"Nihilism is not a being, not a doctrine (主义), but an absence, a vacancy (缺位)... nothing is being produced or created anymore.\" This IS the nihilistic extreme (断邊) that Madhyamaka warns against. However, the author does NOT remain here—post-metaphysics is the exit from this void, parallel to the Middle Way.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Translate 虚无主義 as \"nihilism\" but ALWAYS include translator's note distinguishing from Buddhist emptiness (空). When 虚无 appears alone, consider \"the void\" or \"nihilistic vacancy\" to emphasize the negative, absence-character. Never translate 虚无 as \"emptiness\" (which should be reserved for 空/śūnyatā).\n\n---\n\n## 空\n\n- **Main translation**: \"emptiness\" (when referring to Buddhist śūnyatā), \"empty\" (adjectival)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"void\" only when clearly distinguished from 虚无\n  - \"vacuity\" in philosophical contexts requiring precision\n- **Note**: This term appears rarely in the author's text, but when it does, it carries Buddhist technical meaning:\n\n  **Sanskrit śūnyatā → Chinese 空**: The central concept of Madhyamaka philosophy. Emptiness of svabhava (inherent existence), NOT emptiness of existence. The Diamond Sutra (金剛經): \"All conditioned phenomena are like a dream, an illusion\" (一切有為法，如夢幻泡影) describes emptiness, not non-existence.\n\n  **Author's minimal usage**: In the example \"when we strip away our characteristics... we eventually arrive at 'emptiness' (空),\" the author acknowledges this is the WRONG approach (choosing containment relations on physical objects rather than phenomena as P). The author's framework avoids reifying 空 as a metaphysical ultimate, which aligns with Madhyamaka's rejection of 空 itself as a view to be grasped.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"emptiness\" for 空 when Buddhist resonance is clear. Never conflate with 虚无. If both terms appear in proximity, use \"emptiness\" (空) vs. \"the void/nihilism\" (虚无) to maintain distinction.\n\n---\n\n## 清醒\n\n- **Main translation**: \"lucid\" (清醒的梦境 = lucid dreamscape)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"wakeful\" or \"clear-seeing\" in non-dreamscape contexts\n  - \"aware\" when emphasizing consciousness without Buddhist overtones\n- **Note**: 清醒 literally means \"clear-awake\" and carries overtones of Buddhist **bodhi** (覺, awakening). In Chinese Buddhist vocabulary:\n  - 覺 (jue): awakening, enlightenment (bodhi)\n  - 覺醒: to awaken (often used for enlightenment experience)\n  - 清醒: everyday term for being awake/sober, but in philosophical context resonates with 覺\n\n  **Author's usage**: \"清醒的梦境\" (lucid dreamscape) describes engagement with meaning-structures WHILE KNOWING they are constructions. This parallels Chan awakening's third stage: \"After enlightenment, mountains are mountains again\" (青原惟信)—return to full engagement with transformed understanding.\n\n  **Difference from Buddhist awakening**: Buddhist 覺 typically implies cessation of fundamental ignorance (avidya/無明). The author's 清醒 is epistemological (knowing the constructedness) rather than soteriological (liberation from suffering). But the structural parallel is profound: both involve seeing-through without disengaging.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: \"Lucid\" captures both \"clear-seeing\" and the dreamscape context (as in \"lucid dreaming\"—knowing you're dreaming while in the dream). Avoid \"awakened\" (too specifically Buddhist) and \"conscious\" (too Cartesian/neutral). \"Wakeful\" is acceptable but less evocative.\n\n---\n\n## 沉醉\n\n- **Main translation**: \"intoxicated\" (沉醉的梦境 = intoxicated dreamscape)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"immersed\" when intoxication metaphor is too strong\n  - \"entranced\" when emphasizing loss of critical awareness\n- **Note**: 沉醉 literally means \"sink-drunk,\" combining submersion (沉) and intoxication (醉). In Buddhist psychology:\n  - **mada** (憍, 醉): intoxication/pride, one of the klesha (煩惱, afflictions)\n  - **moha** (癡): delusion, fundamental ignorance\n\n  **Author's usage**: \"沉醉的梦境\" describes engagement WITHOUT awareness that meaning-structures are constructions. This is faith/belief (信念/信仰) where purpose appears logically groundless but historically conditioned. The metaphor: drunk on the dream, unaware it's a dream.\n\n  **Buddhist parallel**: Corresponds to pre-awakening state, where one takes conceptual constructions (prapanca/戲論) as ultimately real. The intoxication metaphor recalls Buddhist warnings against the \"intoxicants\" (madya/酒) that cloud discernment.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: \"Intoxicated\" preserves the Buddhist resonance of clouded awareness (mada) and the author's metaphor of being \"drunk\" on meaning. Avoid \"unconscious\" (too negative) and \"naive\" (too judgmental). \"Immersed\" is acceptable but loses the critique of clouded judgment.\n\n---\n\n## 梦境\n\n- **Main translation**: \"dreamscape\"\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"dream-realm\" when emphasizing bounded domain\n  - \"dream-construction\" when emphasizing constructed nature\n- **Note**: 梦 (dream) + 境 (scape/domain). The author explicitly distinguishes this from \"illusion to be dispelled\":\n\n  **Buddhist dream analogy**:\n  - **svapna** (夢): standard example of emptiness in Madhyamaka and Yogacara\n  - **Diamond Sutra**: \"All conditioned phenomena are like a dream\" (如夢幻泡影)\n  - **Madhyamaka usage**: Dream objects FUNCTION within the dream even though they lack inherent existence. A dream fire can warm a dream body. This is NOT nihilism—it's the Middle Way.\n\n  **Author's usage**: 梦境 is the \"environment\" (環境) in which meaning and purpose can exist. Games, novels, rituals, lived frameworks—all are dreamscapes. The author emphasizes: \"清醒的梦境 still necessarily means full engagement\" (清醒的梦境依旧也必然意味着对梦境的全身心之投入). This perfectly parallels the Buddhist bodhisattva who saves beings while knowing there are no beings to save (Diamond Sutra).\n\n  **Critical point**: The author's 梦境 is NOT illusion (幻) to be escaped but structure to be engaged with lucidly. This aligns with Madhyamaka's insistence that emptiness doesn't negate function.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: \"Dreamscape\" (not just \"dream\") captures the spatial/environmental dimension and the constructed-yet-immersive quality. Avoid \"illusion\" (implies falsity to be rejected), \"fantasy\" (too escapist), \"construct\" (too abstract/clinical).\n\n---\n\n## 觉 / 悟\n\n- **Main translation**: \"awakening\" (覺), \"realization\" (悟), or \"enlightenment\" (覺悟)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"insight\" for 悟 in non-technical contexts\n  - \"bodhi\" (untranslated) when Sanskrit reference is critical\n- **Note**: These terms appear minimally in the author's text but are essential background:\n\n  **Buddhist technical terms**:\n  - **覺 (jue)**: Sanskrit **bodhi** (बोधि), awakening/enlightenment\n  - **悟 (wu)**: realization, insight (often used in Chan for sudden awakening, Japanese **satori**)\n  - **覺悟**: compound meaning awakening-realization, the process or event of enlightenment\n\n  **Chinese translation history**:\n  - Kumarajiva: used 覺 for bodhi, emphasizing awakening aspect\n  - Xuanzang: used 覺 for bodhi, 悟 for pratipatti (realization through practice)\n  - Chan tradition: 悟 becomes central (頓悟 sudden awakening, 漸悟 gradual awakening)\n\n  **Author's non-usage**: The author avoids these terms, using instead 清醒 (lucid) and 承認 (recognition/acknowledgment). This is deliberate—avoiding Buddhist technical vocabulary while arriving at structurally similar insights. When discussing \"what Chan calls 悟,\" use \"awakening.\"\n\n  **Translation rationale**: When these terms appear in explanatory/comparative contexts (discussing Buddhist parallels), use \"awakening\" (覺) and \"realization\" (悟). Maintain distinction from the author's 清醒 (lucid).\n\n---\n\n## 恒常\n\n- **Main translation**: \"constancy\"\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"permanence\" only when ontological claim is explicit\n  - \"stability\" when emphasizing functional continuity\n- **Note**: 恒常 (heng chang) = enduring-constant. The author identifies this as \"the core of metaphysics\" (形而上学的核心是恒常):\n\n  **Buddhist contrast: anitya** (無常, impermanence):\n  - **Sanskrit anitya → Chinese 無常**: The first of three marks of existence (trilaksana)\n  - **Buddhist teaching**: Taking the impermanent as permanent (於無常執常) is one of the four cognitive inversions (viparyasa/顛倒)\n  - **Satipatthana Sutta**: Observe arising and passing (samudaya-vaya) in all phenomena\n\n  **Author's analysis**: \"We need to find (pursue) a constancy (恒常) within changing phenomena, so that we can intentionally perform any action with results meaningful to us.\" Constancy is a \"guarantee\" (保證) that same phenomena will REPEAT. This pursuit is non-rational but necessary.\n\n  **Key difference**: Buddhism identifies pursuit of permanence as rooted in **avidya** (ignorance/無明) to be OVERCOME. The author identifies pursuit of constancy as non-rational feature to be RECOGNIZED (承認) and worked with lucidly, not eliminated. This is a different soteriological stance—post-metaphysical constancy-seeking rather than cessation of constancy-seeking.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: \"Constancy\" better than \"permanence\" (which sounds like Buddhist 常/nitya as metaphysical claim). The author's 恒常 is about pursuit of repeatability and stability, not assertion of permanent essences. Avoid \"invariance\" (too mathematical) and \"persistence\" (too weak).\n\n---\n\n## 无常\n\n- **Main translation**: \"impermanence\"\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"impermanent\" (adjectival)\n  - \"transience\" when poetic tone is appropriate\n- **Note**: **Buddhist technical term**:\n  - **Sanskrit anitya → Chinese 無常**: Fundamental teaching across all Buddhist schools\n  - **Three marks of existence** (trilaksana/三法印): All conditioned phenomena are impermanent (anicca/無常), suffering (dukkha/苦), non-self (anatta/無我)\n\n  The author's text does not use 无常 frequently, focusing instead on 恒常 (constancy) as the metaphysical drive. The absence is notable—the author approaches from the phenomenology of our pursuit of stability rather than asserting impermanence as ontological truth.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"impermanence\" (noun) or \"impermanent\" (adjective) for 無常 when discussing Buddhist doctrine. Maintain contrast with author's 恒常 (constancy).\n\n---\n\n## 我\n\n- **Main translation**: \"I,\" \"self,\" \"me\" (depending on grammatical context)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the I\" when discussing 我 as concept/object of analysis\n  - \"ego\" only in psychoanalytic contexts (avoid Buddhist conflation)\n- **Note**: The author provides a formal definition: \"'I' is that feeling, the feeling that whenever you mention any aspect related to me, it causes me to associate—that feeling is me.\" Formally: \"I\" is the universal property (terminal object) of a subcategory whose objects are all experiences related to me.\n\n  **Buddhist anatman** (無我, non-self):\n  - **Sanskrit anatman/anatta → Chinese 無我**: No permanent, unchanging, independent self\n  - **Milindapanha's chariot analogy**: \"Self\" is a designation for the five aggregates (skandha/蘊), not a substance\n  - **Nagarjuna (MMK 18)**: The self cannot be found among the aggregates, yet functions as conventional designation\n\n  **Remarkable convergence**: The author's category-theoretic definition—self as structural position (universal property) in network of associations, not substance—IS the Middle Way on self:\n  - NOT eternalism: there IS a \"feeling of I,\" it's experienceable, not nothing\n  - NOT nihilism: no self-substance; \"I\" is terminal object in subcategory, constituted by relations\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"I\" for 我 in most contexts. Use \"the I\" or \"the self\" when 我 is discussed as philosophical concept. Avoid \"ego\" (Freudian baggage) and \"atman\" (Hindu concept that Buddhism rejects).\n\n---\n\n## 无我\n\n- **Main translation**: \"non-self\" (philosophical), \"selflessness\" (ethical)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"no-self\" when emphasizing negation\n  - \"anatman\" (untranslated) when Sanskrit reference is critical\n- **Note**: **Core Buddhist doctrine**:\n  - **Sanskrit anatman → Chinese 無我**: Denial of permanent, unchanging, independent self (atman)\n  - Across all schools: No entity that is permanent (常), unitary (一), independent (自在), controller (主宰)\n\n  The author rarely uses 无我 explicitly, but the category-theoretic definition of 我 (as universal property, not substance) functionally embodies the anatman teaching. The author arrives at non-self through formal analysis rather than Buddhist practice.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"non-self\" for 無我 in Buddhist contexts. The author's framework achieves non-self structurally without using the term.\n\n---\n\n## 感受 / 受\n\n- **Main translation**: \"feeling\" (感受), \"vedana\" or \"feeling-tone\" (受)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"experience\" when broader than affective tone\n  - \"sensation\" when emphasizing sensory origin\n- **Note**: The author uses 感受 extensively as foundational category. In the footnote: \"感受 has two meanings: (1) received information, i.e., stimuli; (2) the 'crystallization,' 'surge,' 'turbulence' that these construct. The second kind is also 感受.\"\n\n  **Buddhist vedana** (受):\n  - **Sanskrit vedana → Chinese 受**: One of five aggregates (skandha/蘊)\n  - **Buddhist definition**: Affective tone (pleasant/unpleasant/neutral) arising from contact (phassa/觸)\n  - **Dependent origination**: Contact → feeling → craving (vedana → tanha)\n  - **Satipatthana**: Mindfulness of feelings (vedananupassana) is crucial practice\n\n  **Author's usage**: 感受 is more comprehensive than Buddhist 受. The author states: \"feelings exist prior to the concept of I\" (感受存在于我的概念之先)—this aligns with Buddhist teaching that vedana is part of five aggregates (including feeling) that PRECEDE any reified self. But the author's 感受 includes what Buddhism would categorize across multiple aggregates (vedana, sañña/想/perception, sankhara/行/volitions).\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Translate 感受 as \"feeling\" or \"experience\" depending on context. When discussing Buddhist parallels, note that author's 感受 is broader than Buddhist vedana (受) but includes it. Use \"feeling\" for both to maintain continuity, with footnotes clarifying scope.\n\n---\n\n## 现象\n\n- **Main translation**: \"phenomena\" (plural), \"phenomenon\" (singular)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"appearance\" when emphasizing how things show up\n  - \"what appears\" (discursive)\n- **Note**: The author defines P (phenomena) as \"第一實在\" (First Reality): what is directly encountered, cannot be doubted. All metaphysical constructions are based ON phenomena.\n\n  **Buddhist dharma** (法):\n  - **Sanskrit dharma → Chinese 法**: Phenomena, elements of existence, experiential constituents\n  - **Pali dhamma**: In Theravada, the ultimate constituents of experience\n  - **Abhidharma**: Catalogs dharmas (mental factors, physical factors, etc.)\n\n  **Key distinction**:\n  - **Buddhist 法/dharma**: Analytical categories of experience (including mental factors)\n  - **Author's 现象/phenomena**: What is given prior to interpretation, closer to Pali **paccakkha** (directly experienced)\n  - **Husserlian phenomenology**: Author's usage has resonances but is distinct—less transcendental ego focus\n\n  **Author's critical move**: Phenomena (第一實在) are epistemologically prior. Any \"objective world\" (客觀世界) is a model GENERATED FROM phenomena (第二實在). This is almost precisely the Yogacara position that 境 is vijnapti-matra (唯識所現, appearance-only).\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"phenomena\" for 现象. Add translator's note distinguishing from Husserlian phenomenology (bracketing, transcendental ego) and from Buddhist dharma (analytical categories). The author's phenomena are the given experiential basis, not analyzable elements or noumena-behind-appearances.\n\n---\n\n## 缘起\n\n- **Main translation**: \"dependent origination\"\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"conditioned arising\" (more literal)\n  - \"interdependent co-arising\" (when emphasizing mutuality)\n- **Note**: **Central Buddhist doctrine**:\n  - **Sanskrit pratityasamutpada → Chinese 緣起**: The teaching that all phenomena arise in dependence on conditions (pratyaya/緣)\n  - **Nagarjuna (MMK 24.18)**: \"Whatever is dependently arisen, that we call emptiness\"\n  - **Formula**: \"When this exists, that comes to be; with the arising of this, that arises\" (此有故彼有，此生故彼生)\n\n  **Author's implicit embodiment**: Though the term 缘起 doesn't appear frequently, the author's CORE MOVE embodies it. From 范畴论与境: \"Rather than exploring 'the essence of things' as an inward direction, a more practical orientation is to explore 'the position of things' as an outward (relational) direction... any exploration of internal essence will ultimately convert into an exploration of its external extensions.\"\n\n  This is FORMAL EXPRESSION of pratityasamutpada: things are constituted by relations, not by svabhava (self-nature). In category theory, objects are defined by morphisms—this is the **Yoneda lemma**. Buddhist equivalent: a dharma is constituted entirely by conditions and relations.\n\n  **Hua-yen resonance**: The tower structure (morphisms are themselves objects with morphisms) resonates with Hua-yen (華嚴, Avatamsaka) doctrine of **shishi wuai** (事事無礙, interpenetration). Fa-zang's (法藏) Indra's net metaphor—each jewel reflects all others infinitely—is precisely tower-like.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"dependent origination\" for 緣起. When discussing author's relational/categorical approach, note this is formal expression of dependent origination without using Buddhist terminology.\n\n---\n\n## 自性\n\n- **Main translation**: \"self-nature,\" \"inherent existence\"\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"intrinsic nature\" when emphasizing inherent qualities\n  - \"svabhava\" (untranslated) when Sanskrit reference is critical\n- **Note**: **Key term in Madhyamaka**:\n  - **Sanskrit svabhava → Chinese 自性**: Self-nature, own-being, inherent existence\n  - **Nagarjuna's target**: Svabhava is what Madhyamaka REJECTS. No phenomena have svabhava—all are empty (śūnya) of inherent existence.\n  - **Definition**: Svabhava would be existence that is: (1) not dependent on causes/conditions, (2) unchanging, (3) not dependent on conceptual imputation\n\n  **Author's parallel**: The author rejects \"internal essences\" in favor of relational definition. This recapitulates the Buddhist rejection of svabhava WITHOUT using the term.\n\n  Category theory: objects are defined by morphisms (external relations), not internal content. Two objects are \"the same\" (isomorphic) iff they have same morphisms to/from all other objects. This IS the rejection of svabhava—essence is relational, not intrinsic.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"self-nature\" or \"inherent existence\" for 自性 in Buddhist contexts. When discussing the author's rejection of internal essence, note this parallels rejection of svabhava but uses category-theoretic rather than Buddhist language.\n\n---\n\n## 实在\n\n- **Main translation**: \"reality\" (with ordinal prefix when specified: 第一實在 = First Reality)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"what is real\" (discursive)\n  - \"the real\" (when discussing as philosophical category)\n- **Note**: The author's three-level framework:\n  - **第一實在** (First Reality): phenomena as directly encountered. Cannot be doubted. Starting point.\n  - **第二實在** (Second Reality): interpretations, models, concepts built upon phenomena. The \"objective world.\" All metaphysical constructions.\n  - **第〇實在** (Zeroth Reality): putative \"ultimate reality\" behind phenomena. Author's claim: \"When we propose 第〇實在, the very thing we propose BECOMES 第二實在.\"\n\n  **Buddhist two truths** (二諦):\n  - **Samvrti-satya** (世俗諦, conventional truth): ordinary language, concepts, practical engagement\n  - **Paramartha-satya** (勝義諦, ultimate truth): emptiness, absence of inherent existence\n\n  **Comparison**:\n  - Author's 第一實在 (phenomena) = basis for both Buddhist truths, not itself either truth\n  - Author's 第二實在 (constructions) ≈ samvrti-satya (conventional truth)\n  - Author's 第〇實在 (inaccessible ultimate) ≠ paramartha-satya (which IS accessible in Madhyamaka through prajna)\n\n  **Critical divergence**: Madhyamaka's paramartha is NOT behind or below conventional—it IS the emptiness OF the conventional. Author's 第〇實在 is IN PRINCIPLE inaccessible (closer to Kant's noumenon).\n\n  **Yogacara parallel**: Three-nature framework (**trisvabhava**/三性) maps more naturally:\n  - **Parikalpita** (遍計所執性, imagined) ≈ aspects of 第二實在\n  - **Paratantra** (依他起性, dependent) ≈ 第一實在\n  - **Parinispanna** (圓成實性, consummate) ≈ 第〇實在, except this IS accessible in Yogacara\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"Reality\" with capital R for 實在. Always include ordinal: \"First Reality,\" \"Second Reality,\" \"Zeroth Reality.\" Note these are epistemic-structural levels, not degrees of ontological realness.\n\n---\n\n## 超越\n\n- **Main translation**: \"transcendence\" (noun), \"transcend\" (verb)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"go beyond\" (verb, discursive)\n  - \"surpass\" when emphasizing overcoming\n- **Note**: The author uses 超越 in specific technical sense: what lies beyond the bounds of a given 境界. From 范畴论与境: \"The transcendent (超越) is what exists. Even though any research object must be within the bounds of thought (思想的境界), its material—'from WHERE do we propose these things?'—is given beforehand (此在, Dasein).\"\n\n  This is NOT metaphysical transcendence but phenomenological givenness. Heidegger's **Dasein** (此在) resonance is explicit. Transcendence is:\n  1. The process of \"putting into the basket\" (what makes phenomena appear)\n  2. Inaccessible DIRECTLY (beyond thought's bounds)\n  3. Studied through its RESULT (phenomena) and EVOLUTION (change in phenomena)\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"transcendence\" (noun) and \"transcend\" (verb) for 超越. Add note distinguishing from metaphysical/theological transcendence. Author's usage is phenomenological—what lies beyond thought's current bounds but manifests through change.\n\n---\n\n## 诗意\n\n- **Main translation**: \"poeticality\" (noun), \"poetic\" (adjective)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the poetic stance\" when emphasizing orientation\n  - \"poetic engagement\" when emphasizing activity\n- **Note**: The author's original contribution. 诗意 (shi yi) = poetry-meaning/intent. The author defines this as the stance of **清醒的梦境** (lucid dreamscape):\n\n  > \"After metaphysics, facing meaning should be poetic (诗意). Because feeling already exists, we should not deny this meaning (such denial is false pride). Because Zeroth Reality has been disenchanted, we cannot be intoxicated within it. What remains is only to treat it as it is—that is, lucidly. This is the lucid dreamscape, which I call poeticality.\"\n\n  This is the author's term for post-metaphysical engagement: knowing constructions are constructions, yet fully engaging with them.\n\n  **Buddhist parallel**: While Buddhist terminology centers on **upaya** (方便, skillful means) and **karuna** (慈悲, compassion) as post-awakening stances, the author articulates the post-metaphysical stance as POETIC—creative, intentional engagement with constructed meaning. This is a genuinely novel articulation.\n\n  **Contrast**:\n  - **沉醉** (intoxicated): pre-metaphysical/pre-awakening belief\n  - **虚无** (nihilistic void): post-metaphysical collapse without reconstruction\n  - **诗意** (poetic): post-metaphysical lucid engagement—the third way\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"poeticality\" (noun) or \"poetic\" (adjective) for 诗意. Avoid \"poetry\" (too narrow) and \"aesthetic\" (too broad). \"Poetic\" captures: (1) creative construction, (2) self-aware artifice, (3) full emotional engagement, (4) meaningful despite constructed nature.\n\n---\n\n## 德\n\n- **Main translation**: \"virtue\" (moral contexts), \"potency\" or \"efficacy\" (Daoist contexts)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"de\" (untranslated) when specifically referencing Daoist technical term\n  - \"power\" when emphasizing effective capacity\n- **Note**: 德 (de) is complex term with different meanings in Confucian vs. Daoist traditions:\n\n  **Confucian 德**: Moral virtue, cultivated character (仁義禮智 are aspects of 德)\n\n  **Daoist 德**:\n  - In **Laozi**: The manifestation/function of Dao (道). \"Dao generates, De nurtures\" (道生之，德畜之)\n  - Not moral virtue but natural efficacy, the power/potency by which things are what they are\n  - Author's example: \"What makes a human human\" = 人德 (human-de)\n\n  **Author's usage**: In discussing 道德仁義禮, the author uses 德 in Daoist sense—the \"operating principle\" of a category of things.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Context-dependent:\n  - Confucian moral contexts: \"virtue\"\n  - Daoist cosmological contexts: \"potency\" or \"efficacy\"\n  - Author's usage: \"efficacy\" or leave as \"de\" with note\n\n---\n\n## 道\n\n- **Main translation**: \"Dao\" (untranslated with note)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the Way\" (traditional translation)\n  - \"the Dao\" (with definite article)\n- **Note**: 道 (dao) is central concept in Daoist philosophy:\n\n  **Laozi's Daodejing**: \"The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao\" (道可道，非常道)\n\n  **Traditional meanings**:\n  - Literally: road, path, way\n  - Philosophically: the source/pattern of all things, the ultimate principle, the nameless origin\n\n  **Author's analysis**: In discussing 失道而后德, the author shows how 道 is:\n  1. Formally positioned as \"most above\" (形而上) in traditional metaphysics\n  2. Actually GENERATED from below (from phenomena upward through abstraction)\n  3. The author's footnote: \"道 is like the canvas for a painting\"—what allows existence to exist\n\n  This parallels the author's 第〇實在: when articulated, it becomes 第二實在. True Dao is unspeakable (不可道).\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Leave as \"Dao\" (untranslated) with note explaining concept. \"The Way\" is acceptable but less precise. Capitalize to indicate technical term.\n\n---\n\n## 形而上\n\n- **Main translation**: \"the metaphysical\" (as category of content)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"that which is above form\" (literal, for emphasis)\n  - \"metaphysical constructions\" when emphasizing constructed nature\n- **Note**: **Critical distinction** from 形而上學 (metaphysics as discipline):\n\n  **形而上** = the metaphysical, that which is above form\n  - Source: Yijing Xi Ci Zhuan: \"That which is above form is called Dao; that which is below form is called vessel (器)\"\n  - Author's usage: Any interpretive structure built upon phenomena (形/現象)\n\n  **形而上學** = metaphysics, the study of the metaphysical\n\n  **Author's framework**:\n  - **前形而上學** (pre-metaphysics): treats 第〇實在 as actually existent foundation\n  - **虚無** (nihilistic void): after metaphysics collapses\n  - **后形而上學** (post-metaphysics): recognizes all 形而上 are constructions upon phenomena, yet functional\n\n  **Translation rationale**:\n  - 形而上 → \"the metaphysical\" (note: as category, not discipline)\n  - 形而上學 → \"metaphysics\" (the discipline)\n\n---\n\n## 非理性\n\n- **Main translation**: \"non-rational\"\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"arational\" when emphasizing neither rational nor irrational\n  - \"beyond reason\" (discursive)\n- **Note**: The author's crucial move: \"The purpose of reason must lie outside reason... the pursuit of ultimate reality itself is non-rational.\"\n\n  And critically: \"This non-rationality should be **acknowledged** (承認).\"\n\n  **Not irrationality** (against reason) but **non-rationality** (outside reason's scope). The pursuit of constancy, meaning, purpose is not rationally justified but is irreducible feature of human existence.\n\n  **Buddhist parallel**: Buddhism identifies **tanha** (渴愛, craving) as root of suffering. However:\n  - **Buddhism**: Aims to OVERCOME tanha through path\n  - **Author**: Aims to RECOGNIZE non-rational drives and work with them lucidly\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"non-rational\" (not \"irrational\"). \"Irrational\" implies deficiency; \"non-rational\" indicates outside reason's domain.\n\n---\n\n## 承认\n\n- **Main translation**: \"recognize,\" \"acknowledge\"\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"admit\" when emphasizing acceptance of difficult truth\n  - \"acknowledgment\" (noun)\n- **Note**: 承認 = bear-recognize, acknowledge. KEY TERM in author's post-metaphysics:\n\n  > \"This non-rationality should be **acknowledged** (承認).\"\n\n  Acknowledgment is the pivot from nihilism to poeticality:\n  1. Acknowledge non-rationality of meaning-seeking\n  2. Acknowledge feelings/meanings already exist (before we can choose)\n  3. Acknowledge constructions are constructions\n  4. Engage lucidly rather than denying or being intoxicated\n\n  **Buddhist parallel**: Similar to **yatha-bhuta** (如實, as it really is) knowledge—seeing things as they are. But different endpoints: liberation vs. poetic engagement.\n\n  **Translation rationale**: Use \"acknowledge\" or \"recognize\" for 承認. \"Acknowledge\" better captures the acceptance dimension.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference Glossary\n\n| Chinese | Sanskrit | Primary Translation | Buddhist Connection |\n|---------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| 境 | visaya, gocara | Scape, E | Object-domain of consciousness |\n| 虚无 | — | nihilism, the void | ≠ śūnyatā |\n| 空 | śūnyatā | emptiness | Lack of svabhava |\n| 清醒 | bodhi (parallel) | lucid | ≈ awakening |\n| 沉醉 | mada (parallel) | intoxicated | ≈ delusion |\n| 梦境 | svapna (analogy) | dreamscape | Like-a-dream |\n| 恒常 | nitya (opposite) | constancy | ≠ impermanence |\n| 无常 | anitya | impermanence | Three marks |\n| 我 | atman (rejected) | I, self | To be analyzed |\n| 无我 | anatman | non-self | No inherent self |\n| 感受 | vedana | feeling, experience | One of five aggregates |\n| 现象 | dhamma | phenomena | Given experience |\n| 缘起 | pratityasamutpada | dependent origination | Core teaching |\n| 自性 | svabhava | self-nature | To be rejected |\n| 诗意 | — | poeticality | Author's original |\n| 道 | — | Dao | Ultimate principle |\n| 非理性 | — | non-rational | Outside reason |\n| 承认 | — | acknowledge | Pivotal recognition |\n\n---\n\n**End of Dictionary**\n\nThis dictionary should be used alongside the Analysis Report for comprehensive understanding of Buddhist philosophical dimensions in the 境集 collection.\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":351,"cache_read_input_tokens":75255,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":351},"output_tokens":25,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CXzpoGdgEwyh1Ungb8qWc","type":"assistant","uuid":"d44801a4-f7ec-4f44-b0ca-488d1589b55f","timestamp":"2026-02-10T18:04:20.677Z"}

The dictionary includes detailed entries for the following key terms with Buddhist philosophical considerations:\n\n### Core Terms Covered:\n\n**境 (E)** - Recommended as \"Scape\" or \"E\", connecting to Buddhist visaya/gocara, with notes on Kumarajiva and Xuanzang translation traditions\n\n**虚无 vs. 空** - Critical distinction between author's nihilism (the void after metaphysics collapses) and Buddhist śūnyatā (emptiness of svabhava)\n\n**清醒的梦境 / 沉醉的梦境** - \"Lucid dreamscape\" vs. \"intoxicated dreamscape\", paralleling Chan awakening but with different soteriology\n\n**恒常 / 无常** - \"Constancy\" vs. \"impermanence\", noting the author seeks to recognize (承認) non-rational constancy-seeking rather than overcome it\n\n**我 / 无我** - The author's category-theoretic definition (universal property) as Middle Way between eternalism and nihilism\n\n**感受** - \"Feeling/experience\", broader than Buddhist vedana but including it\n\n**缘起 / 自性** - The author's relational approach as formal expression of dependent origination and rejection of svabhava\n\n**实在** - Three-level framework (第〇/第一/第二實在) compared to Buddhist two truths and Yogacara trisvabhava\n\n**诗意** - \"Poeticality\", the author's original term for post-metaphysical lucid engagement\n\n**道德仁義禮** - Daoist/Confucian terms with translation strategies\n\n**非理性 / 承认** - \"Non-rational\" and \"acknowledge\" as pivotal terms in post-metaphysics\n\n### Key Features:\n\n- **Sanskrit → Chinese → English chains** for all Buddhist technical terms\n- **Kumarajiva vs. Xuanzang** translation tradition notes\n- **Critical distinctions** between author's usage and Buddhist technical meanings\n- **Translation rationale** for each term explaining why certain English words are preferred\n- **Quick reference glossary** table at the end\n\nThe dictionary emphasizes that the author arrives at many structurally similar insights to Buddhist philosophy through category theory and phenomenology, while maintaining important differences in soter\n\niological orientation (poetic engagement vs. liberation).\n\nWould you like me to provide the full dictionary text in sections so you can copy it, or would you prefer a different format?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":204,"cache_read_input_tokens":85503,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":204},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CXzq7HSYmAqyowdWn1SFD","type":"assistant","uuid":"e1bde7bd-ea4a-4100-ba96-d11b8d0bc278","timestamp":"2026-02-10T18:04:45.914Z"}
