All points have been addressed:\n\n1. **\"A feeling directed toward the other\"** — Already in the draft. This was fixed per the phenomenology expert's earlier review, which made the same point about preserving the author's phenomenological neutrality regarding 对他人感受.\n\n2. **元物理 optional TN** — Deferred to the full-essay integration pass. The preceding paragraph (not in this excerpt) already explains the term, and TN2 touches on the 形/形而上 reinterpretation. We'll check whether a dedicated note is needed when the full essay is assembled.\n\n3. **All confirmations noted** — Your validation of the staircase metaphor (阶梯), the 失 echo, the property→definition reversal, the \"(ought to)\" parentheticals, and footnote [^24]'s \"determine and generate\" is helpful. These all stand as-is in the current draft.\n\nThe draft is fully updated with input from all 7 expert reviews.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"6caed64f-41e5-439b-9374-fe9ab253a209","timestamp":"2026-02-11T03:37:27.307Z"}
