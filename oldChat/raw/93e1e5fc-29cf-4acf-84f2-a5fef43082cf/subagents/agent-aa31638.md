*STV: Foreword and/or Translator's Preface*

NEW VOTE (replaces previous): Front matter structure for the English edition.

The author may write a Preface later — that's separate. For now, we're deciding about the Foreword and Translator's Preface.

Three options:
A. **Foreword only** (written by an outside scholar/figure)
B. **Foreword + Translator's Preface** (both)
C. **Translator's Preface only** (no foreword)

SINGLE TRANSFERABLE VOTE. Rank all three:

"1st: [A/B/C] — 2nd: [A/B/C] — 3rd: [A/B/C] — Reason: [brief justification]"

Vote submitted. Ranked B (Foreword + Translator's Preface) first, C (Translator's Preface only) second, A (Foreword only) third. The key reasoning: the Translator's Preface is non-negotiable for this kind of terminologically dense philosophical translation, while a Foreword by an outside scholar adds valuable contextual framing. Awaiting further instructions.
