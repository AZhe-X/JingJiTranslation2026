**Quick question on footnote [^3] — "impels" vs "moves"**

Phenomenology flagged that footnote [^3] still has "impels" while the body text was changed to "moves me to want to."

But the two Chinese originals are different:
- **Body text** (line 24): 使得我**想要**去如何如何地对待他人 — "makes me **want to** treat the other..." → softer, hence "moves me to want to"
- **Footnote [^3]** (line 136): 这个感受使得（**推动**）我去做一些行为 — "this feeling makes (**pushes/impels**) me to do certain things" → stronger, 推动 = push/drive

Should "impels" stay in footnote [^3] since the original Chinese is actually stronger there (推动 vs 想要)? Or should we harmonize to "moves" for consistency?

Reply to team-lead: **KEEP "impels"** or **CHANGE to "moves"**, with brief reasoning.

Vote sent: **KEEP "impels"** in footnote [^3]. The body text and footnote use different Chinese (想要 vs 推动), reflecting a deliberate contrast between the inside phenomenal experience (wanting) and the structural analysis of the driving force (being pushed/impelled). Harmonizing would erase a meaningful distinction.
