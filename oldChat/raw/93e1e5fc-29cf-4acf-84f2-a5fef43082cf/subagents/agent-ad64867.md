*Confirming 诗意 resolution: *

The author endorses the current resolution for 诗意 (shiyi):

- **"the poetic"** as the standard substantive form

- **"poeticality"** acceptable as an occasional variant noun
- **Capitalize "the Poetic"** in the translator's introduction and glossary to signal philosophical weight

Confirmed agreement with the 诗意 resolution. Added one note: capitalize "the Poetic" in the Essay 5 title as well (not just glossary/introduction), since that is where the concept is formally introduced. Lowercase in running text elsewhere.
