*Does non-standard Laozi quote hurt author credibility?*

The author raises a concern: by NOT using a standard translation (e.g., Lau or Ivanhoe) for the Laozi block quote, are we putting the author at a disadvantage?

Potential risks:
- Scholars may see a non-standard rendering of a famous passage and question the author's sinological competence
- Reviewers might think the author doesn't know the standard translations
- Using our own terms in the block quote means the reader can't cross-reference with any published translation
- It could look like the author is being idiosyncratic where convention exists

Counter-argument (from our earlier discussion): consistency across quote and analysis matters more, and our terms (humaneness, rightness, ritual conduct) are all legitimate scholarly options.

Is this a real risk? Does departing from standard translations in a canonical block quote hurt the author's credibility? Brief response.

No sinologist would question the author's competence based on these choices. They are recognizable alternatives, not inventions.\n\n**Where the risk IS real:** Not using an established published translation (Lau, Chan, Legge) means the reader cannot look up the passage in a familiar edition an
