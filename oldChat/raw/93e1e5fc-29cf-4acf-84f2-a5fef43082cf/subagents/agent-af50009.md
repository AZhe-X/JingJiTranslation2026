*经验: empirical experience or experience?*

Quick confirmation needed on the 经验 (jīngyàn) entry in the Translation Dictionary.

Context: During the 感受 debate, the consensus term mapping was:
- 感受 → "feeling" (default) / "felt experience" (technical)
- 体验 → "experience" 
- 经验 → "empirical experience"
- 感觉 → "sensation"

The question: Should the standalone 经验 dictionary entry have **"empirical experience"** or **"experience"** as its MAIN translation?

Arguments for "empirical experience":
- Distinguishes clearly from 体验 ("experience") in the term mapping
- Captures the accumulated, reflected-upon, Erfahrung quality
- The author uses it in phrases like "经验的总结/预测/抽象" (summary/prediction/abstraction OF empirical experience) and "经验性的" (empirical)
- Prevents reader confusion between 体验 and 经验

Arguments for plain "experience":
- More natural in English
- "Empirical" is implicit in context
- Adding "empirical" every time could feel heavy

Please respond with your position: "empirical experience" or "experience" as main translation for 经验, with brief reasoning.

My position: **"experience"** as the main translation for 经验, with "empirical experience" available as the disambiguating form when 体验 appears nearby. 经验 is the unmarked, natural Chinese word for experience -- adding "empirical" every time would over-translate. The collision with 体验 is theoretical rather than practical in this corpus.
