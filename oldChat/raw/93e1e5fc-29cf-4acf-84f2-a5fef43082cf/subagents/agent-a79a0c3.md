*Vote: add Editor agent to team?*

VOTE: Should we add an **Editor agent** to the team?

An Editor agent would be responsible for reviewing translated drafts for English prose quality, consistency, readability, and stylistic coherence across the collection — distinct from the philosophical/terminological review the experts provide.

Two options:
A. **Yes** — add an Editor agent
B. **No** — no Editor agent needed (experts + translator handle everything)

Reply: "A" or "B" with a brief reason.

An Editor agent would catch issues we're likely to miss: awkward phrasing, inconsistent register, sentence rhythm, paragraph flow, and overall readability for an English audience. Philosophical translation has a tendency toward stiff, over-literal prose — an Editor dedicated to English quality would be a useful counterweight. The division of labor is clean: experts ensure the translation says the right thing, the Editor ensures it reads well.",

Voted A (Yes) for adding an Editor agent. The rationale is clear separation of concerns: philosophical experts handle accuracy and terminology, while an Editor focuses on English prose quality, readability, and stylistic coherence across the collection.
