*Confirm: add Afterword + move spoilers from Preface*

ALL TEAM MEMBERS:

Confirm the following two decisions:

1. **Add a Translator's Afterword** — placed after all essays and the Appendix, before the Glossary. It will cover cross-traditional connections, translation choices, and scholarly positioning — all the things that would be spoilers in front matter.

2. **Move the spoiler content from the Preface to the Afterword** — specifically the structural claims paragraph (line 50: nihilism-as-consequence, absurdity dissolution + mechanism) and soften the Essay 3 punchline in the Experiential Sequences section. The Preface names topics without revealing conclusions; the Afterword discusses them freely.

Vote: **AGREE** or **DISAGREE** (with reason).

  "content": "AGREE. Both decisions are epistemologically sound. Moving the structural claims to the Afterword respects the collection's own epistemological method: the access argument establishes that justification works through phenomena first, and the philosophical experiments require the reader to encounter the phenomena (essays) before receiving the theoretical analysis (afterword). The Preface should orient without pre-justifying; the Afterword can justify freely because the reader's experiential evidence is already in place.",
  "summary": "AGREE — respects the collection's own epistemological method"
