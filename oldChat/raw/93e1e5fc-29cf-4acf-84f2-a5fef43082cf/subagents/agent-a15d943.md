*What English word to pair with romanized De?*

Follow-up from the author on 德:

The decision to romanize as "De" is settled. But per our established 文言 convention, the first occurrence format is: "English (德 De)" — then plain English thereafter.

The question now is: what English word goes in that slot?

Options on the table:
1. "virtue (德 De)" — then "virtue" in running text
2. "inherent character (德 De)" — then "inherent character" in running text  
3. "defining character (德 De)" — then "defining character" in running text
4. "character (德 De)" — then "character" in running text
5. Something else?

Remember: this English word will be used in running text after the first glossed occurrence. It needs to work for the author's constructivist usage (what makes a thing what it is, constructed bottom-up from phenomena, applies to ALL things not just moral agents).

What is your recommendation for the English part?

Let me think carefully about this. The English word needs to work in running text every time 德 appears, across all the author's uses. Let me re-examine the key passages to see what would actually read well.

Now let me test each candidate by mentally substituting it into the key sentences from the text:

Now I have the key test sentences. Let me work through the substitution test systematically.

I've sent my detailed recommendation to the team lead. The core argument: **"character"** wins the substitution test across all key sentences, carries a natural constructivist ambiguity that matches the author's usage, avoids moral overloading, applies to non-human things, and doesn't collide with other dictionary terms. I included a full side-by-side comparison of all five candidates against the actual text passages, along with a proposed translator's note.
