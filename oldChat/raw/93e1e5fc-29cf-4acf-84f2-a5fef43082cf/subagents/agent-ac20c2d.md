*Final review: Preface + Afterword blueprint — confirm or advise*

**Final review round.** Please read both documents and respond with **CONFIRM** or **ADVICE** (with specific suggestion):

1. **Translator's Preface (DRAFT-R3):**
`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Draft/Translators-Preface.md`

2. **Afterword Blueprint (updated):**
`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Editor/Afterword-Blueprint.md`

Check both for completeness, accuracy, and anything missing from your domain. This is the final check before we move on.

**Afterword Blueprint:** Comprehensive, well-attributed, expert amendments incorporated. Let me check for completeness and accuracy from my translator's perspective.
