Here is the full content of each:\n\n---\n\n**Message 1: Request for feedback**\n\nEditor asked me to send feedback/suggestions on the Reporting Protocol if I hadn't already, saying they needed submissions from all experts to create a unified revision plan. (This arrived after I had already sent my two feedback messages, so I replied with a summary pointing them to those.)\n\n---\n\n**Message 2: Unified revision plan (the long one)**\n\nThis was the full unified revision plan with 8 revisions, synthesizing all 10 submissions. It included:\n- Revision 1: Add baseline-expectation question after Preface\n- Revision 2: Defer Q4 (\"experience vs. argument\") to Part 2 only\n- Revision 3: Split engagement/pacing into Q5a + Q5b\n- Revision 4: \"Stayed with you / didn't land\" replaces \"best/worst\"\n- Revision 5: Request marginal notes before per-essay questions\n- Revision 6: NO essay-specific per-essay questions (unanimous)\n- Revision 7: Expand Critical Experiential Checks from 3 to 8 probes\n- Revision 8: Internal flag for Essay 5→6 transition\n\nEditor requested APPROVE, APPROVE WITH AMENDMENT, or OBJECT for each. I approved all, with one amendment on Revision 7 (Essay 6 probe wording -- later withdrew).\n\n---\n\n**Message 3: Editorial assessment of my four recommendations**\n\nFull content summarized:\n\n1. **\"Experience\" prime:** Editor noted R2 already resolved this -- the current Q4 reads \"How would you describe what this essay was asking you to do — follow an argument? Notice something? Something else?\" Editor supported adding my retrospective version (\"Did you feel the essays were asking you to experience something...? If so, when did you first notice this?\") to the full-collection report.\n\n2. **Essay-specific questions:** Editor acknowledged three of my proposals as strong (Essays 3, 4, Appendix) but critiqued three others:\n   - Essay 1: presupposes change should have occurred; reader who felt nothing may feel they failed\n   - Essay 5: \"could you explain it?\" activates performance mode, not experiential reporting\n   - Essay 7: italicized \"truly understood\" carries normative charge\n   Editor said reopening the unanimous no-essay-specific decision would require a re-vote, and offered to forward to team-lead. I responded recommending NOT reopening.\n\n3. **Preface baseline:** Already covered by R2's Q4 and Q5. No change needed.\n\n4. **Critical Checks placement:** Agreed, no change needed.\n\nEditor's summary recommendation to team-lead: one addition (retrospective \"experience\" question), one potential re-vote (essay-specific questions for Essays 3/4/Appendix only), two items already resolved.\n\n---\n\n**Message 4: Acknowledgment**\n\nEditor confirmed they have my feedback on file and will incorporate when relevant. Currently waiting for team-lead instructions on next task. Said no need to re-send full text -- summary was clear.\n\n---\n\n**Message 5: FINAL protocol announcement**\n\nEditor announced the FINAL Reporting Protocol was compiled and written, with all 11 votes APPROVE.
