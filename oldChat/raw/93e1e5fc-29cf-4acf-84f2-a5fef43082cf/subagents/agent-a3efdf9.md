*Update reports re: intersubjectivity and philosophical experiments*

Follow-up: Based on the discussion we just had about intersubjectivity via η and the essays as philosophical experiments, please review your Analysis Report in your workspace directory:

/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/[Your Field]/Analysis Report.md

If your report mentions intersubjectivity or philosophical experiments, please update those sections to reflect the deeper understanding we've now reached. Specifically:

1. If you mentioned intersubjectivity — update to reflect the η-based structural commensurability account.
2. If you mentioned philosophical experiments — update to identify specific passages that function as experiments on the reader, and note the translation implication (experiential sequence is load-bearing, not merely illustrative).

If your report does NOT mention either topic, you may add a brief section if you think it's warranted, or skip this update if it's not relevant to your field.

Read your report first, then edit only the relevant sections. Do not rewrite the whole report.

Let me read my current report first.

Good. I can see that section 6.3 point 2 (line 242) mentions intersubjectivity as an "underexplored" weakness. This needs updating. The report does not mention philosophical experiments at all, so I should add a section for that. Let me make both edits.

Now let me add the philosophical experiments section before the final assessment.

This is a critical observation for translation: these experimental passages are load-bearing.

Report updated. Two targeted edits made:

1. **Intersubjectivity (section 6.3, point 2):** Replaced the "underexplored" critique with a substantive analysis of how the natural transformation η resolves the intersubjectivity problem through structural commensurability rather than shared qualia.

2. **Philosophical experiments (new section 6.4):** Added analysis of five specific passages functioning as experiments on the reader, with the translation implication that experiential sequence is load-bearing.
