*Final confirm: feeling default, felt experience for scope*

**FINAL CONFIRMATION — 感受 and related terms**

The author proposes the following resolution:

1. **感受 → "feeling"** as default rendering
2. **感受 → "felt experience"** when broader phenomenological scope needs emphasis (e.g., formal/categorical passages where 感受 = any part of P)
3. **体验 → "experience"** (processual, durational, immersive)
4. **经验 → "empirical experience" / "experience"** (epistemological, accumulated — NEVER confused with 感受)
5. **感觉 → "sensation"** (raw input, Sense 1 per author's fn2)
6. **First-occurrence TN** explaining the author's two-sense definition (诗意 fn2) and the equation P = "the totality of all feelings"

This combines the majority recommendation ("feeling") with the minority's concern about scope (allowing "felt experience" when needed).

Reply to team-lead: **CONFIRM** or **OBJECTION** (with specifics).

  "content": "**CONFIRM.** The \"felt experience\" escape valve for formal passages is a reasonable accommodation. It preserves \"feeling\" as the default while giving the translator room where the colloquial lightness of \"feeling\" might genuinely mislead in technical contexts (e.g., \"we select felt experiences as objects in E\" reads more naturally than \"we select feelings as objects in E\"). Good resolution."

**CONFIRM** sent. The resolution gives "feeling" as default with "felt experience" available for formal/categorical passages where extra scope is needed. Standing by.
