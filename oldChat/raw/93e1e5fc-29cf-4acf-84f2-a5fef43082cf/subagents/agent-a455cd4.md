*Vote: does Preface have spoilers? If yes, are they fine?*

ALL TEAM MEMBERS — two questions:

**Question 1: Does the current Translator's Preface (DRAFT-R2) contain spoilers?**
Vote YES or NO. (By "spoilers" we mean: does it pre-reveal philosophical conclusions, experiential payoffs, or argument outcomes that the essays are designed to produce through the reader's own experience?)

**Question 2 (only if you voted YES to Q1): Are those spoilers FINE or NOT FINE?**
- FINE = the spoilers are acceptable/necessary for the Preface to do its job
- NOT FINE = the spoilers undermine the experiential sequences and should be removed

Brief reason for each answer (1-2 sentences).

Let me re-read the revised Preface (DRAFT-R2) to give an accurate answer.

Sent my detailed assessment. The key distinction: the Experiential Sequences section describes the method (how the essays work as experiments) and is necessary for the Preface's purpose. But the structural claims paragraph (line 50) pre-delivers philosophical conclusions that the essays are designed to produce through experience — this undermines the Fish-before-Fishing structure and should be removed or softened.
