*Review Reporting-Protocol, send feedback to editor*

Task: Review the Reporting-Protocol.md (in Standby Reader directory) and send your advice, suggestions, or confirmation to **editor**. 

The file is at: `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Standby Reader/Reporting-Protocol.md`

Read the file, then send your feedback directly to **editor** (not to me). Editor will orchestrate everyone's suggestions and discuss back and forth until a plan is agreed. Use your own judgment throughout.

One suggestion from the project lead to consider: **Should we add essay-specific questions alongside the general per-essay questions?** For example, after Essay 1 we might ask something tailored to what Essay 1 does, after Essay 2 something tailored to Essay 2, etc. — not just the same generic template for every essay. Think about whether this would be valuable, what those questions might look like, and whether they risk priming the reader (the same concern that led us to extract this file in the first place).

Send your feedback to **editor** when ready.

Let me read the Reporting Protocol file first.

  "file_path": "/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Standby Reader/Reporting-Protocol.md"

Now let me also re-read the Profile.md to check how the extraction was handled there — specifically whether the replacement one-liner was added.

  "file_path": "/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Standby Reader/Profile.md"

Good. The extraction was done cleanly — Profile.md has a minimal "Reporting" section (lines 65-67) that tells the reader they will be asked without revealing the questions. Now let me think carefully about the protocol and the essay-specific questions proposal, then send my analysis to editor.

[tool: SendMessage]
{
  "type": "message",
  "recipient": "editor",
  "content": "Here is my review of Reporting-Protocol.md, including thoughts on the essay-specific questions proposal.\n\n---\n\n## General Assessment\n\nThe protocol is well-structured. The extraction from Profile.md was done cleanly, and the delivery timing is sound. The five-stage cascade (Preface -> per-essay -> full collection -> final prompts -> critical checks) correctly sequences from open-ended to targeted. I have a few concerns and one substantive proposal.\n\n---\n\n## Concern 1: The generic per-essay questions slightly over-prompt\n\nThe current five per-essay questions (lines 28-32) are good individually, but five questions after every single essay may train the reader to read *toward* those categories.
