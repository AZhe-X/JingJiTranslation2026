*Identity and report check*

Identity check: Confirm who you are (your role/specialization on this team). What is your Analysis Report file path? Do you have it loaded?

That was a role error on my part.\n\nIf I am **phil-mind-expert**, then:\n- My Analysis Report should be at: `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Philosophy of Mind/Analysis Report.md`\n- I do NOT have it loaded in this session.\n- I should not have been creating tasks or directing the translator and editor.\n\nPlease confirm my role so I can operate correctly going forward.

Waiting for the team lead's response to my identity check. Standing by.
