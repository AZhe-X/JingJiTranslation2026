Present original 文言 text as a **block quote**\n2. Follow with **glossed English translation** — key terms glossed on first occurrence as \"English (漢字, pinyin)\", e.g., \"humaneness (仁, ren)\"\n3. After first introduction, use **plain English only**\n4. 现象X compounds keep \"phenomenal\" prefix always\n\nThis means for the Laozi block quote, the format would be:\n\n> [Original Chinese block quote]\n> \"When the Way (道, dao) was lost there was virtue (德, de); when virtue was lost there was humaneness (仁, ren); when humaneness was lost there was rightness (义, yi); when rightness was lost there was ritual conduct (礼, li).\"\n\nThen in the author's analysis, plain English: \"humaneness,\" \"rightness,\" \"ritual conduct\" — with 德 shifting to \"(constitutive) character\" as decided.\n\nGiven THIS format — where the glossed English already includes the Chinese characters and pinyin at first occurrence — does the question of \"the Way\" vs \"Dao\" still matter? The reader sees \"the Way (道, dao)\" and has both. \n\nReconsider your answer on 道 with this format in mind. Should it be \"the Way (道, dao)\" or \"Dao (道)\" in the glossed block quote?
