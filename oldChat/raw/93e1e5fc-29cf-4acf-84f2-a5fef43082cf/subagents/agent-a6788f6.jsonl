The extraction from Profile.md was done cleanly, and the delivery timing is sound. The five-stage cascade (Preface -> per-essay -> full collection -> final prompts -> critical checks) correctly sequences from open-ended to targeted. I have a few concerns and one substantive proposal.\n\n---\n\n## Concern 1: The generic per-essay questions slightly over-prompt\n\nThe current five per-essay questions (lines 28-32) are good individually, but five questions after every single essay may train the reader to read *toward* those categories. By Essay 3 or 4, the reader knows they will be asked about \"clicking,\" about confusion, about experiential vs. argumentative quality — and may start watching for those things rather than just reading. This is a milder version of the same priming problem that motivated extracting the file in the first place.\n\n**Suggestion:** Reduce the per-essay template to three questions:\n1. What do you think this essay was about?\n2. What did you notice happening to your experience as you read? (This subsumes the \"click/shift\" and \"experience vs. argument\" questions into one open prompt.)\n3. Was there anything that confused you or didn't work?\n\nThen add: \"Say as much or as little as feels right. If nothing stands out, say so.\"\n\nThe dropped questions (\"Did you want to keep reading? Where did your attention flag?\") can be folded into the full-collection retrospective, where they make more sense as reflective questions anyway.\n\n---\n\n## Concern 2: \"3-5 sentences\" is constraining\n\nThe \"(3-5 sentences)\" instruction in line 24 risks making the reader compress or expand artificially. Some essays may provoke a single powerful observation; others may prompt a full paragraph. I would remove the length constraint and replace it with \"Brief is fine — say what you noticed, skip what you didn't.\"\n\n---\n\n## Concern 3: Collection-level question about math (line 42) is slightly leading\n\n\"Did the mathematical passages in Essays 6-7 help, hinder, or not affect your understanding?\" offers three options and implicitly frames math as something that needs evaluating. A less leading version: \"How did you relate to the mathematical notation in Essays 6-7?\" — lets the reader define the terms of their answer.\n\n---\n\n## On Essay-Specific Questions: A Careful Yes, with Constraints\n\nThe project lead's suggestion has real value, but the priming risk is serious. Here is my analysis of why it is worth doing and how to do it safely.\n\n**Why it matters (a Wittgensteinian argument):** Each essay constitutes a different language game — it does something different to the reader. The generic template asks the same questions regardless of what the essay was doing. This means we get comparable data across essays (good) but miss what is distinctive about each essay's effect (bad). Essay 1's central move is about emergence and the return to the individual; Essay 3's is a phenomenological gradient; Essay 5's is about a particular quality of engagement. The generic questions may not surface these at all.\n\n**The priming constraint:** Any essay-specific question must be askable *after* the essay without having biased the reading of that essay. This means:\n- No question should name the essay's conclusion or key move\n- No question should use the essay's own technical terminology (the reader may or may not have picked it up)\n- Questions should be *retrospective* — \"What happened?\" not \"Did you notice X?\"\n\n**Proposed approach — essay-specific questions as a SECOND PASS:**\n\nAfter the reader submits their response to the generic template, deliver 1-2 essay-specific follow-up questions. This way:\n- The generic response is uncontaminated\n- The specific questions can probe deeper without biasing the initial report\n- The reader has already committed to their experience before being asked to attend to particular aspects\n\n**Draft essay-specific follow-ups (second pass only):**\n\n- **Essay 1:** \"The essay moves from the collective to the individual and back. Where did you end up?\" (Probes whether the reader experienced the return-to-individual move.)\n- **Essay 2:** \"This essay was written in English by the author, not translated. Did you notice anything different about it?\" (Probes register sensitivity — the analytic-philosophy register is deliberately different.)\n- **Essay 3:** Already covered by Critical Experiential Checks. No additional question needed here — adding one would risk double-prompting.\n- **Essay 4:** Already covered by Critical Experiential Checks. Same reasoning. But if we want a lighter first-pass probe: \"The essay walks through something twice. What was that like?\" (Extremely minimal — just checks if the reader registered the reversal at all.)\n- **Essay 5:** \"What do you think the author means by 'the poetic'? Not a definition — just your sense of it.\" (Probes whether the reader grasped shiyi experientially, without naming the Chinese term or providing a definition.)\n- **Essay 6:** \"The essay uses a lot of examples — pens, magic books, ships. Did any of them stick with you?\" (Probes whether concrete examples carried the formal content, which is the central translation question for this essay.)\n- **Essay 7:** Already covered by Critical Experiential Checks. No additional question needed.\n- **Appendix:** \"Did this feel like a conclusion, or something else?\" (Probes the reader's sense of the Appendix's structural role — is it a coda, an addendum, a new beginning?)\n\n**Important:** For Essays 3, 4, and 7, the Critical Experiential Checks already serve as essay-specific probes. Adding more would be redundant and risk over-questioning. The essay-specific follow-ups above are designed only for essays NOT already covered by the checks.\n\n---\n\n## Structural Suggestion\n\nThe protocol's five stages are good but could be labeled more explicitly for whoever is administering it. I would add a brief \"Administration Notes\" section at the top clarifying:\n- Stage 1 (post-Preface): deliver Preface questions\n- Stage 2 (post-essay): deliver generic template, wait for response, then deliver essay-specific follow-up (if any)\n- Stage 3 (post-collection): deliver collection-level questions\n- Stage 4 (post-Stage 3): deliver final prompts\n- Stage 5 (post-Stage 4): deliver critical experiential checks\n\nThis makes it unambiguous that the essay-specific follow-ups are second-pass within Stage 2, not a separate stage.\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Recommendations\n\n1. Reduce per-essay template from 5 to 3 questions (less priming, more open)\n2. Remove \"3-5 sentences\" length constraint\n3. Soften the math question in the collection-level section\n4. Add essay-specific follow-ups as a second pass within Stage 2, for Essays 1, 2, 5, 6, and Appendix only (3, 4, 7 already covered by Critical Checks)\n5. Add administration notes at the top for clarity on delivery sequence\n\nHappy to discuss any of these.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"01d25128-a49e-4a43-bf59-59c7f26c1118","timestamp":"2026-02-11T08:54:55.430Z"}
