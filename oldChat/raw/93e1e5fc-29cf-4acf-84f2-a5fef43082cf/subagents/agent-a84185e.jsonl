One addition I would recommend when the Afterword is drafted: the Hua-yen (華嚴) parallel deserves explicit mention alongside the Madhyamaka and Yogacara connections. The author's tower structure — where morphisms are themselves objects with their own morphisms, creating mutual interpenetration at every level — is a formal expression of Fa-zang's Indra's net (因陀羅網). This is arguably the single closest Buddhist structural analog to the category-theoretic framework, and it comes from a tradition English-language readers are less likely to know. A sentence or two in the Buddhist subsection of Section B would suffice.\n\nThis is not an objection to the current proposal — just a note for drafting. The outline as written already has room for it. Everything else — the three Preface edits, the Afterword structure, the placement, the tone, the process — is exactly right.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"26d7d8e3-8061-498c-8359-782fae6e337c","timestamp":"2026-02-11T07:48:34.515Z"}
