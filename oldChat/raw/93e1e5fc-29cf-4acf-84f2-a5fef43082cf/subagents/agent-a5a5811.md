*Standard translations all use *

New data for the 德 discussion. The passage 故失道而后德，失德而后仁，失仁而后义，失义而后礼 (Dao De Jing Ch. 38) has well-established standard English translations:

**D.C. Lau**: "When the way was lost there was virtue; when virtue was lost there was benevolence; when benevolence was lost there was rectitude; when rectitude was lost there were the rites."

**Wing-tsit Chan**: "When the Way is lost, only then do we have virtue; when virtue is lost, only then do we have humanity; when humanity is lost, only then do we have righteousness; when righteousness is lost, only then do we have propriety."

**James Legge**: "When the Tao was lost, its attributes appeared; when its attributes were lost, benevolence appeared; when benevolence was lost, righteousness appeared; when righteousness was lost, the proprieties appeared."

Every major translator uses "virtue" for 德 in this passage. Our decision was "(constitutive) character" instead.

Given this data — does this change your view? Should we:
A) Keep "(constitutive) character" — our reasoned departure from tradition, acknowledged in TN
B) Use the standard "virtue" for the Laozi block quote specifically (since it IS a quotation of a classical text), then switch to "(constitutive) character" when the author begins their own analysis
C) Something else?

Brief response with your recommendation.

**Option B** — this is the right call, and here's the precise reasoning:

**The block quote is a translation of a canonical text, not the author's own prose.** When you quote the *Dao De Jing*, you're participating in a translation tradition with established conventions. Departing from "virtue" in the quotation itself would read as either ignorance of the tradition or needless provocation. Neither helps the reader.

**But the author's analysis IS the place for terminological innovation.** When the author steps back and says "what Laozi means by 德 is better understood as..." — that's exactly where "(constitutive) character" earns its place. The author is arguing that the standard translation obscures something, and the new term is their contribution.

So the structure would be:

1. **Block quote:** Use "virtue" (standard translation, attributed to translator)
2. **Author's analysis:** Introduce "(constitutive) character (德 *De*)" with a TN explaining why "virtue" — while standard — misses the constitutive/structural dimension the author wants to foreground
3. **Running text thereafter:** Plain "character"

This actually *strengthens* the author's argument. The reader sees the familiar "virtue," then sees the author reframe it, and understands exactly what conceptual work the new translation is doing. The contrast between the two renderings becomes pedagogically productive rather than just confusing.

Sent my recommendation to the team lead. Option B — use the standard "virtue" in the block quote of the *Dao De Jing*, then introduce "(constitutive) character" in the author's own analysis — gives the reader both the established tradition and the author's reasoned departure from it, making the terminological choice pedagogically productive rather than opaque.
