*Vote: poet vs Dichter finding — Preface, Afterword, or not included?*

**New finding from existentialism-expert:** The author's concept of the **poet (诗人)** vs Heidegger's **Dichter** — a significant difference not previously covered.

The author says in the Appendix: "我们正是这样的创造者，是自己生命和感受的诗人" — "We are precisely such creators, poets of our own lives and experiences."

**5 key differences from Heidegger's Dichter:**

1. **Universal vs singular** — "我们" (we), everyone is a poet; not a rare chosen figure like Holderlin
2. **Creator vs receiver** — paired with 创造者; the poet *makes*, not receives Being's disclosure
3. **Self-directed vs community-founding** — "自己生命和感受的诗人"; not founding dwelling for a historical people
4. **Medium-indifferent vs language-bound** — any medium works (desk arrangement, photography, cooking, memes); language has no priority
5. **Already doing it vs called to it** — "我们已经、正在、且也将继续"; the task is to *notice*, not to become

**Key insight:** The author shifts the question from "How do I become authentic?" to "How do I notice that I already am?"

**Vote:** Should this finding be included in:
- **A) The Translator's Preface**
- **B) The Translator's Afterword** (in the cross-traditional connections section)
- **C) Not included** (leave it in the expert report only)

Respond with A, B, or C, with brief reason.

But it is precisely the kind of interpretive analysis that would be a spoiler in the Preface: the reader needs to arrive at the Appendix passage and feel the force of \"我们正是这样的创造者\" themselves before being told how it differs from Heidegger. In the Afterword, after the reader has encountered both the Poetic (Essay 5) and this closing passage (Appendix), the Dichter contrast becomes a powerful way to articulat

Voted **B (Afterword)** — the poet/Dichter contrast is substantive but would spoil the experiential payoff of the Appendix passage if placed in the Preface. It belongs in the cross-traditional connections section of the Afterword, where the reader can engage with it after experiencing the text themselves. Awaiting next task.
