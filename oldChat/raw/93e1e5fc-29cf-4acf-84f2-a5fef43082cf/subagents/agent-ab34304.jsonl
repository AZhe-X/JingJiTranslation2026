Language Games in the Framework\n     9→\n    10→### The Author's Usage of 语言游戏 (Language Games)\n    11→\n    12→In K1策略, the author explicitly invokes the concept of 语言游戏 (language games) as a method for investigating stable structures ($S_L$) within the linguistic sub-category $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$. The key passage states:\n    13→\n    14→> \"于是我们就可以通过语言游戏研究语言演化中的稳定结构 $S_L$，来间接获得对 $\\mathbb{E}_t$ 中 $S_E$ 的认识\"\n    15→\n    16→This usage represents a **productive but significantly reoriented extension** of Wittgenstein's concept. In the *Philosophical Investigations*, language games serve multiple functions: they are simplified models of language use (PI section 2), they illustrate the multiplicity and heterogeneity of linguistic practices (PI section 23), and they are bound up with \"forms of life\" (PI section 23). Crucially, for Wittgenstein, language games are **not instruments for discovering underlying structures**. They are the thing itself --- the level at which meaning operates. There is no deeper structure that language games reveal; rather, language games *are* the bedrock.\n    17→\n    18→The author, by contrast, treats language games as **probes** --- methodological instruments that, through the functor $(F_{E,L})_t$, can map linguistic stable structures onto experiential stable structures. This is closer to what we might call a **constructive-structuralist** appropriation of language games. Wittgenstein would likely resist this move, since for him the idea that language games reveal hidden invariants would itself be a philosophical confusion --- the very kind of theorizing he sought to dissolve.\n    19→\n    20→However, the author's framework is more subtle than a naive structuralism. The author acknowledges that the mapping $(F_{E,L})_t(S_L) \\approx S_E$ is only approximate, that it captures at best a partial overlap, and that the relationship is descriptive rather than constitutive. This qualification brings the author somewhat closer to Wittgenstein's therapeutic spirit: the framework does not claim to have found the *essence* of meaning, but rather offers a tool for mapping certain structural relationships.\n    21→\n    22→### Therapeutic vs. Constructive Conceptions\n    23→\n    24→Wittgenstein's conception of philosophy is famously therapeutic: \"The philosopher treats a question; like an illness\" (PI section 255). The aim is not to construct theories but to dissolve confusions by achieving a \"perspicuous presentation\" (*ubersichtliche Darstellung*, PI section 122). PI section 133 states: \"The real discovery is the one that enables me to break off doing philosophy when I want to.\"\n    25→\n    26→The author explicitly mentions 哲学治疗 (philosophical therapy) in K1策略 and claims that the framework explains why it works --- roughly, through the resolution of \"tension\" (张力) when experiential sub-categories lack a well-defined universal property. This is a **structural explanation of why therapy works**, which is itself a constructive philosophical move. Wittgenstein would not attempt to explain *why* therapy works in structural-mathematical terms; for him, the therapy works by showing us the way out of the fly-bottle (PI section 309), not by constructing a formal account of fly-bottles.\n    27→\n    28→**Assessment**: The author's use of language games is a **departure** from Wittgenstein's anti-theoretical stance, but it is a **self-aware departure**. The author does not claim to be doing what Wittgenstein did; rather, the author uses Wittgenstein's concept as one input among many in a constructive framework. This is closer to how Robert Brandom appropriates Wittgenstein --- taking the insight about the primacy of practice and embedding it within a systematic philosophical project --- than to the quietist reading of Wittgenstein associated with Cora Diamond and James Conant.\n    29→\n    30→---\n    31→\n    32→## 2. Meaning and Structure: 是结构先于意义，还是意义先于结构？\n    33→\n    34→### The Author's Resolution via Natural Transformations\n    35→\n    36→In K1策略, the author asks: does structure precede meaning, or meaning precede structure? The resolution is given through the natural transformation framework:\n    37→\n    38→> \"结构和意义之间的关系是自然变换：一句话能够被理解，他必须能够在心理过程的演化和结构的演化中达成如上所述的这种一致性感受$\\eta$\"\n    39→\n    40→This is a striking move. The author refuses the dichotomy by arguing that structure and meaning are related by a **natural transformation** --- neither generates the other, but they must be **aligned**. Understanding ($\\eta$) is precisely the experience of this alignment.\n    41→\n    42→### Relation to Wittgenstein's Meaning-as-Use\n    43→\n    44→Wittgenstein's meaning-as-use thesis (PI section 43: \"the meaning of a word is its use in the language\") dissolves the structure/meaning dichotomy from a different direction. For Wittgenstein, there is no pre-linguistic meaning that structure then encodes, nor is there a pure structure that then generates meaning. Meaning simply *is* the pattern of use within a language game embedded in a form of life.\n    45→\n    46→The author's framework can be read as a **formalization of why Wittgenstein's dissolution works**. If structure and meaning are related by natural transformation rather than by generation, then asking which comes first is indeed a confused question --- just as Wittgenstein suggests. The natural transformation framework gives mathematical content to the Wittgensteinian insight that meaning and use are co-constitutive.\n    47→\n    48→However, there is a crucial difference. For Wittgenstein, meaning-as-use is meant to *stop* philosophical theorizing about meaning. The point is that once we see that meaning is use, there is nothing further to explain. The author, by contrast, uses the dissolution of the dichotomy as a *starting point* for further structural analysis. This is characteristic of the author's general approach: taking Wittgensteinian therapeutic insights and converting them into constructive theoretical resources.\n    49→\n    50→### Contrast with Formal Semantics\n    51→\n    52→In truth-conditional formal semantics (Montague, Davidson, Tarski), meaning is identified with truth-conditions, and structure (syntactic/logical form) determines meaning via compositional rules. This is a clear \"structure precedes meaning\" position. The author's framework differs from this in several ways:\n    53→\n    54→1. **No appeal to truth**: The author's framework, consistent with the Knowledge essay, does not invoke truth-conditions. Meaning is experiential alignment ($\\eta$), not truth-value assignment.\n    55→2. **Bidirectionality**: Formal semantics maps structure to meaning; the author's natural transformation allows influence in both directions.\n    56→3. **Dynamic character**: Formal semantics is typically static (a sentence has its meaning at a time); the author's framework is inherently evolutionary ($t \\to t+1$).\n    57→\n    58→The author's position has more in common with **dynamic semantics** (Kamp, Heim, Groenendijk & Stokhof) and with **inferentialist semantics** (Brandom), where meaning is constituted by inferential role and responsive to context, than with classical Montague grammar.\n    59→\n    60→---\n    61→\n    62→## 3. The Picture Theory and Natural Transformations\n    63→\n    64→### Tractatus Picture Theory\n    65→\n    66→The early Wittgenstein's picture theory (Tractatus 2.1--2.225) posits that propositions are pictures of reality. A picture shares \"logical form\" with what it depicts (T 2.18). The picture \"reaches up to reality\" (T 2.1511) through a structural isomorphism between the elements of the picture and the elements of the state of affairs.\n    67→\n    68→### The Author's Natural Transformation Framework\n    69→\n    70→The author's framework posits that understanding occurs when the evolution of a formal structure (e.g., mathematics, language) and the evolution of experience are related by a natural transformation. The $\\eta_a$ component measures the alignment between two paths from structure to experience.\n    71→\n    72→### Comparison\n    73→\n    74→There is a **genuine structural parallel**. Both frameworks posit that the relationship between language/formalism and reality/experience is mediated by **structural correspondence**. However, the differences are substantial:\n    75→\n    76→| Feature | Tractatus Picture Theory | Author's Framework |\n    77→|---|---|---|\n    78→| Correspondence type | Isomorphism (static) | Natural transformation (dynamic) |\n    79→| What corresponds | Proposition and state of affairs | Structural evolution and experiential evolution |\n    80→| Nature of correspondence | Logical form shared | Alignment ($\\eta$) experienced |\n    81→| Status of correspondence | Metaphysical necessity | Empirical/experiential claim |\n    82→| Directionality | One-way (picture depicts) | Bidirectional (natural transformation) |\n    83→\n    84→The author's framework can be read as a **category-theoretic generalization** of the picture theory in the following precise sense: where the Tractatus requires a *single* structural isomorphism between a proposition and a fact, the author requires a *family* of morphisms ($\\eta_a$) that are *natural* (coherent across all objects and morphisms). The naturality condition is the key upgrade --- it captures not just point-by-point correspondence but **systematic coherence** across the entire categorical structure.\n    85→\n    86→Moreover, the author's framework **inherits the later Wittgenstein's corrections** to the picture theory. The Tractatus picture theory fails because it cannot account for the diversity of language uses (commands, jokes, prayers, greetings --- none of which \"picture\" anything). The author's framework avoids this by making the relevant correspondence *experiential* rather than *representational*. Understanding a joke is having the right $\\eta$ between the joke's structural unfolding and one's experiential response --- no picturing required.\n    87→\n    88→**Assessment**: The author's framework is best understood not as a generalization of the picture theory *per se*, but as a framework that **subsumes both** the picture theory (as a special case where $\\eta$ is an isomorphism) and the later Wittgenstein's meaning-as-use (as the general case where $\\eta$ captures experiential alignment).\n    89→\n    90→---\n    91→\n    92→## 4. Philosophical Therapy (哲学治疗)\n    93→\n    94→### The Author's Account\n    95→\n    96→In K1策略, the author provides a structural account of why philosophical therapy works, centered on the concept of 张力 (tension) --- the state where a sub-category lacks a well-defined universal property, so that experience cannot resolve into a stable terminal point:\n    97→\n    98→> \"这也是哲学治疗为什么有效的原因\"\n    99→\n   100→The author connects this to the idea that philosophical puzzlement arises from structural tension --- multiple potential universal properties competing without resolution --- and that therapy works by restructuring the category so that the tension is resolved.\n   101→\n   102→### Wittgenstein's Therapeutic Conception\n   103→\n   104→For Wittgenstein, philosophical problems arise from linguistic confusions: \"philosophical problems arise when language goes on holiday\" (PI section 38). Therapy consists in \"assembling reminders for a particular purpose\" (PI section 127) --- drawing attention to how words are actually used so that the confused philosopher can see that there was no genuine problem.\n   105→\n   106→### The Tension\n   107→\n   108→The author's account **explains** why therapy works; Wittgenstein would regard such an explanation as itself a philosophical confusion. Wittgenstein explicitly rejects the idea that philosophy should produce theories (PI section 109: \"we may not advance any kind of theory\"). For Wittgenstein, the therapeutic effect is self-evident once the confusion is cleared; there is nothing further to explain.\n   109→\n   110→However, the author's account does something that Wittgenstein's does not: it provides a **positive criterion** for when philosophical puzzlement should arise and when it should be resolved. By identifying puzzlement with categorical tension, the author can (in principle) predict which conceptual configurations will produce confusion and which will not. This is a genuinely productive extension, even if it violates Wittgenstein's quietism.\n   111→\n   112→Furthermore, the author's framework offers an interesting **bridge** between Wittgenstein's therapeutic approach and more constructive philosophical programs. If therapy works by resolving categorical tension, then constructive philosophy (building new frameworks, new concepts) is *also* a form of therapy --- it resolves tension not by showing that the question was confused, but by providing new categorical structure in which the tension can be resolved. This is close to what the author describes as the construction of 境.\n   113→\n   114→---\n   115→\n   116→## 5. Rule-Following and 恒常 (Constancy)\n   117→\n   118→### The Author's Account of Stable Structures\n   119→\n   120→The concept of 恒常 (constancy) is introduced in 后形而上学 整理 as the core of metaphysical thinking:\n   121→\n   122→> \"形而上的核心是恒常。我们需要在变化的现象之中寻找到（追求）一种恒常性\"\n   123→\n   124→In K1策略, this is formalized as stable structures $S_E$ preserved under the evolution functor $T$. The idea is that certain structural features of experience are invariant under experiential evolution --- they are the \"rules\" that constrain how experience can develop.\n   125→\n   126→### Wittgenstein's Rule-Following\n   127→\n   128→Wittgenstein's rule-following considerations (PI sections 138--242) constitute one of the most profound and difficult passages in 20th-century philosophy. The central problem is: what constitutes following a rule? Wittgenstein argues against any **mentalist** or **Platonist** account of rules. A rule is not a mental state that determines its applications, nor is it an abstract object that we grasp. Rather, rule-following is a *practice* --- it consists in the regularity of a community's behavior, and there is no deeper fact that makes the behavior count as following *this* rule rather than *that* one.\n   129→\n   130→The Kripkenstein paradox (Kripke's reading of Wittgenstein) sharpens this: for any finite sequence of applications, there are infinitely many rules consistent with that sequence. What determines that we are following addition rather than \"quaddition\"?\n   131→\n   132→### Comparison\n   133→\n   134→The author's formalization of constancy as functorial invariance is in tension with Wittgenstein's anti-formalism in several ways:\n   135→\n   136→1. **Formalization vs. practice**: The author treats rules as mathematical invariants ($S_E$ preserved under $T$); Wittgenstein insists that rules are constituted by practice, not by any formal structure.\n   137→\n   138→2. **Community vs. individual**: Wittgenstein's rule-following requires a community of practitioners; the author's framework is largely individualistic (analyzing the evolution of a single person's $\\mathbb{E}_t$).\n   139→\n   140→3. **Determinacy**: The author's $S_E$ is (in principle) mathematically determinate; Wittgenstein argues that there is no fact of the matter about which rule is being followed apart from practice.\n   141→\n   142→However, the author's framework also has **surprising resonances** with Wittgenstein:\n   143→\n   144→1. **No ground-level rules**: The author explicitly states that $S_E$ is descriptive, not constitutive. The stable structures are observed regularities, not prescriptive rules. This is actually close to Wittgenstein's point: the \"rule\" is what we observe in practice, not a Platonic entity.\n   145→\n   146→2. **Non-uniqueness**: The author acknowledges that different choices of sub-categories and different time-ranges will yield different $S_E$. This echoes Wittgenstein's point that rule-following is context-dependent and community-relative.\n   147→\n   148→3. **The role of agreement**: When the author discusses philosophical experiments and the possibility of evoking shared experiences across different people, the criterion of success is structural agreement --- \"只需要他们具有相同的结构性位置.\" This is remarkably close to Wittgenstein's emphasis on \"agreement in form of life\" (PI section 241) as the basis for following the same rule.\n   149→\n   150→**Assessment**: The author formalizes what Wittgenstein deliberately left un-formalized. Whether this is a productive move or a misunderstanding depends on one's reading of Wittgenstein. On a therapeutic reading, it is a confusion. On a constructive reading (closer to Brandom or McDowell), it is a legitimate extension that preserves the anti-Platonist and practice-oriented spirit while adding mathematical precision.\n   151→\n   152→---\n   153→\n   154→## 6. On Certainty and the Knowledge Essay\n   155→\n   156→### The Author's Argument\n   157→\n   158→In \"A Thought on Knowledge,\" the author argues that knowledge reduces to belief by analyzing each component of the traditional justified true belief (JTB) definition:\n   159→\n   160→1. **Truth condition**: methodologically impossible --- we have access only to phenomena, never to truth directly.\n   161→2. **Justification condition**: all justification ultimately rests on phenomena or beliefs; phenomena must be \"digested\" into beliefs to be used; therefore justification is ultimately belief about belief.\n   162→3. **Conclusion**: knowledge is, in practice, \"what each individual believes to be correct.\"\n   163→\n   164→### Wittgenstein's On Certainty\n   165→\n   166→*On Certainty* (OC), written in the last months of Wittgenstein's life, addresses Moore's \"proof of the external world.\" Wittgenstein argues that certain propositions function not as items of knowledge but as **hinge propositions** --- they are the framework within which knowledge claims, doubts, and justifications operate. \"The questions that we raise and our doubts depend on the fact that some propositions are exempt from doubt, as it were like hinges on which those turn\" (OC section 341).\n   167→\n   168→Key features of hinge propositions:\n   169→- They are not known in the traditional sense; they are the **conditions** for knowing (OC section 403).\n   170→- They cannot be justified, but this does not make them arbitrary (OC section 559).\n   171→- They belong to a \"system\" or \"world-picture\" (*Weltbild*) (OC section 162).\n   172→- They can change over time as practices change (OC section 96).\n   173→\n   174→### Connection\n   175→\n   176→The author's analysis and Wittgenstein's *On Certainty* arrive at strikingly similar conclusions through different routes:\n   177→\n   178→1. **Foundationalism fails**: The author shows that justification bottoms out in unjustified belief or circular justification. Wittgenstein shows that justification bottoms out in hinge propositions that are not themselves justified.\n   179→\n   180→2. **Practice over theory**: The author repeatedly emphasizes \"in practice\" (在实践中) --- what people actually do when they claim to know something. Wittgenstein similarly focuses on what Moore *actually does* when he says \"I know this is a hand.\"\n   181→\n   182→3. **Knowledge as communal standard**: The author proposes that knowledge is \"what most people in a field believe to be correct.\" Wittgenstein's world-picture is similarly communal and practice-embedded.\n   183→\n   184→4. **Historical contingency**: The author notes that knowledge \"changes over time (e.g., geocentrism).\" Wittgenstein explicitly allows that hinge propositions can shift (OC section 96--99).\n   185→\n   186→However, there is a significant difference. Wittgenstein would resist the reduction of knowledge to belief. For Wittgenstein, hinge propositions are **neither** known **nor** believed --- they are the framework within which the distinction between knowledge and belief operates. The author's move is more radical: dissolving the knowledge/belief distinction entirely. This is closer to **pragmatism** (James, Dewey, Rorty) than to Wittgenstein, who preserves the grammar of \"knowing\" and \"believing\" even as he transforms their philosophical significance.\n   187→\n   188→The author's analysis of scientific knowledge through the lens of high-energy physics (where \"fundamental particles\" are never directly observed, only electromagnetic signals in detectors that are then reconstructed through models) is particularly compelling and parallels Wittgenstein's observation in OC section 105: \"All testing, all confirmation and disconfirmation of a hypothesis takes place already within a system.\"\n   189→\n   190→---\n   191→\n   192→## 7. Private Language and Intersubjectivity\n   193→\n   194→### The Author's Position\n   195→\n   196→Across the essays, the author repeatedly argues that we cannot access others' inner states:\n   197→\n   198→> \"人类不仅永远无法真正知道其他人的真实想法\" (关于集体利益)\n   199→\n   200→> \"我无法真正感受到他人的内心感受\" (后形而上学 整理)\n   201→\n   202→Yet the author proposes a criterion for communication and intersubjective verification:\n   203→\n   204→> \"我们不需要本体论的验证不同的人获得了'同一'体验（例如Qualia），只需要他们具有相同的结构性位置\" (K1策略)\n   205→\n   206→### Wittgenstein's Private Language Argument\n   207→\n   208→Wittgenstein's private language argument (PI sections 243--315) argues that a language whose terms refer to the speaker's private sensations, knowable only to the speaker, is impossible. The key moves:\n   209→\n   210→1. A private linguist cannot establish a criterion of correctness for their sensation-terms (PI section 258).\n   211→2. Without such a criterion, there is no distinction between following a rule and merely thinking one is following a rule (PI section 202).\n   212→3. Therefore, the meaning of sensation-terms must be grounded in public, shared practices.\n   213→\n   214→### Analysis\n   215→\n   216→The author's position is **deeply compatible** with the private language argument, perhaps more than the author realizes. Consider:\n   217→\n   218→1. **Structural position as public criterion**: The author's proposal that shared experience is verified by \"structural position\" rather than by qualitative identity is exactly the kind of **public criterion** that Wittgenstein argues sensation-terms must have. We don't need to verify that your red *feels* the same as my red; we need only verify that \"red\" occupies the same structural position in both our linguistic/experiential networks.\n   219→\n   220→2. **Rejection of private access**: The author's insistence that we cannot know others' inner states, combined with the claim that structural verification suffices for communication, mirrors Wittgenstein's point that the \"private object\" drops out as irrelevant to meaning (PI section 293, the \"beetle in the box\" passage).\n   221→\n   222→3. **Category-theoretic formalization**: The author's framework provides a precise mathematical formulation of what \"same structural position\" means: isomorphic placement within a categorical structure. This goes beyond what Wittgenstein offers but is entirely consistent with his philosophical conclusions.\n   223→\n   224→Where the author diverges from Wittgenstein is in maintaining that there genuinely *are* inner states that we cannot access --- the framework preserves subjective experience as ontologically real even if epistemically inaccessible. Wittgenstein, by contrast, argues that the very picture of \"inner states\" that others cannot access is confused: \"The essential thing about private experience is really not that each person possesses his own exemplar, but that nobody knows whether other people also have this or something else\" (PI section 272). For Wittgenstein, this \"not knowing\" is not an epistemic limitation but a grammatical observation --- the concept of \"knowing another's sensation\" has no clear application.\n   225→\n   226→**Assessment**: The author's structural verification criterion is one of the most philosophically productive ideas in the collection, and it can be read as a **constructive implementation** of Wittgenstein's insight that meaning is public. The category-theoretic apparatus provides precisely the tools needed to make \"same structural position\" rigorous.\n   227→\n   228→---\n   229→\n   230→## 8. Forms of Life and 境/梦境\n   231→\n   232→### Wittgenstein's Forms of Life (Lebensformen)\n   233→\n   234→\"Forms of life\" is one of the most evocative and under-determined concepts in Wittgenstein. It appears only a handful of times in the *Investigations* (PI sections 19, 23, 241; PI p. 226). Its precise meaning is debated, but the central idea is that language games are embedded in broader patterns of human activity, behavior, and agreement. \"To imagine a language means to imagine a form of life\" (PI section 19).\n   235→\n   236→Forms of life are:\n   237→- **Not reducible to rules or structures**: they include the \"weave of life\" --- behaviors, reactions, training, natural history.\n   238→- **The given**: \"What has to be accepted, the given, is --- so one could say --- forms of life\" (PI p. 226).\n   239→- **Neither subjective nor objective**: they are the shared background against which subjectivity and objectivity make sense.\n   240→\n   241→### The Author's 境 and 梦境\n   242→\n   243→The author's 境 ($\\mathbb{E}$) is defined as a categorical structure on phenomena ($\\mathfrak{P}$): experiences as objects, associations (联想) as morphisms, forming a tower structure. 梦境 is the \"environment\" in which meaning becomes possible --- the \"packaging\" of experience within which purposes and significance arise.\n   244→\n   245→### Comparison\n   246→\n   247→There are genuine parallels:\n   248→\n   249→1. **Background for meaning**: Both forms of life and 境 serve as the background against which meaning, understanding, and purpose operate. Neither is itself an object of direct scrutiny --- both are the medium *in which* we think and act.\n   250→\n   251→2. **Given-ness**: The author's insistence that we cannot escape all 境 (\"抛弃所有的梦境即是不可能的\") parallels Wittgenstein's claim that forms of life are \"the given.\"\n   252→\n   253→3. **Multiplicity**: The author allows for multiple sub-categories ($\\mathcal{E}_L$, $\\mathcal{E}_M$, $\\mathcal{E}_K$) within $\\mathbb{E}$; Wittgenstein allows for multiple, overlapping forms of life.\n   254→\n   255→However, the differences are also significant:\n   256→\n   257→1. **Formalization**: 境 is explicitly formalized using category theory; Wittgenstein's forms of life are deliberately left informal. Wittgenstein would likely regard the formalization as a category mistake --- forms of life are not the kind of thing that *can* be formalized, because they include precisely those aspects of human activity that resist formalization.\n   258→\n   259→2. **Individualism vs. communalism**: 境 is fundamentally individual (each person has their own $\\mathbb{E}_t$); forms of life are fundamentally communal (they are shared patterns of activity). This is a deep philosophical difference. The author addresses intersubjectivity through structural correspondence, but the starting point is the individual subject.\n   260→\n   261→3. **Static vs. dynamic**: The author's 境 evolves ($T_t: \\mathbb{E}_t \\to \\mathbb{E}_{t+1}$); Wittgenstein's forms of life are relatively stable (they change historically but are not theorized as evolving).\n   262→\n   263→4. **Dreamscape metaphor**: 梦境 (dreamscape) --- particularly the distinction between 沉醉 (immersed/intoxicated) and 清醒 (lucid/awake) --- introduces an element of **self-awareness** that has no direct parallel in Wittgenstein. The idea of a \"lucid dream\" where one is fully invested yet fully aware of the constructed nature of the meaning-structure goes beyond Wittgenstein's framework. This is more reminiscent of Heidegger's distinction between authentic and inauthentic existence, or of the Buddhist concept of mindfulness within samsara.\n   264→\n   265→**Assessment**: 境 is best understood not as a formalization of Wittgenstein's forms of life, but as a **parallel concept** developed from different philosophical motivations. Forms of life are the communal background of meaning; 境 is the individual structural medium of experience. The two concepts address overlapping philosophical territory but from different starting points and with different emphases.\n   266→\n   267→---\n   268→\n   269→## 9. Translation Challenges\n   270→\n   271→### Key Terms with Wittgensteinian Resonance\n   272→\n   273→The following terms require careful handling in translation due to their proximity to --- but divergence from --- established Wittgensteinian terminology:\n   274→\n   275→**语言游戏 (language games)**: The standard translation of Wittgenstein's *Sprachspiele* is \"language games.\" The author uses the same Chinese term but with a different emphasis: as a methodological tool for discovering stable structures rather than as the bedrock of meaning. Translators should use \"language games\" but add a note distinguishing the author's usage from Wittgenstein's. Consider: \"language games (in the methodological sense)\" on first occurrence, then simply \"language games\" thereafter.\n   276→\n   277→**哲学治疗 (philosophical therapy)**: This translates straightforwardly as \"philosophical therapy,\" which is the standard rendering of Wittgenstein's concept. But since the author gives it a structural explanation (resolution of categorical tension), a translator's note should clarify the difference.\n   278→\n   279→**结构 (structure)** and **意义 (meaning)**: These are the central terms in the structure/meaning question. \"Structure\" and \"meaning\" are straightforward, but the translator should be aware that the author's use of \"meaning\" is experiential/phenomenological rather than truth-conditional or referential.\n   280→\n   281→**理解 (understanding) vs. 掌握 (mastery/grasp)**: This distinction is philosophically crucial. The author defines 掌握 as the special case where $\\eta_a$ is the identity --- a \"direct confirmation sense\" without mediation. This corresponds to what Wittgenstein calls \"understanding\" in its most robust sense. I recommend translating 理解 as \"understanding\" and 掌握 as \"mastery\" or \"direct grasp,\" with a note explaining that the latter is a technical term in the author's framework corresponding to the identity natural transformation.\n   282→\n   283→**恒常 (constancy)**: This is the author's term for the invariance at the heart of metaphysics. \"Constancy\" is adequate but risks confusion with Husserl's \"constancy\" (*Bestandigkeit*). \"Invariance\" captures the mathematical sense better, but \"constancy\" preserves the more phenomenological register. I recommend \"constancy\" with a parenthetical \"(invariance)\" on first occurrence.\n   284→\n   285→**境**: See the full dictionary entry below. This is the most challenging term.\n   286→\n   287→**规则 (rules)**: Standard translation. But note that the author's \"rules\" are stable structures ($S_E$), not Wittgensteinian rule-following practices.\n   288→\n   289→---\n   290→\n   291→## 10. Overall Significance\n   292→\n   293→### Does the Framework Achieve Something Wittgenstein Attempted?\n   294→\n   295→The relationship between this framework and Wittgenstein's philosophy is best characterized as **complementary rather than duplicative**. Wittgenstein sought to dissolve philosophical problems by showing that they arise from linguistic confusions. The author seeks to **describe the structure of experience** in a way that makes philosophical problems tractable --- either dissolvable (by showing that they arise from categorical tension) or answerable (by mapping experiential structures through formal tools).\n   296→\n   297→The deepest convergence is in the **anti-foundationalist** character of both projects:\n   298→- Wittgenstein: there is no foundation beneath language games and forms of life; they are the given.\n   299→- The author: there is no 第〇实在 (zeroth reality) accessible to us; phenomena are the 第一实在 (first reality), and all metaphysics is constructed *upon* phenomena.\n   300→\n   301→The deepest divergence is in their attitudes toward **formalization**:\n   302→- Wittgenstein: formalization is part of the disease, not the cure. Philosophical problems arise precisely from our attempt to force the richness of language use into formal molds.\n   303→- The author: formalization (specifically, category theory) is a useful tool that, properly wielded, can illuminate the structure of experience without claiming to capture its essence.\n   304→\n   305→### Is the Category-Theoretic Formalization Productive?\n   306→\n   307→I believe it is, for the following reasons:\n   308→\n   309→1. **Natural transformations capture something real about understanding**. The idea that understanding is the alignment between structural evolution and experiential evolution, formalized as a natural transformation, is a genuinely illuminating philosophical proposal. It gives mathematical content to the vague notion of \"grasping\" meaning, and it does so in a way that is consistent with Wittgensteinian insights about the primacy of use and practice.\n   310→\n   311→2. **The structural verification criterion resolves a genuine problem**. Wittgenstein's private language argument establishes that meaning must be public, but it does not provide a positive account of *how* public meaning works. The author's structural position criterion fills this gap.\n   312→\n   313→3. **The framework is self-limiting**. The author repeatedly insists on the descriptive (rather than constitutive) character of the framework, and on the tool-like status of category theory. This self-limitation prevents the framework from falling into the kind of metaphysical dogmatism that Wittgenstein criticizes.\n   314→\n   315→4. **Connection to empirical verification**. The proposal for \"philosophical experiments\" --- constructing experiences with specific structural properties and verifying that they evoke the predicted experiential responses --- is a genuinely novel contribution to philosophical methodology. This goes beyond what Wittgenstein, the formal semanticists, or the speech act theorists have proposed.\n   316→\n   317→However, a Wittgensteinian critic would rightly note:\n   318→- The framework may create new philosophical confusions even as it resolves old ones (e.g., reifying \"stable structures\" in experience).\n   319→- The mathematical apparatus may obscure rather than illuminate for readers not trained in category theory.\n   320→- The individualist starting point may miss the essentially communal character of meaning that Wittgenstein emphasizes.\n   321→\n   322→### Positioning in the Field\n   323→\n   324→Within contemporary philosophy of language, this framework occupies a distinctive position:\n   325→- It shares **inferentialism's** (Brandom) emphasis on structural relations over reference, but replaces inferential roles with categorical structures.\n   326→- It shares **dynamic semantics'** emphasis on meaning as process, but operates at a more fundamental level (experience rather than discourse).\n   327→- It shares **phenomenology's** (Husserl, Heidegger) emphasis on lived experience, but provides mathematical tools for structural analysis.\n   328→- It inherits **Wittgenstein's** anti-foundationalism and emphasis on practice, but converts therapeutic insights into constructive resources.\n   329→\n   330→The result is something genuinely new: a **structural phenomenology of meaning** that uses category theory as its formal backbone. Whether this will prove philosophically fruitful in the long run depends on whether the framework can generate specific, testable insights about the structure of understanding --- and the author's proposal for philosophical experiments suggests a path toward doing exactly that.\n   331→\n   332→---\n   333→\n   334→## Appendix: Notes on Individual Essays\n   335→\n   336→### 关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一\n   337→From a philosophy of language perspective, the most interesting move here is the analogy between macro-level concepts (collective interest) and the renormalization group in physics. This parallels Wittgenstein's observation that concepts can operate at different \"levels\" without reducing to their micro-level constituents (cf. PI section 71 on family resemblance). The author's claim that \"人类不仅永远无法真正知道其他人的真实想法\" anticipates the private language considerations developed more fully in later essays.\n   338→\n   339→### A Thought on Knowledge\n   340→This essay is the most directly relevant to analytic epistemology and to *On Certainty*. The systematic stripping away of JTB components is clear and effective. The approach of focusing on \"how we access\" justification bases rather than \"what they are\" is thoroughly Wittgensteinian in spirit.\n   341→\n   342→### 西西弗斯、班与猫\n   343→The dissolution of absurdism through the concept of internally generated meaning (养猫) is philosophically elegant. From a Wittgensteinian perspective, the key insight is that meaning does not require articulation or justification --- the cat-owner does not need to state *why* cat care is meaningful. This resonates with Wittgenstein's observation that forms of life do not require external justification; they are the given.\n   344→\n   345→### 后形而上学 整理\n   346→The layered analysis of metaphysics (Types 0-3) and the \"inversion\" of 道德仁义礼 is sophisticated. The concept of 恒常 as the core of metaphysical thinking is a genuine contribution. The distinction between 第一实在 (phenomena) and 第二实在 (constructed reality) maps partially onto Wittgenstein's distinction between what is given and what is constructed in language, though the author's framework is more explicitly ontological.\n   347→\n   348→### 形而上学后的目的：诗意\n   349→The distinction between 沉醉 (immersed) and 清醒 (lucid) dreamscapes is philosophically original. It offers a way of being meaning-engaged that is neither naive (pre-critical) nor nihilistic (post-critical). This has no direct Wittgensteinian parallel but is consistent with the later Wittgenstein's acceptance of forms of life as \"the given.\"\n   350→\n   351→### 范畴论与境 整理\n   352→This is where the formal apparatus is developed. The identification of associations (联想) with morphisms, and the tower structure of experience, are the framework's most technically innovative features. The examples (Ship of Theseus, \"what is a person?\", dragon's blood) effectively illustrate how the formal tools apply to traditional philosophical problems.\n   353→\n   354→### 范畴论与境：K1策略\n   355→This is the framework's culminating essay. The natural transformation analysis of understanding, the structural verification criterion, and the proposal for philosophical experiments are the most philosophically significant contributions. The explicit engagement with language games and philosophical therapy shows the author's awareness of the Wittgensteinian tradition.\n   356→\n   357→### 关于诗意和境的一些零散想法\n   358→This collection of notes extends and applies the framework. The self-referential observation that we are already constructing 境 in everyday life --- choosing clothes, decorating rooms, taking photographs --- grounds the abstract framework in lived practice, which is the most Wittgensteinian gesture in the entire collection.\n   359→\n   360→---\n   361→\n   362→## Supplementary Analysis: Two Follow-Up Topics\n   363→\n   364→### S1. Intersubjectivity via the Natural Transformation $\\eta$\n   365→\n   366→The author suggests that the natural transformation $\\eta$ is the mechanism through which intersubjective verification is possible. Let me trace how this works and assess it from a Wittgensteinian perspective.\n   367→\n   368→#### The Mechanism\n   369→\n   370→Consider two people, Alice and Bob, both reading the sentence \"The cat jumped on the table\" (猫跳上了桌子). In K1策略, understanding this sentence requires a natural transformation between the sentence's structural evolution (its syntactic unfolding) and one's experiential evolution (the mental simulation of the event). If Alice has an $\\eta^A$ and Bob has an $\\eta^B$, the question of intersubjectivity becomes: do Alice and Bob understand the same thing?\n   371→\n   372→The author's answer (K1策略 methodology point 3) is that we do not need ontological verification that $\\eta^A$ and $\\eta^B$ are qualitatively identical --- we need only that they occupy the same **structural position**. That is, if Alice's $\\eta^A$ relates the same objects and morphisms in the same way as Bob's $\\eta^B$, then their understanding is commensurable.\n   373→\n   374→More precisely: the naturality condition requires that $\\eta$ commutes with all morphisms in the source category. This means $\\eta$ is not a free-floating subjective response but a **structurally constrained** response. Two people whose $\\eta$'s satisfy the same naturality diagrams are, in a rigorous mathematical sense, aligned --- even if the \"felt quality\" of their $\\eta$'s differs. The commutative diagram itself is the public, shareable criterion of understanding.\n   375→\n   376→#### Wittgensteinian Assessment\n   377→\n   378→This is, I believe, the most philosophically significant move in the entire collection, and it represents a **genuine advance** on the intersubjectivity problem that goes beyond what Wittgenstein himself achieved. Here is why.\n   379→\n   380→Wittgenstein's treatment of intersubjectivity operates on two levels:\n   381→\n   382→1. **The Private Language Argument (PI sections 243--315)**: Meaning must be public. The \"beetle in the box\" thought experiment (PI section 293) shows that if everyone has a box with something in it that only they can see, the \"something\" drops out of the language game --- what matters is the *role* of \"beetle\" in our shared practice, not its private content.\n   383→\n   384→2. **Agreement in Form of Life (PI section 241)**: \"So you are saying that human agreement decides what is true and what is false?\" --- \"It is what human beings *say* that is true and false; and they agree in the *language* they use. That is not agreement in opinions but in form of life.\"\n   385→\n   386→Wittgenstein establishes that meaning is public and that intersubjective agreement is grounded in shared form of life. But he does not provide a **mechanism** for how this works. He would resist providing one, on therapeutic grounds --- the question \"how does intersubjective understanding work?\" is, for the quietist, already a confused question (understanding is not a process; cf. PI section 154).\n   387→\n   388→The author's natural transformation framework provides what Wittgenstein deliberately withholds: a **positive structural account** of intersubjective alignment. The key insight is that **the naturality condition is itself the public criterion**. Consider:\n   389→\n   390→- The naturality square for $\\eta$ is a mathematical structure that can be checked, tested, and communicated.\n   391→- Two people who both satisfy the naturality condition for the same source category are provably aligned in their structural responses.\n   392→- This alignment does not require access to anyone's private experience --- it requires only that both people's responses are coherent with the same categorical structure.\n   393→\n   394→This is precisely analogous to Wittgenstein's beetle-in-the-box: the private content ($\\eta^A$ vs $\\eta^B$ as felt experiences) drops out; what remains is the structural role ($\\eta$ as a natural transformation satisfying commutative diagrams). The author has given **mathematical content** to the beetle-in-the-box insight.\n   395→\n   396→Furthermore, the naturality condition addresses the **Kripkenstein problem** (Kripke's skeptical reading of Wittgenstein on rule-following). Kripke asks: what fact about me determines that I mean addition rather than \"quaddition\" by \"+\"? The author's framework suggests an answer: the fact that my $\\eta$ satisfies the naturality condition for the categorical structure of arithmetic. If my $\\eta$ is natural (commutes with all morphisms), then my understanding is structurally determined --- there is no room for quaddition-like deviance, because the naturality condition constrains $\\eta$ globally, not just at finitely many points. This is not Kripke's \"skeptical solution\" (meaning as community agreement) but something closer to a **structural solution**: meaning is fixed by the naturality constraint itself.\n   397→\n   398→However, a Wittgensteinian would raise the following concern: **who verifies the naturality condition?** If Alice checks whether Bob's $\\eta$ commutes with all morphisms, she must access Bob's $\\eta$ --- which is, by hypothesis, an experience in Bob's $\\mathbb{E}$. The author's response would presumably be the philosophical experiment methodology: construct situations designed to test whether specific components of $\\eta$ are present, and check for replicable behavioral responses. This converts the naturality check into an empirical procedure, which is consistent with Wittgenstein's emphasis on practice. But it also shows that **intersubjective verification is always partial and practical** --- we can check finitely many components of $\\eta$ through experiments, but we can never verify the full naturality condition. This partial, practical character is, I think, exactly right, and it is exactly what Wittgenstein would predict: agreement is always agreement in what we *do*, not in some metaphysical fact about shared understanding.\n   399→\n   400→**Key conclusion**: The natural transformation $\\eta$ provides a **structural criterion for intersubjective commensurability** that is (1) consistent with the private language argument's conclusion that meaning is public, (2) more specific than Wittgenstein's appeal to \"agreement in form of life,\" and (3) potentially testable through the philosophical experiment methodology. This is a genuine contribution to philosophy of language.\n   401→\n   402→#### Translation Note (Addendum to Dictionary)\n   403→\n   404→The term 主体间性 should be translated as **intersubjectivity**. In the author's framework, intersubjectivity is not grounded in empathy, shared consciousness, or transcendental structures, but in **structural commensurability** --- the sharing of naturality conditions. This is distinct from Husserl's intersubjectivity (grounded in empathic appresentation), Habermas's (grounded in communicative rationality), and Wittgenstein's (grounded in agreement in form of life). The author's is perhaps closest to Brandom's inferentialism, where intersubjectivity is constituted by the mutual recognition of inferential commitments.\n   405→\n   406→---\n   407→\n   408→### S2. The Essays as Philosophical Experiments\n   409→\n   410→The author proposes that \"philosophical experiments\" consist in constructing examples with specific structures to awaken specific experiences in readers, then checking whether those experiences are replicable (K1策略, methodology point 3). The author further suggests in \"写在最后\" that this practice is already ubiquitous: poetry, literature, art, music, games, memes, and even decorating one's room are all instances of constructing 境 to awaken experience.\n   411→\n   412→Re-reading the essays with this lens reveals that **several passages are indeed functioning as philosophical experiments** --- they are not merely *describing* philosophical positions but are actively *constructing* experiential structures in the reader. Let me identify the most significant instances.\n   413→\n   414→#### Experiment 1: The Sisyphus/Cat Essay as Dissolution of Absurdity\n   415→\n   416→The essay 西西弗斯、班与猫 has a very specific argumentative structure that functions as a philosophical experiment:\n   417→\n   418→1. **Setup (establishing the target experience)**: The reader is invited to feel the absurdity of Sisyphus's situation, and then the absurdity of the office worker's situation. These are familiar scenarios; most readers will have a pre-existing $\\eta$ that connects \"repetitive labor\" with \"absurdity.\"\n   419→\n   420→2. **Pivot (disrupting the structural alignment)**: The author introduces the entrepreneur --- structurally identical labor, but no absurdity. This forces the reader to notice that their $\\eta$ between \"repetition\" and \"absurdity\" was not intrinsic but contingent on **alienation** (the meaning being external).\n   421→\n   422→3. **Dissolution (constructing a new $\\eta$)**: The cat example. Here the author constructs a scenario that is structurally identical to Sisyphus (repetitive, effortful, no cosmic purpose) but where the experience of absurdity is simply **absent**. The rhetorical force of this example depends on the reader *actually experiencing* the absence of absurdity when thinking about cat care. The sentence \"没有一个养猫的人会感到荒谬，荒谬从未来过\" is designed to trigger the reader's introspective verification: *Is this true? Do I feel absurdity when I think about caring for a cat?* The expected answer is no, and this no is itself the philosophical experiment's result.\n   423→\n   424→From a Wittgensteinian perspective, this is a paradigmatic example of **philosophical therapy conducted through examples** --- exactly what Wittgenstein does in the *Investigations*. Consider PI section 66, where Wittgenstein asks the reader to \"look and see\" whether there is something common to all games. The rhetorical structure is identical: Wittgenstein constructs a series of examples, invites the reader to introspect, and expects a specific experiential result (the *absence* of a common feature). The cat example works the same way: the author constructs a scenario, invites introspection, and expects the *absence* of absurdity.\n   425→\n   426→What makes this a philosophical *experiment* rather than merely a philosophical *argument* is that **the reader's introspective response is the evidence**. If the reader *does* feel absurdity when thinking about cat care, the experiment has failed for that reader, and the philosophical claim is not established. The claim is empirical-experiential, not logically necessary.\n   427→\n   428→This is genuinely Wittgensteinian in method, even if the author's framework provides a more structural account of *why* the method works (the examples construct specific categorical structures that do or do not support a natural transformation involving \"absurdity\").\n   429→\n   430→#### Experiment 2: The 道德仁义礼 Reversal as Restructuring of the Reader's 境\n   431→\n   432→The 道德仁义礼 passage in 后形而上学 整理 functions as a different kind of philosophical experiment --- one aimed at **restructuring** the reader's 境 rather than dissolving a specific feeling.\n   433→\n   434→The passage proceeds in several steps:\n   435→\n   436→1. **The traditional ordering is presented**: 道 -> 德 -> 仁 -> 义 -> 礼. This is the familiar top-down metaphysical picture. Most readers educated in Chinese philosophy will have an existing $\\eta$ aligning this ordering with their understanding of the concepts.\n   437→\n   438→2. **The author introduces \"现象礼\"**: The reader is asked to recall the actual *experience* of ritual behavior --- how it feels, from the inside, to behave ritually toward others. This is a request for introspection.\n   439→\n   440→3. **The reversal is performed step by step**: 现象礼 -> 现象义 -> 现象仁 -> 德 -> 道. Each step is justified by appeal to the reader's own experience: \"this feeling is what you actually experience\" (切实感受到的). The reader is being guided through a reconstruction of their own experiential categories.\n   441→\n   442→4. **The inversion is made explicit**: \"整个逻辑的顺序就被倒反过来.\" The reader is invited to experience the *shift* --- the moment when the traditional ordering \"flips\" and the reader sees that what they took to be foundational (道) was actually derived (from 现象礼).\n   443→\n   444→From a Wittgensteinian perspective, this is a **perspicuous presentation** (*ubersichtliche Darstellung*, PI section 122) --- a rearrangement of what was already known that produces a new way of seeing. Wittgenstein's own method in the *Investigations* is precisely this: he does not introduce new facts but rearranges familiar facts so that we see them differently. The duck-rabbit (PI p. 194) is the iconic example: the same figure, seen differently.\n   445→\n   446→But the 道德仁义礼 passage is more than a static perspicuous presentation --- it is a **guided restructuring** of the reader's experiential categories. The reader's $\\mathcal{E}$ is being actively reorganized: the meta-order of 道, 德, 仁, 义, 礼 is being inverted. If the experiment succeeds, the reader emerges with a different categorical structure --- one where phenomena are foundational and metaphysical concepts are derived. This is a restructuring of the reader's 境 itself.\n   447→\n   448→This is something Wittgenstein does implicitly but never theorizes. The author, by providing the category-theoretic framework, can now describe *what happens* when a philosophical example restructures one's understanding: it changes the meta-ordering of objects in $\\mathcal{E}$, potentially changing which objects serve as universal properties, and thereby changing the reader's metaphysical commitments.\n   449→\n   450→#### Experiment 3: The \"1+1=2\" Passage as Evoking $\\eta$\n   451→\n   452→In K1策略, the passage where the author asks the reader to introspect on the experience of understanding \"1+1=2\" is itself a philosophical experiment. The reader is asked:\n   453→\n   454→- Do you experience a \"direct confirmation sense\" when you see \"1+1=2\"?\n   455→- Is this different from the experience of checking your answer against a reference?\n   456→- Can you recognize the experience of $\\eta$ as identity (掌握) versus $\\eta$ as non-trivial (理解 without 掌握)?\n   457→\n   458→The passage about the meme sentence \"你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国，记住我给出的原理\" is particularly effective: the reader is asked to notice the *failure* of $\\eta$ --- the experience of **not understanding** despite grammatical correctness. This negative result (the absence of alignment) is just as experimentally significant as the positive case.\n   459→\n   460→#### Experiment 4: The 忒修斯之船 (Ship of Theseus) as Evoking the Universal Property\n   461→\n   462→In 范畴论与境 整理, the Ship of Theseus discussion asks the reader to introspect: \"When you think of the Ship of Theseus, what do you experience?\" The expected answer is a specific *feeling* --- the feeling that accompanies the concept of this particular ship, which is the universal property of the sub-category $\\mathcal{E}_{\\text{Theseus}}$. The author then shows that choosing $\\mathfrak{P}$ as the physical world leads to the paradox (the universal property becomes \"emptiness\"), while choosing $\\mathfrak{P}$ as phenomena resolves it (the universal property is the *feeling* of \"this ship\"). The reader is invited to verify this through introspection: \"Is the identity of the Ship of Theseus located in the physical planks or in my experience of the ship?\"\n   463→\n   464→#### Wittgensteinian Assessment of the Experimental Method\n   465→\n   466→Wittgenstein would have a complex reaction to the philosophical experiment methodology:\n   467→\n   468→**What he would endorse**: The centrality of concrete examples, the appeal to introspective verification, the refusal to argue from abstract principles alone. These are all Wittgensteinian virtues. PI section 593: \"A main cause of philosophical disease --- a one-sided diet: one nourishes one's thinking with only one kind of example.\"\n   469→\n   470→**What he would resist**: The idea that introspective responses can be treated as *data* for a structural theory. For Wittgenstein, the examples are **self-sufficient** --- they do not serve a higher theoretical purpose. They are not evidence for a theory about natural transformations; they are the thing itself. The moment you treat introspective responses as data points in a structural theory, you have, from Wittgenstein's perspective, taken a step away from the phenomena and toward a philosophical construction.\n   471→\n   472→**What is genuinely new**: The author's key innovation is the claim that philosophical experiments can be designed *in advance* by specifying the categorical structure that should evoke the target experience. This is the reverse of Wittgenstein's method: Wittgenstein finds examples that dissolve existing confusions; the author proposes to *construct* examples that produce *specific predicted* experiences. This is a move from therapeutic philosophy to what we might call **constructive experimental phenomenology**. It has no precedent in Wittgenstein, though it has affinities with Austin's method of constructing specific speech-act scenarios to test linguistic intuitions. (Austin also believed that carefully constructed examples could serve as evidence for philosophical claims about language.)\n   473→\n   474→**The deepest insight**: The author's observation that the essays *themselves* are philosophical experiments --- not just descriptions of a theory but active interventions in the reader's experiential structure --- collapses the distinction between philosophical writing and philosophical practice. This is actually the most Wittgensteinian thing in the entire collection, because it embodies Wittgenstein's claim that philosophy is an *activity* (Tractatus 4.112), not a body of doctrine. The essays do not merely *say* that meaning is experiential alignment; they *show* it by constructing experiences in the reader. The medium is the message. This is philosophy as performance, as practice --- which is, in the end, what Wittgenstein always insisted philosophy should be.\n   475→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

Language Games in the Framework\n\n### The Author's Usage of 语言游戏 (Language Games)\n\nIn K1策略, the author explicitly invokes the concept of 语言游戏 (language games) as a method for investigating stable structures ($S_L$) within the linguistic sub-category $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$. The key passage states:\n\n> \"于是我们就可以通过语言游戏研究语言演化中的稳定结构 $S_L$，来间接获得对 $\\mathbb{E}_t$ 中 $S_E$ 的认识\"\n\nThis usage represents a **productive but significantly reoriented extension** of Wittgenstein's concept. In the *Philosophical Investigations*, language games serve multiple functions: they are simplified models of language use (PI section 2), they illustrate the multiplicity and heterogeneity of linguistic practices (PI section 23), and they are bound up with \"forms of life\" (PI section 23). Crucially, for Wittgenstein, language games are **not instruments for discovering underlying structures**. They are the thing itself --- the level at which meaning operates. There is no deeper structure that language games reveal; rather, language games *are* the bedrock.\n\nThe author, by contrast, treats language games as **probes** --- methodological instruments that, through the functor $(F_{E,L})_t$, can map linguistic stable structures onto experiential stable structures. This is closer to what we might call a **constructive-structuralist** appropriation of language games. Wittgenstein would likely resist this move, since for him the idea that language games reveal hidden invariants would itself be a philosophical confusion --- the very kind of theorizing he sought to dissolve.\n\nHowever, the author's framework is more subtle than a naive structuralism. The author acknowledges that the mapping $(F_{E,L})_t(S_L) \\approx S_E$ is only approximate, that it captures at best a partial overlap, and that the relationship is descriptive rather than constitutive. This qualification brings the author somewhat closer to Wittgenstein's therapeutic spirit: the framework does not claim to have found the *essence* of meaning, but rather offers a tool for mapping certain structural relationships.\n\n### Therapeutic vs. Constructive Conceptions\n\nWittgenstein's conception of philosophy is famously therapeutic: \"The philosopher treats a question; like an illness\" (PI section 255). The aim is not to construct theories but to dissolve confusions by achieving a \"perspicuous presentation\" (*ubersichtliche Darstellung*, PI section 122). PI section 133 states: \"The real discovery is the one that enables me to break off doing philosophy when I want to.\"\n\nThe author explicitly mentions 哲学治疗 (philosophical therapy) in K1策略 and claims that the framework explains why it works --- roughly, through the resolution of \"tension\" (张力) when experiential sub-categories lack a well-defined universal property. This is a **structural explanation of why therapy works**, which is itself a constructive philosophical move. Wittgenstein would not attempt to explain *why* therapy works in structural-mathematical terms; for him, the therapy works by showing us the way out of the fly-bottle (PI section 309), not by constructing a formal account of fly-bottles.\n\n**Assessment**: The author's use of language games is a **departure** from Wittgenstein's anti-theoretical stance, but it is a **self-aware departure**. The author does not claim to be doing what Wittgenstein did; rather, the author uses Wittgenstein's concept as one input among many in a constructive framework. This is closer to how Robert Brandom appropriates Wittgenstein --- taking the insight about the primacy of practice and embedding it within a systematic philosophical project --- than to the quietist reading of Wittgenstein associated with Cora Diamond and James Conant.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Meaning and Structure: 是结构先于意义，还是意义先于结构？\n\n### The Author's Resolution via Natural Transformations\n\nIn K1策略, the author asks: does structure precede meaning, or meaning precede structure? The resolution is given through the natural transformation framework:\n\n> \"结构和意义之间的关系是自然变换：一句话能够被理解，他必须能够在心理过程的演化和结构的演化中达成如上所述的这种一致性感受$\\eta$\"\n\nThis is a striking move. The author refuses the dichotomy by arguing that structure and meaning are related by a **natural transformation** --- neither generates the other, but they must be **aligned**. Understanding ($\\eta$) is precisely the experience of this alignment.\n\n### Relation to Wittgenstein's Meaning-as-Use\n\nWittgenstein's meaning-as-use thesis (PI section 43: \"the meaning of a word is its use in the language\") dissolves the structure/meaning dichotomy from a different direction. For Wittgenstein, there is no pre-linguistic meaning that structure then encodes, nor is there a pure structure that then generates meaning. Meaning simply *is* the pattern of use within a language game embedded in a form of life.\n\nThe author's framework can be read as a **formalization of why Wittgenstein's dissolution works**. If structure and meaning are related by natural transformation rather than by generation, then asking which comes first is indeed a confused question --- just as Wittgenstein suggests. The natural transformation framework gives mathematical content to the Wittgensteinian insight that meaning and use are co-constitutive.\n\nHowever, there is a crucial difference. For Wittgenstein, meaning-as-use is meant to *stop* philosophical theorizing about meaning. The point is that once we see that meaning is use, there is nothing further to explain. The author, by contrast, uses the dissolution of the dichotomy as a *starting point* for further structural analysis. This is characteristic of the author's general approach: taking Wittgensteinian therapeutic insights and converting them into constructive theoretical resources.\n\n### Contrast with Formal Semantics\n\nIn truth-conditional formal semantics (Montague, Davidson, Tarski), meaning is identified with truth-conditions, and structure (syntactic/logical form) determines meaning via compositional rules. This is a clear \"structure precedes meaning\" position. The author's framework differs from this in several ways:\n\n1. **No appeal to truth**: The author's framework, consistent with the Knowledge essay, does not invoke truth-conditions. Meaning is experiential alignment ($\\eta$), not truth-value assignment.\n2. **Bidirectionality**: Formal semantics maps structure to meaning; the author's natural transformation allows influence in both directions.\n3. **Dynamic character**: Formal semantics is typically static (a sentence has its meaning at a time); the author's framework is inherently evolutionary ($t \\to t+1$).\n\nThe author's position has more in common with **dynamic semantics** (Kamp, Heim, Groenendijk & Stokhof) and with **inferentialist semantics** (Brandom), where meaning is constituted by inferential role and responsive to context, than with classical Montague grammar.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The Picture Theory and Natural Transformations\n\n### Tractatus Picture Theory\n\nThe early Wittgenstein's picture theory (Tractatus 2.1--2.225) posits that propositions are pictures of reality. A picture shares \"logical form\" with what it depicts (T 2.18). The picture \"reaches up to reality\" (T 2.1511) through a structural isomorphism between the elements of the picture and the elements of the state of affairs.\n\n### The Author's Natural Transformation Framework\n\nThe author's framework posits that understanding occurs when the evolution of a formal structure (e.g., mathematics, language) and the evolution of experience are related by a natural transformation. The $\\eta_a$ component measures the alignment between two paths from structure to experience.\n\n### Comparison\n\nThere is a **genuine structural parallel**. Both frameworks posit that the relationship between language/formalism and reality/experience is mediated by **structural correspondence**. However, the differences are substantial:\n\n| Feature | Tractatus Picture Theory | Author's Framework |\n|---|---|---|\n| Correspondence type | Isomorphism (static) | Natural transformation (dynamic) |\n| What corresponds | Proposition and state of affairs | Structural evolution and experiential evolution |\n| Nature of correspondence | Logical form shared | Alignment ($\\eta$) experienced |\n| Status of correspondence | Metaphysical necessity | Empirical/experiential claim |\n| Directionality | One-way (picture depicts) | Bidirectional (natural transformation) |\n\nThe author's framework can be read as a **category-theoretic generalization** of the picture theory in the following precise sense: where the Tractatus requires a *single* structural isomorphism between a proposition and a fact, the author requires a *family* of morphisms ($\\eta_a$) that are *natural* (coherent across all objects and morphisms). The naturality condition is the key upgrade --- it captures not just point-by-point correspondence but **systematic coherence** across the entire categorical structure.\n\nMoreover, the author's framework **inherits the later Wittgenstein's corrections** to the picture theory. The Tractatus picture theory fails because it cannot account for the diversity of language uses (commands, jokes, prayers, greetings --- none of which \"picture\" anything). The author's framework avoids this by making the relevant correspondence *experiential* rather than *representational*. Understanding a joke is having the right $\\eta$ between the joke's structural unfolding and one's experiential response --- no picturing required.\n\n**Assessment**: The author's framework is best understood not as a generalization of the picture theory *per se*, but as a framework that **subsumes both** the picture theory (as a special case where $\\eta$ is an isomorphism) and the later Wittgenstein's meaning-as-use (as the general case where $\\eta$ captures experiential alignment).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Philosophical Therapy (哲学治疗)\n\n### The Author's Account\n\nIn K1策略, the author provides a structural account of why philosophical therapy works, centered on the concept of 张力 (tension) --- the state where a sub-category lacks a well-defined universal property, so that experience cannot resolve into a stable terminal point:\n\n> \"这也是哲学治疗为什么有效的原因\"\n\nThe author connects this to the idea that philosophical puzzlement arises from structural tension --- multiple potential universal properties competing without resolution --- and that therapy works by restructuring the category so that the tension is resolved.\n\n### Wittgenstein's Therapeutic Conception\n\nFor Wittgenstein, philosophical problems arise from linguistic confusions: \"philosophical problems arise when language goes on holiday\" (PI section 38). Therapy consists in \"assembling reminders for a particular purpose\" (PI section 127) --- drawing attention to how words are actually used so that the confused philosopher can see that there was no genuine problem.\n\n### The Tension\n\nThe author's account **explains** why therapy works; Wittgenstein would regard such an explanation as itself a philosophical confusion. Wittgenstein explicitly rejects the idea that philosophy should produce theories (PI section 109: \"we may not advance any kind of theory\"). For Wittgenstein, the therapeutic effect is self-evident once the confusion is cleared; there is nothing further to explain.\n\nHowever, the author's account does something that Wittgenstein's does not: it provides a **positive criterion** for when philosophical puzzlement should arise and when it should be resolved. By identifying puzzlement with categorical tension, the author can (in principle) predict which conceptual configurations will produce confusion and which will not. This is a genuinely productive extension, even if it violates Wittgenstein's quietism.\n\nFurthermore, the author's framework offers an interesting **bridge** between Wittgenstein's therapeutic approach and more constructive philosophical programs. If therapy works by resolving categorical tension, then constructive philosophy (building new frameworks, new concepts) is *also* a form of therapy --- it resolves tension not by showing that the question was confused, but by providing new categorical structure in which the tension can be resolved. This is close to what the author describes as the construction of 境.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Rule-Following and 恒常 (Constancy)\n\n### The Author's Account of Stable Structures\n\nThe concept of 恒常 (constancy) is introduced in 后形而上学 整理 as the core of metaphysical thinking:\n\n> \"形而上的核心是恒常。我们需要在变化的现象之中寻找到（追求）一种恒常性\"\n\nIn K1策略, this is formalized as stable structures $S_E$ preserved under the evolution functor $T$. The idea is that certain structural features of experience are invariant under experiential evolution --- they are the \"rules\" that constrain how experience can develop.\n\n### Wittgenstein's Rule-Following\n\nWittgenstein's rule-following considerations (PI sections 138--242) constitute one of the most profound and difficult passages in 20th-century philosophy. The central problem is: what constitutes following a rule? Wittgenstein argues against any **mentalist** or **Platonist** account of rules. A rule is not a mental state that determines its applications, nor is it an abstract object that we grasp. Rather, rule-following is a *practice* --- it consists in the regularity of a community's behavior, and there is no deeper fact that makes the behavior count as following *this* rule rather than *that* one.\n\nThe Kripkenstein paradox (Kripke's reading of Wittgenstein) sharpens this: for any finite sequence of applications, there are infinitely many rules consistent with that sequence. What determines that we are following addition rather than \"quaddition\"?\n\n### Comparison\n\nThe author's formalization of constancy as functorial invariance is in tension with Wittgenstein's anti-formalism in several ways:\n\n1. **Formalization vs. practice**: The author treats rules as mathematical invariants ($S_E$ preserved under $T$); Wittgenstein insists that rules are constituted by practice, not by any formal structure.\n\n2. **Community vs. individual**: Wittgenstein's rule-following requires a community of practitioners; the author's framework is largely individualistic (analyzing the evolution of a single person's $\\mathbb{E}_t$).\n\n3. **Determinacy**: The author's $S_E$ is (in principle) mathematically determinate; Wittgenstein argues that there is no fact of the matter about which rule is being followed apart from practice.\n\nHowever, the author's framework also has **surprising resonances** with Wittgenstein:\n\n1. **No ground-level rules**: The author explicitly states that $S_E$ is descriptive, not constitutive. The stable structures are observed regularities, not prescriptive rules. This is actually close to Wittgenstein's point: the \"rule\" is what we observe in practice, not a Platonic entity.\n\n2. **Non-uniqueness**: The author acknowledges that different choices of sub-categories and different time-ranges will yield different $S_E$. This echoes Wittgenstein's point that rule-following is context-dependent and community-relative.\n\n3. **The role of agreement**: When the author discusses philosophical experiments and the possibility of evoking shared experiences across different people, the criterion of success is structural agreement --- \"只需要他们具有相同的结构性位置.\" This is remarkably close to Wittgenstein's emphasis on \"agreement in form of life\" (PI section 241) as the basis for following the same rule.\n\n**Assessment**: The author formalizes what Wittgenstein deliberately left un-formalized. Whether this is a productive move or a misunderstanding depends on one's reading of Wittgenstein. On a therapeutic reading, it is a confusion. On a constructive reading (closer to Brandom or McDowell), it is a legitimate extension that preserves the anti-Platonist and practice-oriented spirit while adding mathematical precision.\n\n---\n\n## 6. On Certainty and the Knowledge Essay\n\n### The Author's Argument\n\nIn \"A Thought on Knowledge,\" the author argues that knowledge reduces to belief by analyzing each component of the traditional justified true belief (JTB) definition:\n\n1. **Truth condition**: methodologically impossible --- we have access only to phenomena, never to truth directly.\n2. **Justification condition**: all justification ultimately rests on phenomena or beliefs; phenomena must be \"digested\" into beliefs to be used; therefore justification is ultimately belief about belief.\n3. **Conclusion**: knowledge is, in practice, \"what each individual believes to be correct.\"\n\n### Wittgenstein's On Certainty\n\n*On Certainty* (OC), written in the last months of Wittgenstein's life, addresses Moore's \"proof of the external world.\" Wittgenstein argues that certain propositions function not as items of knowledge but as **hinge propositions** --- they are the framework within which knowledge claims, doubts, and justifications operate. \"The questions that we raise and our doubts depend on the fact that some propositions are exempt from doubt, as it were like hinges on which those turn\" (OC section 341).\n\nKey features of hinge propositions:\n- They are not known in the traditional sense; they are the **conditions** for knowing (OC section 403).\n- They cannot be justified, but this does not make them arbitrary (OC section 559).\n- They belong to a \"system\" or \"world-picture\" (*Weltbild*) (OC section 162).\n- They can change over time as practices change (OC section 96).\n\n### Connection\n\nThe author's analysis and Wittgenstein's *On Certainty* arrive at strikingly similar conclusions through different routes:\n\n1. **Foundationalism fails**: The author shows that justification bottoms out in unjustified belief or circular justification. Wittgenstein shows that justification bottoms out in hinge propositions that are not themselves justified.\n\n2. **Practice over theory**: The author repeatedly emphasizes \"in practice\" (在实践中) --- what people actually do when they claim to know something. Wittgenstein similarly focuses on what Moore *actually does* when he says \"I know this is a hand.\"\n\n3. **Knowledge as communal standard**: The author proposes that knowledge is \"what most people in a field believe to be correct.\" Wittgenstein's world-picture is similarly communal and practice-embedded.\n\n4. **Historical contingency**: The author notes that knowledge \"changes over time (e.g., geocentrism).\" Wittgenstein explicitly allows that hinge propositions can shift (OC section 96--99).\n\nHowever, there is a significant difference. Wittgenstein would resist the reduction of knowledge to belief. For Wittgenstein, hinge propositions are **neither** known **nor** believed --- they are the framework within which the distinction between knowledge and belief operates. The author's move is more radical: dissolving the knowledge/belief distinction entirely. This is closer to **pragmatism** (James, Dewey, Rorty) than to Wittgenstein, who preserves the grammar of \"knowing\" and \"believing\" even as he transforms their philosophical significance.\n\nThe author's analysis of scientific knowledge through the lens of high-energy physics (where \"fundamental particles\" are never directly observed, only electromagnetic signals in detectors that are then reconstructed through models) is particularly compelling and parallels Wittgenstein's observation in OC section 105: \"All testing, all confirmation and disconfirmation of a hypothesis takes place already within a system.\"\n\n---\n\n## 7. Private Language and Intersubjectivity\n\n### The Author's Position\n\nAcross the essays, the author repeatedly argues that we cannot access others' inner states:\n\n> \"人类不仅永远无法真正知道其他人的真实想法\" (关于集体利益)\n\n> \"我无法真正感受到他人的内心感受\" (后形而上学 整理)\n\nYet the author proposes a criterion for communication and intersubjective verification:\n\n> \"我们不需要本体论的验证不同的人获得了'同一'体验（例如Qualia），只需要他们具有相同的结构性位置\" (K1策略)\n\n### Wittgenstein's Private Language Argument\n\nWittgenstein's private language argument (PI sections 243--315) argues that a language whose terms refer to the speaker's private sensations, knowable only to the speaker, is impossible. The key moves:\n\n1. A private linguist cannot establish a criterion of correctness for their sensation-terms (PI section 258).\n2. Without such a criterion, there is no distinction between following a rule and merely thinking one is following a rule (PI section 202).\n3. Therefore, the meaning of sensation-terms must be grounded in public, shared practices.\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe author's position is **deeply compatible** with the private language argument, perhaps more than the author realizes. Consider:\n\n1. **Structural position as public criterion**: The author's proposal that shared experience is verified by \"structural position\" rather than by qualitative identity is exactly the kind of **public criterion** that Wittgenstein argues sensation-terms must have. We don't need to verify that your red *feels* the same as my red; we need only verify that \"red\" occupies the same structural position in both our linguistic/experiential networks.\n\n2. **Rejection of private access**: The author's insistence that we cannot know others' inner states, combined with the claim that structural verification suffices for communication, mirrors Wittgenstein's point that the \"private object\" drops out as irrelevant to meaning (PI section 293, the \"beetle in the box\" passage).\n\n3. **Category-theoretic formalization**: The author's framework provides a precise mathematical formulation of what \"same structural position\" means: isomorphic placement within a categorical structure. This goes beyond what Wittgenstein offers but is entirely consistent with his philosophical conclusions.\n\nWhere the author diverges from Wittgenstein is in maintaining that there genuinely *are* inner states that we cannot access --- the framework preserves subjective experience as ontologically real even if epistemically inaccessible. Wittgenstein, by contrast, argues that the very picture of \"inner states\" that others cannot access is confused: \"The essential thing about private experience is really not that each person possesses his own exemplar, but that nobody knows whether other people also have this or something else\" (PI section 272). For Wittgenstein, this \"not knowing\" is not an epistemic limitation but a grammatical observation --- the concept of \"knowing another's sensation\" has no clear application.\n\n**Assessment**: The author's structural verification criterion is one of the most philosophically productive ideas in the collection, and it can be read as a **constructive implementation** of Wittgenstein's insight that meaning is public. The category-theoretic apparatus provides precisely the tools needed to make \"same structural position\" rigorous.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Forms of Life and 境/梦境\n\n### Wittgenstein's Forms of Life (Lebensformen)\n\n\"Forms of life\" is one of the most evocative and under-determined concepts in Wittgenstein. It appears only a handful of times in the *Investigations* (PI sections 19, 23, 241; PI p. 226). Its precise meaning is debated, but the central idea is that language games are embedded in broader patterns of human activity, behavior, and agreement. \"To imagine a language means to imagine a form of life\" (PI section 19).\n\nForms of life are:\n- **Not reducible to rules or structures**: they include the \"weave of life\" --- behaviors, reactions, training, natural history.\n- **The given**: \"What has to be accepted, the given, is --- so one could say --- forms of life\" (PI p. 226).\n- **Neither subjective nor objective**: they are the shared background against which subjectivity and objectivity make sense.\n\n### The Author's 境 and 梦境\n\nThe author's 境 ($\\mathbb{E}$) is defined as a categorical structure on phenomena ($\\mathfrak{P}$): experiences as objects, associations (联想) as morphisms, forming a tower structure. 梦境 is the \"environment\" in which meaning becomes possible --- the \"packaging\" of experience within which purposes and significance arise.\n\n### Comparison\n\nThere are genuine parallels:\n\n1. **Background for meaning**: Both forms of life and 境 serve as the background against which meaning, understanding, and purpose operate. Neither is itself an object of direct scrutiny --- both are the medium *in which* we think and act.\n\n2. **Given-ness**: The author's insistence that we cannot escape all 境 (\"抛弃所有的梦境即是不可能的\") parallels Wittgenstein's claim that forms of life are \"the given.\"\n\n3. **Multiplicity**: The author allows for multiple sub-categories ($\\mathcal{E}_L$, $\\mathcal{E}_M$, $\\mathcal{E}_K$) within $\\mathbb{E}$; Wittgenstein allows for multiple, overlapping forms of life.\n\nHowever, the differences are also significant:\n\n1. **Formalization**: 境 is explicitly formalized using category theory; Wittgenstein's forms of life are deliberately left informal. Wittgenstein would likely regard the formalization as a category mistake --- forms of life are not the kind of thing that *can* be formalized, because they include precisely those aspects of human activity that resist formalization.\n\n2. **Individualism vs. communalism**: 境 is fundamentally individual (each person has their own $\\mathbb{E}_t$); forms of life are fundamentally communal (they are shared patterns of activity). This is a deep philosophical difference. The author addresses intersubjectivity through structural correspondence, but the starting point is the individual subject.\n\n3. **Static vs. dynamic**: The author's 境 evolves ($T_t: \\mathbb{E}_t \\to \\mathbb{E}_{t+1}$); Wittgenstein's forms of life are relatively stable (they change historically but are not theorized as evolving).\n\n4. **Dreamscape metaphor**: 梦境 (dreamscape) --- particularly the distinction between 沉醉 (immersed/intoxicated) and 清醒 (lucid/awake) --- introduces an element of **self-awareness** that has no direct parallel in Wittgenstein. The idea of a \"lucid dream\" where one is fully invested yet fully aware of the constructed nature of the meaning-structure goes beyond Wittgenstein's framework. This is more reminiscent of Heidegger's distinction between authentic and inauthentic existence, or of the Buddhist concept of mindfulness within samsara.\n\n**Assessment**: 境 is best understood not as a formalization of Wittgenstein's forms of life, but as a **parallel concept** developed from different philosophical motivations. Forms of life are the communal background of meaning; 境 is the individual structural medium of experience. The two concepts address overlapping philosophical territory but from different starting points and with different emphases.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Translation Challenges\n\n### Key Terms with Wittgensteinian Resonance\n\nThe following terms require careful handling in translation due to their proximity to --- but divergence from --- established Wittgensteinian terminology:\n\n**语言游戏 (language games)**: The standard translation of Wittgenstein's *Sprachspiele* is \"language games.\" The author uses the same Chinese term but with a different emphasis: as a methodological tool for discovering stable structures rather than as the bedrock of meaning. Translators should use \"language games\" but add a note distinguishing the author's usage from Wittgenstein's. Consider: \"language games (in the methodological sense)\" on first occurrence, then simply \"language games\" thereafter.\n\n**哲学治疗 (philosophical therapy)**: This translates straightforwardly as \"philosophical therapy,\" which is the standard rendering of Wittgenstein's concept. But since the author gives it a structural explanation (resolution of categorical tension), a translator's note should clarify the difference.\n\n**结构 (structure)** and **意义 (meaning)**: These are the central terms in the structure/meaning question. \"Structure\" and \"meaning\" are straightforward, but the translator should be aware that the author's use of \"meaning\" is experiential/phenomenological rather than truth-conditional or referential.\n\n**理解 (understanding) vs. 掌握 (mastery/grasp)**: This distinction is philosophically crucial. The author defines 掌握 as the special case where $\\eta_a$ is the identity --- a \"direct confirmation sense\" without mediation. This corresponds to what Wittgenstein calls \"understanding\" in its most robust sense. I recommend translating 理解 as \"understanding\" and 掌握 as \"mastery\" or \"direct grasp,\" with a note explaining that the latter is a technical term in the author's framework corresponding to the identity natural transformation.\n\n**恒常 (constancy)**: This is the author's term for the invariance at the heart of metaphysics. \"Constancy\" is adequate but risks confusion with Husserl's \"constancy\" (*Bestandigkeit*). \"Invariance\" captures the mathematical sense better, but \"constancy\" preserves the more phenomenological register. I recommend \"constancy\" with a parenthetical \"(invariance)\" on first occurrence.\n\n**境**: See the full dictionary entry below. This is the most challenging term.\n\n**规则 (rules)**: Standard translation. But note that the author's \"rules\" are stable structures ($S_E$), not Wittgensteinian rule-following practices.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Overall Significance\n\n### Does the Framework Achieve Something Wittgenstein Attempted?\n\nThe relationship between this framework and Wittgenstein's philosophy is best characterized as **complementary rather than duplicative**. Wittgenstein sought to dissolve philosophical problems by showing that they arise from linguistic confusions. The author seeks to **describe the structure of experience** in a way that makes philosophical problems tractable --- either dissolvable (by showing that they arise from categorical tension) or answerable (by mapping experiential structures through formal tools).\n\nThe deepest convergence is in the **anti-foundationalist** character of both projects:\n- Wittgenstein: there is no foundation beneath language games and forms of life; they are the given.\n- The author: there is no 第〇实在 (zeroth reality) accessible to us; phenomena are the 第一实在 (first reality), and all metaphysics is constructed *upon* phenomena.\n\nThe deepest divergence is in their attitudes toward **formalization**:\n- Wittgenstein: formalization is part of the disease, not the cure. Philosophical problems arise precisely from our attempt to force the richness of language use into formal molds.\n- The author: formalization (specifically, category theory) is a useful tool that, properly wielded, can illuminate the structure of experience without claiming to capture its essence.\n\n### Is the Category-Theoretic Formalization Productive?\n\nI believe it is, for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Natural transformations capture something real about understanding**. The idea that understanding is the alignment between structural evolution and experiential evolution, formalized as a natural transformation, is a genuinely illuminating philosophical proposal. It gives mathematical content to the vague notion of \"grasping\" meaning, and it does so in a way that is consistent with Wittgensteinian insights about the primacy of use and practice.\n\n2. **The structural verification criterion resolves a genuine problem**. Wittgenstein's private language argument establishes that meaning must be public, but it does not provide a positive account of *how* public meaning works. The author's structural position criterion fills this gap.\n\n3. **The framework is self-limiting**. The author repeatedly insists on the descriptive (rather than constitutive) character of the framework, and on the tool-like status of category theory. This self-limitation prevents the framework from falling into the kind of metaphysical dogmatism that Wittgenstein criticizes.\n\n4. **Connection to empirical verification**. The proposal for \"philosophical experiments\" --- constructing experiences with specific structural properties and verifying that they evoke the predicted experiential responses --- is a genuinely novel contribution to philosophical methodology. This goes beyond what Wittgenstein, the formal semanticists, or the speech act theorists have proposed.\n\nHowever, a Wittgensteinian critic would rightly note:\n- The framework may create new philosophical confusions even as it resolves old ones (e.g., reifying \"stable structures\" in experience).\n- The mathematical apparatus may obscure rather than illuminate for readers not trained in category theory.\n- The individualist starting point may miss the essentially communal character of meaning that Wittgenstein emphasizes.\n\n### Positioning in the Field\n\nWithin contemporary philosophy of language, this framework occupies a distinctive position:\n- It shares **inferentialism's** (Brandom) emphasis on structural relations over reference, but replaces inferential roles with categorical structures.\n- It shares **dynamic semantics'** emphasis on meaning as process, but operates at a more fundamental level (experience rather than discourse).\n- It shares **phenomenology's** (Husserl, Heidegger) emphasis on lived experience, but provides mathematical tools for structural analysis.\n- It inherits **Wittgenstein's** anti-foundationalism and emphasis on practice, but converts therapeutic insights into constructive resources.\n\nThe result is something genuinely new: a **structural phenomenology of meaning** that uses category theory as its formal backbone. Whether this will prove philosophically fruitful in the long run depends on whether the framework can generate specific, testable insights about the structure of understanding --- and the author's proposal for philosophical experiments suggests a path toward doing exactly that.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix: Notes on Individual Essays\n\n### 关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一\nFrom a philosophy of language perspective, the most interesting move here is the analogy between macro-level concepts (collective interest) and the renormalization group in physics. This parallels Wittgenstein's observation that concepts can operate at different \"levels\" without reducing to their micro-level constituents (cf. PI section 71 on family resemblance). The author's claim that \"人类不仅永远无法真正知道其他人的真实想法\" anticipates the private language considerations developed more fully in later essays.\n\n### A Thought on Knowledge\nThis essay is the most directly relevant to analytic epistemology and to *On Certainty*. The systematic stripping away of JTB components is clear and effective. The approach of focusing on \"how we access\" justification bases rather than \"what they are\" is thoroughly Wittgensteinian in spirit.\n\n### 西西弗斯、班与猫\nThe dissolution of absurdism through the concept of internally generated meaning (养猫) is philosophically elegant. From a Wittgensteinian perspective, the key insight is that meaning does not require articulation or justification --- the cat-owner does not need to state *why* cat care is meaningful. This resonates with Wittgenstein's observation that forms of life do not require external justification; they are the given.\n\n### 后形而上学 整理\nThe layered analysis of metaphysics (Types 0-3) and the \"inversion\" of 道德仁义礼 is sophisticated. The concept of 恒常 as the core of metaphysical thinking is a genuine contribution. The distinction between 第一实在 (phenomena) and 第二实在 (constructed reality) maps partially onto Wittgenstein's distinction between what is given and what is constructed in language, though the author's framework is more explicitly ontological.\n\n### 形而上学后的目的：诗意\nThe distinction between 沉醉 (immersed) and 清醒 (lucid) dreamscapes is philosophically original. It offers a way of being meaning-engaged that is neither naive (pre-critical) nor nihilistic (post-critical). This has no direct Wittgensteinian parallel but is consistent with the later Wittgenstein's acceptance of forms of life as \"the given.\"\n\n### 范畴论与境 整理\nThis is where the formal apparatus is developed. The identification of associations (联想) with morphisms, and the tower structure of experience, are the framework's most technically innovative features. The examples (Ship of Theseus, \"what is a person?\", dragon's blood) effectively illustrate how the formal tools apply to traditional philosophical problems.\n\n### 范畴论与境：K1策略\nThis is the framework's culminating essay. The natural transformation analysis of understanding, the structural verification criterion, and the proposal for philosophical experiments are the most philosophically significant contributions. The explicit engagement with language games and philosophical therapy shows the author's awareness of the Wittgensteinian tradition.\n\n### 关于诗意和境的一些零散想法\nThis collection of notes extends and applies the framework. The self-referential observation that we are already constructing 境 in everyday life --- choosing clothes, decorating rooms, taking photographs --- grounds the abstract framework in lived practice, which is the most Wittgensteinian gesture in the entire collection.\n\n---\n\n## Supplementary Analysis: Two Follow-Up Topics\n\n### S1. Intersubjectivity via the Natural Transformation $\\eta$\n\nThe author suggests that the natural transformation $\\eta$ is the mechanism through which intersubjective verification is possible. Let me trace how this works and assess it from a Wittgensteinian perspective.\n\n#### The Mechanism\n\nConsider two people, Alice and Bob, both reading the sentence \"The cat jumped on the table\" (猫跳上了桌子). In K1策略, understanding this sentence requires a natural transformation between the sentence's structural evolution (its syntactic unfolding) and one's experiential evolution (the mental simulation of the event). If Alice has an $\\eta^A$ and Bob has an $\\eta^B$, the question of intersubjectivity becomes: do Alice and Bob understand the same thing?\n\nThe author's answer (K1策略 methodology point 3) is that we do not need ontological verification that $\\eta^A$ and $\\eta^B$ are qualitatively identical --- we need only that they occupy the same **structural position**. That is, if Alice's $\\eta^A$ relates the same objects and morphisms in the same way as Bob's $\\eta^B$, then their understanding is commensurable.\n\nMore precisely: the naturality condition requires that $\\eta$ commutes with all morphisms in the source category. This means $\\eta$ is not a free-floating subjective response but a **structurally constrained** response. Two people whose $\\eta$'s satisfy the same naturality diagrams are, in a rigorous mathematical sense, aligned --- even if the \"felt quality\" of their $\\eta$'s differs. The commutative diagram itself is the public, shareable criterion of understanding.\n\n#### Wittgensteinian Assessment\n\nThis is, I believe, the most philosophically significant move in the entire collection, and it represents a **genuine advance** on the intersubjectivity problem that goes beyond what Wittgenstein himself achieved. Here is why.\n\nWittgenstein's treatment of intersubjectivity operates on two levels:\n\n1. **The Private Language Argument (PI sections 243--315)**: Meaning must be public. The \"beetle in the box\" thought experiment (PI section 293) shows that if everyone has a box with something in it that only they can see, the \"something\" drops out of the language game --- what matters is the *role* of \"beetle\" in our shared practice, not its private content.\n\n2. **Agreement in Form of Life (PI section 241)**: \"So you are saying that human agreement decides what is true and what is false?\" --- \"It is what human beings *say* that is true and false; and they agree in the *language* they use. That is not agreement in opinions but in form of life.\"\n\nWittgenstein establishes that meaning is public and that intersubjective agreement is grounded in shared form of life. But he does not provide a **mechanism** for how this works. He would resist providing one, on therapeutic grounds --- the question \"how does intersubjective understanding work?\" is, for the quietist, already a confused question (understanding is not a process; cf. PI section 154).\n\nThe author's natural transformation framework provides what Wittgenstein deliberately withholds: a **positive structural account** of intersubjective alignment. The key insight is that **the naturality condition is itself the public criterion**. Consider:\n\n- The naturality square for $\\eta$ is a mathematical structure that can be checked, tested, and communicated.\n- Two people who both satisfy the naturality condition for the same source category are provably aligned in their structural responses.\n- This alignment does not require access to anyone's private experience --- it requires only that both people's responses are coherent with the same categorical structure.\n\nThis is precisely analogous to Wittgenstein's beetle-in-the-box: the private content ($\\eta^A$ vs $\\eta^B$ as felt experiences) drops out; what remains is the structural role ($\\eta$ as a natural transformation satisfying commutative diagrams). The author has given **mathematical content** to the beetle-in-the-box insight.\n\nFurthermore, the naturality condition addresses the **Kripkenstein problem** (Kripke's skeptical reading of Wittgenstein on rule-following). Kripke asks: what fact about me determines that I mean addition rather than \"quaddition\" by \"+\"? The author's framework suggests an answer: the fact that my $\\eta$ satisfies the naturality condition for the categorical structure of arithmetic. If my $\\eta$ is natural (commutes with all morphisms), then my understanding is structurally determined --- there is no room for quaddition-like deviance, because the naturality condition constrains $\\eta$ globally, not just at finitely many points. This is not Kripke's \"skeptical solution\" (meaning as community agreement) but something closer to a **structural solution**: meaning is fixed by the naturality constraint itself.\n\nHowever, a Wittgensteinian would raise the following concern: **who verifies the naturality condition?** If Alice checks whether Bob's $\\eta$ commutes with all morphisms, she must access Bob's $\\eta$ --- which is, by hypothesis, an experience in Bob's $\\mathbb{E}$. The author's response would presumably be the philosophical experiment methodology: construct situations designed to test whether specific components of $\\eta$ are present, and check for replicable behavioral responses. This converts the naturality check into an empirical procedure, which is consistent with Wittgenstein's emphasis on practice. But it also shows that **intersubjective verification is always partial and practical** --- we can check finitely many components of $\\eta$ through experiments, but we can never verify the full naturality condition. This partial, practical character is, I think, exactly right, and it is exactly what Wittgenstein would predict: agreement is always agreement in what we *do*, not in some metaphysical fact about shared understanding.\n\n**Key conclusion**: The natural transformation $\\eta$ provides a **structural criterion for intersubjective commensurability** that is (1) consistent with the private language argument's conclusion that meaning is public, (2) more specific than Wittgenstein's appeal to \"agreement in form of life,\" and (3) potentially testable through the philosophical experiment methodology. This is a genuine contribution to philosophy of language.\n\n#### Translation Note (Addendum to Dictionary)\n\nThe term 主体间性 should be translated as **intersubjectivity**. In the author's framework, intersubjectivity is not grounded in empathy, shared consciousness, or transcendental structures, but in **structural commensurability** --- the sharing of naturality conditions. This is distinct from Husserl's intersubjectivity (grounded in empathic appresentation), Habermas's (grounded in communicative rationality), and Wittgenstein's (grounded in agreement in form of life). The author's is perhaps closest to Brandom's inferentialism, where intersubjectivity is constituted by the mutual recognition of inferential commitments.\n\n---\n\n### S2. The Essays as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThe author proposes that \"philosophical experiments\" consist in constructing examples with specific structures to awaken specific experiences in readers, then checking whether those experiences are replicable (K1策略, methodology point 3). The author further suggests in \"写在最后\" that this practice is already ubiquitous: poetry, literature, art, music, games, memes, and even decorating one's room are all instances of constructing 境 to awaken experience.\n\nRe-reading the essays with this lens reveals that **several passages are indeed functioning as philosophical experiments** --- they are not merely *describing* philosophical positions but are actively *constructing* experiential structures in the reader. Let me identify the most significant instances.\n\n#### Experiment 1: The Sisyphus/Cat Essay as Dissolution of Absurdity\n\nThe essay 西西弗斯、班与猫 has a very specific argumentative structure that functions as a philosophical experiment:\n\n1. **Setup (establishing the target experience)**: The reader is invited to feel the absurdity of Sisyphus's situation, and then the absurdity of the office worker's situation. These are familiar scenarios; most readers will have a pre-existing $\\eta$ that connects \"repetitive labor\" with \"absurdity.\"\n\n2. **Pivot (disrupting the structural alignment)**: The author introduces the entrepreneur --- structurally identical labor, but no absurdity. This forces the reader to notice that their $\\eta$ between \"repetition\" and \"absurdity\" was not intrinsic but contingent on **alienation** (the meaning being external).\n\n3. **Dissolution (constructing a new $\\eta$)**: The cat example. Here the author constructs a scenario that is structurally identical to Sisyphus (repetitive, effortful, no cosmic purpose) but where the experience of absurdity is simply **absent**. The rhetorical force of this example depends on the reader *actually experiencing* the absence of absurdity when thinking about cat care. The sentence \"没有一个养猫的人会感到荒谬，荒谬从未来过\" is designed to trigger the reader's introspective verification: *Is this true? Do I feel absurdity when I think about caring for a cat?* The expected answer is no, and this no is itself the philosophical experiment's result.\n\nFrom a Wittgensteinian perspective, this is a paradigmatic example of **philosophical therapy conducted through examples** --- exactly what Wittgenstein does in the *Investigations*. Consider PI section 66, where Wittgenstein asks the reader to \"look and see\" whether there is something common to all games. The rhetorical structure is identical: Wittgenstein constructs a series of examples, invites the reader to introspect, and expects a specific experiential result (the *absence* of a common feature). The cat example works the same way: the author constructs a scenario, invites introspection, and expects the *absence* of absurdity.\n\nWhat makes this a philosophical *experiment* rather than merely a philosophical *argument* is that **the reader's introspective response is the evidence**. If the reader *does* feel absurdity when thinking about cat care, the experiment has failed for that reader, and the philosophical claim is not established. The claim is empirical-experiential, not logically necessary.\n\nThis is genuinely Wittgensteinian in method, even if the author's framework provides a more structural account of *why* the method works (the examples construct specific categorical structures that do or do not support a natural transformation involving \"absurdity\").\n\n#### Experiment 2: The 道德仁义礼 Reversal as Restructuring of the Reader's 境\n\nThe 道德仁义礼 passage in 后形而上学 整理 functions as a different kind of philosophical experiment --- one aimed at **restructuring** the reader's 境 rather than dissolving a specific feeling.\n\nThe passage proceeds in several steps:\n\n1. **The traditional ordering is presented**: 道 -> 德 -> 仁 -> 义 -> 礼. This is the familiar top-down metaphysical picture. Most readers educated in Chinese philosophy will have an existing $\\eta$ aligning this ordering with their understanding of the concepts.\n\n2. **The author introduces \"现象礼\"**: The reader is asked to recall the actual *experience* of ritual behavior --- how it feels, from the inside, to behave ritually toward others. This is a request for introspection.\n\n3. **The reversal is performed step by step**: 现象礼 -> 现象义 -> 现象仁 -> 德 -> 道. Each step is justified by appeal to the reader's own experience: \"this feeling is what you actually experience\" (切实感受到的). The reader is being guided through a reconstruction of their own experiential categories.\n\n4. **The inversion is made explicit**: \"整个逻辑的顺序就被倒反过来.\" The reader is invited to experience the *shift* --- the moment when the traditional ordering \"flips\" and the reader sees that what they took to be foundational (道) was actually derived (from 现象礼).\n\nFrom a Wittgensteinian perspective, this is a **perspicuous presentation** (*ubersichtliche Darstellung*, PI section 122) --- a rearrangement of what was already known that produces a new way of seeing. Wittgenstein's own method in the *Investigations* is precisely this: he does not introduce new facts but rearranges familiar facts so that we see them differently. The duck-rabbit (PI p. 194) is the iconic example: the same figure, seen differently.\n\nBut the 道德仁义礼 passage is more than a static perspicuous presentation --- it is a **guided restructuring** of the reader's experiential categories. The reader's $\\mathcal{E}$ is being actively reorganized: the meta-order of 道, 德, 仁, 义, 礼 is being inverted. If the experiment succeeds, the reader emerges with a different categorical structure --- one where phenomena are foundational and metaphysical concepts are derived. This is a restructuring of the reader's 境 itself.\n\nThis is something Wittgenstein does implicitly but never theorizes. The author, by providing the category-theoretic framework, can now describe *what happens* when a philosophical example restructures one's understanding: it changes the meta-ordering of objects in $\\mathcal{E}$, potentially changing which objects serve as universal properties, and thereby changing the reader's metaphysical commitments.\n\n#### Experiment 3: The \"1+1=2\" Passage as Evoking $\\eta$\n\nIn K1策略, the passage where the author asks the reader to introspect on the experience of understanding \"1+1=2\" is itself a philosophical experiment. The reader is asked:\n\n- Do you experience a \"direct confirmation sense\" when you see \"1+1=2\"?\n- Is this different from the experience of checking your answer against a reference?\n- Can you recognize the experience of $\\eta$ as identity (掌握) versus $\\eta$ as non-trivial (理解 without 掌握)?\n\nThe passage about the meme sentence \"你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国，记住我给出的原理\" is particularly effective: the reader is asked to notice the *failure* of $\\eta$ --- the experience of **not understanding** despite grammatical correctness. This negative result (the absence of alignment) is just as experimentally significant as the positive case.\n\n#### Experiment 4: The 忒修斯之船 (Ship of Theseus) as Evoking the Universal Property\n\nIn 范畴论与境 整理, the Ship of Theseus discussion asks the reader to introspect: \"When you think of the Ship of Theseus, what do you experience?\" The expected answer is a specific *feeling* --- the feeling that accompanies the concept of this particular ship, which is the universal property of the sub-category $\\mathcal{E}_{\\text{Theseus}}$. The author then shows that choosing $\\mathfrak{P}$ as the physical world leads to the paradox (the universal property becomes \"emptiness\"), while choosing $\\mathfrak{P}$ as phenomena resolves it (the universal property is the *feeling* of \"this ship\"). The reader is invited to verify this through introspection: \"Is the identity of the Ship of Theseus located in the physical planks or in my experience of the ship?\"\n\n#### Wittgensteinian Assessment of the Experimental Method\n\nWittgenstein would have a complex reaction to the philosophical experiment methodology:\n\n**What he would endorse**: The centrality of concrete examples, the appeal to introspective verification, the refusal to argue from abstract principles alone. These are all Wittgensteinian virtues. PI section 593: \"A main cause of philosophical disease --- a one-sided diet: one nourishes one's thinking with only one kind of example.\"\n\n**What he would resist**: The idea that introspective responses can be treated as *data* for a structural theory. For Wittgenstein, the examples are **self-sufficient** --- they do not serve a higher theoretical purpose. They are not evidence for a theory about natural transformations; they are the thing itself. The moment you treat introspective responses as data points in a structural theory, you have, from Wittgenstein's perspective, taken a step away from the phenomena and toward a philosophical construction.\n\n**What is genuinely new**: The author's key innovation is the claim that philosophical experiments can be designed *in advance* by specifying the categorical structure that should evoke the target experience. This is the reverse of Wittgenstein's method: Wittgenstein finds examples that dissolve existing confusions; the author proposes to *construct* examples that produce *specific predicted* experiences. This is a move from therapeutic philosophy to what we might call **constructive experimental phenomenology**. It has no precedent in Wittgenstein, though it has affinities with Austin's method of constructing specific speech-act scenarios to test linguistic intuitions. (Austin also believed that carefully constructed examples could serve as evidence for philosophical claims about language.)\n\n**The deepest insight**: The author's observation that the essays *themselves* are philosophical experiments --- not just descriptions of a theory but active interventions in the reader's experiential structure --- collapses the distinction between philosophical writing and philosophical practice. This is actually the most Wittgensteinian thing in the entire collection, because it embodies Wittgenstein's claim that philosophy is an *activity* (Tractatus 4.112), not a body of doctrine. The essays do not merely *say* that meaning is experiential alignment; they *show* it by constructing experiences in the reader. The medium is the message. This is philosophy as performance, as practice --- which is, in the end, what Wittgenstein always insisted philosophy should be.\n","numLines":475,"startLine":1,"totalLines":475}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"71408b10-456e-43ce-9d21-b88b7e78bede"}

Forms of Life and 境/梦境","originalFile":"# Wittgenstein and Philosophy of Language: Expert Analysis of the 境集 Essays\n\n**Analyst**: Specialist in Wittgenstein (early and late), Speech Act Theory, Inferentialism, and Formal Semantics\n**Date**: February 2026\n\n---\n\n## 1. Language Games in the Framework\n\n### The Author's Usage of 语言游戏 (Language Games)\n\nIn K1策略, the author explicitly invokes the concept of 语言游戏 (language games) as a method for investigating stable structures ($S_L$) within the linguistic sub-category $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$. The key passage states:\n\n> \"于是我们就可以通过语言游戏研究语言演化中的稳定结构 $S_L$，来间接获得对 $\\mathbb{E}_t$ 中 $S_E$ 的认识\"\n\nThis usage represents a **productive but significantly reoriented extension** of Wittgenstein's concept. In the *Philosophical Investigations*, language games serve multiple functions: they are simplified models of language use (PI section 2), they illustrate the multiplicity and heterogeneity of linguistic practices (PI section 23), and they are bound up with \"forms of life\" (PI section 23). Crucially, for Wittgenstein, language games are **not instruments for discovering underlying structures**. They are the thing itself --- the level at which meaning operates. There is no deeper structure that language games reveal; rather, language games *are* the bedrock.\n\nThe author, by contrast, treats language games as **probes** --- methodological instruments that, through the functor $(F_{E,L})_t$, can map linguistic stable structures onto experiential stable structures. This is closer to what we might call a **constructive-structuralist** appropriation of language games. Wittgenstein would likely resist this move, since for him the idea that language games reveal hidden invariants would itself be a philosophical confusion --- the very kind of theorizing he sought to dissolve.\n\nHowever, the author's framework is more subtle than a naive structuralism. The author acknowledges that the mapping $(F_{E,L})_t(S_L) \\approx S_E$ is only approximate, that it captures at best a partial overlap, and that the relationship is descriptive rather than constitutive. This qualification brings the author somewhat closer to Wittgenstein's therapeutic spirit: the framework does not claim to have found the *essence* of meaning, but rather offers a tool for mapping certain structural relationships.\n\n### Therapeutic vs. Constructive Conceptions\n\nWittgenstein's conception of philosophy is famously therapeutic: \"The philosopher treats a question; like an illness\" (PI section 255). The aim is not to construct theories but to dissolve confusions by achieving a \"perspicuous presentation\" (*ubersichtliche Darstellung*, PI section 122). PI section 133 states: \"The real discovery is the one that enables me to break off doing philosophy when I want to.\"\n\nThe author explicitly mentions 哲学治疗 (philosophical therapy) in K1策略 and claims that the framework explains why it works --- roughly, through the resolution of \"tension\" (张力) when experiential sub-categories lack a well-defined universal property. This is a **structural explanation of why therapy works**, which is itself a constructive philosophical move. Wittgenstein would not attempt to explain *why* therapy works in structural-mathematical terms; for him, the therapy works by showing us the way out of the fly-bottle (PI section 309), not by constructing a formal account of fly-bottles.\n\n**Assessment**: The author's use of language games is a **departure** from Wittgenstein's anti-theoretical stance, but it is a **self-aware departure**. The author does not claim to be doing what Wittgenstein did; rather, the author uses Wittgenstein's concept as one input among many in a constructive framework. This is closer to how Robert Brandom appropriates Wittgenstein --- taking the insight about the primacy of practice and embedding it within a systematic philosophical project --- than to the quietist reading of Wittgenstein associated with Cora Diamond and James Conant.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Meaning and Structure: 是结构先于意义，还是意义先于结构？\n\n### The Author's Resolution via Natural Transformations\n\nIn K1策略, the author asks: does structure precede meaning, or meaning precede structure? The resolution is given through the natural transformation framework:\n\n> \"结构和意义之间的关系是自然变换：一句话能够被理解，他必须能够在心理过程的演化和结构的演化中达成如上所述的这种一致性感受$\\eta$\"\n\nThis is a striking move. The author refuses the dichotomy by arguing that structure and meaning are related by a **natural transformation** --- neither generates the other, but they must be **aligned**. Understanding ($\\eta$) is precisely the experience of this alignment.\n\n### Relation to Wittgenstein's Meaning-as-Use\n\nWittgenstein's meaning-as-use thesis (PI section 43: \"the meaning of a word is its use in the language\") dissolves the structure/meaning dichotomy from a different direction. For Wittgenstein, there is no pre-linguistic meaning that structure then encodes, nor is there a pure structure that then generates meaning. Meaning simply *is* the pattern of use within a language game embedded in a form of life.\n\nThe author's framework can be read as a **formalization of why Wittgenstein's dissolution works**. If structure and meaning are related by natural transformation rather than by generation, then asking which comes first is indeed a confused question --- just as Wittgenstein suggests. The natural transformation framework gives mathematical content to the Wittgensteinian insight that meaning and use are co-constitutive.\n\nHowever, there is a crucial difference. For Wittgenstein, meaning-as-use is meant to *stop* philosophical theorizing about meaning. The point is that once we see that meaning is use, there is nothing further to explain. The author, by contrast, uses the dissolution of the dichotomy as a *starting point* for further structural analysis. This is characteristic of the author's general approach: taking Wittgensteinian therapeutic insights and converting them into constructive theoretical resources.\n\n### Contrast with Formal Semantics\n\nIn truth-conditional formal semantics (Montague, Davidson, Tarski), meaning is identified with truth-conditions, and structure (syntactic/logical form) determines meaning via compositional rules. This is a clear \"structure precedes meaning\" position. The author's framework differs from this in several ways:\n\n1. **No appeal to truth**: The author's framework, consistent with the Knowledge essay, does not invoke truth-conditions. Meaning is experiential alignment ($\\eta$), not truth-value assignment.\n2. **Bidirectionality**: Formal semantics maps structure to meaning; the author's natural transformation allows influence in both directions.\n3. **Dynamic character**: Formal semantics is typically static (a sentence has its meaning at a time); the author's framework is inherently evolutionary ($t \\to t+1$).\n\nThe author's position has more in common with **dynamic semantics** (Kamp, Heim, Groenendijk & Stokhof) and with **inferentialist semantics** (Brandom), where meaning is constituted by inferential role and responsive to context, than with classical Montague grammar.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The Picture Theory and Natural Transformations\n\n### Tractatus Picture Theory\n\nThe early Wittgenstein's picture theory (Tractatus 2.1--2.225) posits that propositions are pictures of reality. A picture shares \"logical form\" with what it depicts (T 2.18). The picture \"reaches up to reality\" (T 2.1511) through a structural isomorphism between the elements of the picture and the elements of the state of affairs.\n\n### The Author's Natural Transformation Framework\n\nThe author's framework posits that understanding occurs when the evolution of a formal structure (e.g., mathematics, language) and the evolution of experience are related by a natural transformation. The $\\eta_a$ component measures the alignment between two paths from structure to experience.\n\n### Comparison\n\nThere is a **genuine structural parallel**. Both frameworks posit that the relationship between language/formalism and reality/experience is mediated by **structural correspondence**. However, the differences are substantial:\n\n| Feature | Tractatus Picture Theory | Author's Framework |\n|---|---|---|\n| Correspondence type | Isomorphism (static) | Natural transformation (dynamic) |\n| What corresponds | Proposition and state of affairs | Structural evolution and experiential evolution |\n| Nature of correspondence | Logical form shared | Alignment ($\\eta$) experienced |\n| Status of correspondence | Metaphysical necessity | Empirical/experiential claim |\n| Directionality | One-way (picture depicts) | Bidirectional (natural transformation) |\n\nThe author's framework can be read as a **category-theoretic generalization** of the picture theory in the following precise sense: where the Tractatus requires a *single* structural isomorphism between a proposition and a fact, the author requires a *family* of morphisms ($\\eta_a$) that are *natural* (coherent across all objects and morphisms). The naturality condition is the key upgrade --- it captures not just point-by-point correspondence but **systematic coherence** across the entire categorical structure.\n\nMoreover, the author's framework **inherits the later Wittgenstein's corrections** to the picture theory. The Tractatus picture theory fails because it cannot account for the diversity of language uses (commands, jokes, prayers, greetings --- none of which \"picture\" anything). The author's framework avoids this by making the relevant correspondence *experiential* rather than *representational*. Understanding a joke is having the right $\\eta$ between the joke's structural unfolding and one's experiential response --- no picturing required.\n\n**Assessment**: The author's framework is best understood not as a generalization of the picture theory *per se*, but as a framework that **subsumes both** the picture theory (as a special case where $\\eta$ is an isomorphism) and the later Wittgenstein's meaning-as-use (as the general case where $\\eta$ captures experiential alignment).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Philosophical Therapy (哲学治疗)\n\n### The Author's Account\n\nIn K1策略, the author provides a structural account of why philosophical therapy works, centered on the concept of 张力 (tension) --- the state where a sub-category lacks a well-defined universal property, so that experience cannot resolve into a stable terminal point:\n\n> \"这也是哲学治疗为什么有效的原因\"\n\nThe author connects this to the idea that philosophical puzzlement arises from structural tension --- multiple potential universal properties competing without resolution --- and that therapy works by restructuring the category so that the tension is resolved.\n\n### Wittgenstein's Therapeutic Conception\n\nFor Wittgenstein, philosophical problems arise from linguistic confusions: \"philosophical problems arise when language goes on holiday\" (PI section 38). Therapy consists in \"assembling reminders for a particular purpose\" (PI section 127) --- drawing attention to how words are actually used so that the confused philosopher can see that there was no genuine problem.\n\n### The Tension\n\nThe author's account **explains** why therapy works; Wittgenstein would regard such an explanation as itself a philosophical confusion. Wittgenstein explicitly rejects the idea that philosophy should produce theories (PI section 109: \"we may not advance any kind of theory\"). For Wittgenstein, the therapeutic effect is self-evident once the confusion is cleared; there is nothing further to explain.\n\nHowever, the author's account does something that Wittgenstein's does not: it provides a **positive criterion** for when philosophical puzzlement should arise and when it should be resolved. By identifying puzzlement with categorical tension, the author can (in principle) predict which conceptual configurations will produce confusion and which will not. This is a genuinely productive extension, even if it violates Wittgenstein's quietism.\n\nFurthermore, the author's framework offers an interesting **bridge** between Wittgenstein's therapeutic approach and more constructive philosophical programs. If therapy works by resolving categorical tension, then constructive philosophy (building new frameworks, new concepts) is *also* a form of therapy --- it resolves tension not by showing that the question was confused, but by providing new categorical structure in which the tension can be resolved. This is close to what the author describes as the construction of 境.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Rule-Following and 恒常 (Constancy)\n\n### The Author's Account of Stable Structures\n\nThe concept of 恒常 (constancy) is introduced in 后形而上学 整理 as the core of metaphysical thinking:\n\n> \"形而上的核心是恒常。我们需要在变化的现象之中寻找到（追求）一种恒常性\"\n\nIn K1策略, this is formalized as stable structures $S_E$ preserved under the evolution functor $T$. The idea is that certain structural features of experience are invariant under experiential evolution --- they are the \"rules\" that constrain how experience can develop.\n\n### Wittgenstein's Rule-Following\n\nWittgenstein's rule-following considerations (PI sections 138--242) constitute one of the most profound and difficult passages in 20th-century philosophy. The central problem is: what constitutes following a rule? Wittgenstein argues against any **mentalist** or **Platonist** account of rules. A rule is not a mental state that determines its applications, nor is it an abstract object that we grasp. Rather, rule-following is a *practice* --- it consists in the regularity of a community's behavior, and there is no deeper fact that makes the behavior count as following *this* rule rather than *that* one.\n\nThe Kripkenstein paradox (Kripke's reading of Wittgenstein) sharpens this: for any finite sequence of applications, there are infinitely many rules consistent with that sequence. What determines that we are following addition rather than \"quaddition\"?\n\n### Comparison\n\nThe author's formalization of constancy as functorial invariance is in tension with Wittgenstein's anti-formalism in several ways:\n\n1. **Formalization vs. practice**: The author treats rules as mathematical invariants ($S_E$ preserved under $T$); Wittgenstein insists that rules are constituted by practice, not by any formal structure.\n\n2. **Community vs. individual**: Wittgenstein's rule-following requires a community of practitioners; the author's framework is largely individualistic (analyzing the evolution of a single person's $\\mathbb{E}_t$).\n\n3. **Determinacy**: The author's $S_E$ is (in principle) mathematically determinate; Wittgenstein argues that there is no fact of the matter about which rule is being followed apart from practice.\n\nHowever, the author's framework also has **surprising resonances** with Wittgenstein:\n\n1. **No ground-level rules**: The author explicitly states that $S_E$ is descriptive, not constitutive. The stable structures are observed regularities, not prescriptive rules. This is actually close to Wittgenstein's point: the \"rule\" is what we observe in practice, not a Platonic entity.\n\n2. **Non-uniqueness**: The author acknowledges that different choices of sub-categories and different time-ranges will yield different $S_E$. This echoes Wittgenstein's point that rule-following is context-dependent and community-relative.\n\n3. **The role of agreement**: When the author discusses philosophical experiments and the possibility of evoking shared experiences across different people, the criterion of success is structural agreement --- \"只需要他们具有相同的结构性位置.\" This is remarkably close to Wittgenstein's emphasis on \"agreement in form of life\" (PI section 241) as the basis for following the same rule.\n\n**Assessment**: The author formalizes what Wittgenstein deliberately left un-formalized. Whether this is a productive move or a misunderstanding depends on one's reading of Wittgenstein. On a therapeutic reading, it is a confusion. On a constructive reading (closer to Brandom or McDowell), it is a legitimate extension that preserves the anti-Platonist and practice-oriented spirit while adding mathematical precision.\n\n---\n\n## 6. On Certainty and the Knowledge Essay\n\n### The Author's Argument\n\nIn \"A Thought on Knowledge,\" the author argues that knowledge reduces to belief by analyzing each component of the traditional justified true belief (JTB) definition:\n\n1. **Truth condition**: methodologically impossible --- we have access only to phenomena, never to truth directly.\n2. **Justification condition**: all justification ultimately rests on phenomena or beliefs; phenomena must be \"digested\" into beliefs to be used; therefore justification is ultimately belief about belief.\n3. **Conclusion**: knowledge is, in practice, \"what each individual believes to be correct.\"\n\n### Wittgenstein's On Certainty\n\n*On Certainty* (OC), written in the last months of Wittgenstein's life, addresses Moore's \"proof of the external world.\" Wittgenstein argues that certain propositions function not as items of knowledge but as **hinge propositions** --- they are the framework within which knowledge claims, doubts, and justifications operate. \"The questions that we raise and our doubts depend on the fact that some propositions are exempt from doubt, as it were like hinges on which those turn\" (OC section 341).\n\nKey features of hinge propositions:\n- They are not known in the traditional sense; they are the **conditions** for knowing (OC section 403).\n- They cannot be justified, but this does not make them arbitrary (OC section 559).\n- They belong to a \"system\" or \"world-picture\" (*Weltbild*) (OC section 162).\n- They can change over time as practices change (OC section 96).\n\n### Connection\n\nThe author's analysis and Wittgenstein's *On Certainty* arrive at strikingly similar conclusions through different routes:\n\n1. **Foundationalism fails**: The author shows that justification bottoms out in unjustified belief or circular justification. Wittgenstein shows that justification bottoms out in hinge propositions that are not themselves justified.\n\n2. **Practice over theory**: The author repeatedly emphasizes \"in practice\" (在实践中) --- what people actually do when they claim to know something. Wittgenstein similarly focuses on what Moore *actually does* when he says \"I know this is a hand.\"\n\n3. **Knowledge as communal standard**: The author proposes that knowledge is \"what most people in a field believe to be correct.\" Wittgenstein's world-picture is similarly communal and practice-embedded.\n\n4. **Historical contingency**: The author notes that knowledge \"changes over time (e.g., geocentrism).\" Wittgenstein explicitly allows that hinge propositions can shift (OC section 96--99).\n\nHowever, there is a significant difference. Wittgenstein would resist the reduction of knowledge to belief. For Wittgenstein, hinge propositions are **neither** known **nor** believed --- they are the framework within which the distinction between knowledge and belief operates. The author's move is more radical: dissolving the knowledge/belief distinction entirely. This is closer to **pragmatism** (James, Dewey, Rorty) than to Wittgenstein, who preserves the grammar of \"knowing\" and \"believing\" even as he transforms their philosophical significance.\n\nThe author's analysis of scientific knowledge through the lens of high-energy physics (where \"fundamental particles\" are never directly observed, only electromagnetic signals in detectors that are then reconstructed through models) is particularly compelling and parallels Wittgenstein's observation in OC section 105: \"All testing, all confirmation and disconfirmation of a hypothesis takes place already within a system.\"\n\n---\n\n## 7. Private Language and Intersubjectivity\n\n### The Author's Position\n\nAcross the essays, the author repeatedly argues that we cannot access others' inner states:\n\n> \"人类不仅永远无法真正知道其他人的真实想法\" (关于集体利益)\n\n> \"我无法真正感受到他人的内心感受\" (后形而上学 整理)\n\nYet the author proposes a criterion for communication and intersubjective verification:\n\n> \"我们不需要本体论的验证不同的人获得了'同一'体验（例如Qualia），只需要他们具有相同的结构性位置\" (K1策略)\n\n### Wittgenstein's Private Language Argument\n\nWittgenstein's private language argument (PI sections 243--315) argues that a language whose terms refer to the speaker's private sensations, knowable only to the speaker, is impossible. The key moves:\n\n1. A private linguist cannot establish a criterion of correctness for their sensation-terms (PI section 258).\n2. Without such a criterion, there is no distinction between following a rule and merely thinking one is following a rule (PI section 202).\n3. Therefore, the meaning of sensation-terms must be grounded in public, shared practices.\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe author's position is **deeply compatible** with the private language argument, perhaps more than the author realizes. Consider:\n\n1. **Structural position as public criterion**: The author's proposal that shared experience is verified by \"structural position\" rather than by qualitative identity is exactly the kind of **public criterion** that Wittgenstein argues sensation-terms must have. We don't need to verify that your red *feels* the same as my red; we need only verify that \"red\" occupies the same structural position in both our linguistic/experiential networks.\n\n2. **Rejection of private access**: The author's insistence that we cannot know others' inner states, combined with the claim that structural verification suffices for communication, mirrors Wittgenstein's point that the \"private object\" drops out as irrelevant to meaning (PI section 293, the \"beetle in the box\" passage).\n\n3. **Category-theoretic formalization**: The author's framework provides a precise mathematical formulation of what \"same structural position\" means: isomorphic placement within a categorical structure. This goes beyond what Wittgenstein offers but is entirely consistent with his philosophical conclusions.\n\nWhere the author diverges from Wittgenstein is in maintaining that there genuinely *are* inner states that we cannot access --- the framework preserves subjective experience as ontologically real even if epistemically inaccessible. Wittgenstein, by contrast, argues that the very picture of \"inner states\" that others cannot access is confused: \"The essential thing about private experience is really not that each person possesses his own exemplar, but that nobody knows whether other people also have this or something else\" (PI section 272). For Wittgenstein, this \"not knowing\" is not an epistemic limitation but a grammatical observation --- the concept of \"knowing another's sensation\" has no clear application.\n\n**Assessment**: The author's structural verification criterion is one of the most philosophically productive ideas in the collection, and it can be read as a **constructive implementation** of Wittgenstein's insight that meaning is public. The category-theoretic apparatus provides precisely the tools needed to make \"same structural position\" rigorous.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Forms of Life and 境/梦境\n\n### Wittgenstein's Forms of Life (Lebensformen)\n\n\"Forms of life\" is one of the most evocative and under-determined concepts in Wittgenstein. It appears only a handful of times in the *Investigations* (PI sections 19, 23, 241; PI p. 226). Its precise meaning is debated, but the central idea is that language games are embedded in broader patterns of human activity, behavior, and agreement. \"To imagine a language means to imagine a form of life\" (PI section 19).\n\nForms of life are:\n- **Not reducible to rules or structures**: they include the \"weave of life\" --- behaviors, reactions, training, natural history.\n- **The given**: \"What has to be accepted, the given, is --- so one could say --- forms of life\" (PI p. 226).\n- **Neither subjective nor objective**: they are the shared background against which subjectivity and objectivity make sense.\n\n### The Author's 境 and 梦境\n\nThe author's 境 ($\\mathbb{E}$) is defined as a categorical structure on phenomena ($\\mathfrak{P}$): experiences as objects, associations (联想) as morphisms, forming a tower structure. 梦境 is the \"environment\" in which meaning becomes possible --- the \"packaging\" of experience within which purposes and significance arise.\n\n### Comparison\n\nThere are genuine parallels:\n\n1. **Background for meaning**: Both forms of life and 境 serve as the background against which meaning, understanding, and purpose operate. Neither is itself an object of direct scrutiny --- both are the medium *in which* we think and act.\n\n2. **Given-ness**: The author's insistence that we cannot escape all 境 (\"抛弃所有的梦境即是不可能的\") parallels Wittgenstein's claim that forms of life are \"the given.\"\n\n3. **Multiplicity**: The author allows for multiple sub-categories ($\\mathcal{E}_L$, $\\mathcal{E}_M$, $\\mathcal{E}_K$) within $\\mathbb{E}$; Wittgenstein allows for multiple, overlapping forms of life.\n\nHowever, the differences are also significant:\n\n1. **Formalization**: 境 is explicitly formalized using category theory; Wittgenstein's forms of life are deliberately left informal. Wittgenstein would likely regard the formalization as a category mistake --- forms of life are not the kind of thing that *can* be formalized, because they include precisely those aspects of human activity that resist formalization.\n\n2. **Individualism vs. communalism**: 境 is fundamentally individual (each person has their own $\\mathbb{E}_t$); forms of life are fundamentally communal (they are shared patterns of activity). This is a deep philosophical difference. The author addresses intersubjectivity through structural correspondence, but the starting point is the individual subject.\n\n3. **Static vs. dynamic**: The author's 境 evolves ($T_t: \\mathbb{E}_t \\to \\mathbb{E}_{t+1}$); Wittgenstein's forms of life are relatively stable (they change historically but are not theorized as evolving).\n\n4. **Dreamscape metaphor**: 梦境 (dreamscape) --- particularly the distinction between 沉醉 (immersed/intoxicated) and 清醒 (lucid/awake) --- introduces an element of **self-awareness** that has no direct parallel in Wittgenstein. The idea of a \"lucid dream\" where one is fully invested yet fully aware of the constructed nature of the meaning-structure goes beyond Wittgenstein's framework. This is more reminiscent of Heidegger's distinction between authentic and inauthentic existence, or of the Buddhist concept of mindfulness within samsara.\n\n**Assessment**: 境 is best understood not as a formalization of Wittgenstein's forms of life, but as a **parallel concept** developed from different philosophical motivations. Forms of life are the communal background of meaning; 境 is the individual structural medium of experience. The two concepts address overlapping philosophical territory but from different starting points and with different emphases.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Translation Challenges\n\n### Key Terms with Wittgensteinian Resonance\n\nThe following terms require careful handling in translation due to their proximity to --- but divergence from --- established Wittgensteinian terminology:\n\n**语言游戏 (language games)**: The standard translation of Wittgenstein's *Sprachspiele* is \"language games.\" The author uses the same Chinese term but with a different emphasis: as a methodological tool for discovering stable structures rather than as the bedrock of meaning. Translators should use \"language games\" but add a note distinguishing the author's usage from Wittgenstein's. Consider: \"language games (in the methodological sense)\" on first occurrence, then simply \"language games\" thereafter.\n\n**哲学治疗 (philosophical therapy)**: This translates straightforwardly as \"philosophical therapy,\" which is the standard rendering of Wittgenstein's concept. But since the author gives it a structural explanation (resolution of categorical tension), a translator's note should clarify the difference.\n\n**结构 (structure)** and **意义 (meaning)**: These are the central terms in the structure/meaning question. \"Structure\" and \"meaning\" are straightforward, but the translator should be aware that the author's use of \"meaning\" is experiential/phenomenological rather than truth-conditional or referential.\n\n**理解 (understanding) vs. 掌握 (mastery/grasp)**: This distinction is philosophically crucial. The author defines 掌握 as the special case where $\\eta_a$ is the identity --- a \"direct confirmation sense\" without mediation. This corresponds to what Wittgenstein calls \"understanding\" in its most robust sense. I recommend translating 理解 as \"understanding\" and 掌握 as \"mastery\" or \"direct grasp,\" with a note explaining that the latter is a technical term in the author's framework corresponding to the identity natural transformation.\n\n**恒常 (constancy)**: This is the author's term for the invariance at the heart of metaphysics. \"Constancy\" is adequate but risks confusion with Husserl's \"constancy\" (*Bestandigkeit*). \"Invariance\" captures the mathematical sense better, but \"constancy\" preserves the more phenomenological register. I recommend \"constancy\" with a parenthetical \"(invariance)\" on first occurrence.\n\n**境**: See the full dictionary entry below. This is the most challenging term.\n\n**规则 (rules)**: Standard translation. But note that the author's \"rules\" are stable structures ($S_E$), not Wittgensteinian rule-following practices.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Overall Significance\n\n### Does the Framework Achieve Something Wittgenstein Attempted?\n\nThe relationship between this framework and Wittgenstein's philosophy is best characterized as **complementary rather than duplicative**. Wittgenstein sought to dissolve philosophical problems by showing that they arise from linguistic confusions. The author seeks to **describe the structure of experience** in a way that makes philosophical problems tractable --- either dissolvable (by showing that they arise from categorical tension) or answerable (by mapping experiential structures through formal tools).\n\nThe deepest convergence is in the **anti-foundationalist** character of both projects:\n- Wittgenstein: there is no foundation beneath language games and forms of life; they are the given.\n- The author: there is no 第〇实在 (zeroth reality) accessible to us; phenomena are the 第一实在 (first reality), and all metaphysics is constructed *upon* phenomena.\n\nThe deepest divergence is in their attitudes toward **formalization**:\n- Wittgenstein: formalization is part of the disease, not the cure. Philosophical problems arise precisely from our attempt to force the richness of language use into formal molds.\n- The author: formalization (specifically, category theory) is a useful tool that, properly wielded, can illuminate the structure of experience without claiming to capture its essence.\n\n### Is the Category-Theoretic Formalization Productive?\n\nI believe it is, for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Natural transformations capture something real about understanding**. The idea that understanding is the alignment between structural evolution and experiential evolution, formalized as a natural transformation, is a genuinely illuminating philosophical proposal. It gives mathematical content to the vague notion of \"grasping\" meaning, and it does so in a way that is consistent with Wittgensteinian insights about the primacy of use and practice.\n\n2. **The structural verification criterion resolves a genuine problem**. Wittgenstein's private language argument establishes that meaning must be public, but it does not provide a positive account of *how* public meaning works. The author's structural position criterion fills this gap.\n\n3. **The framework is self-limiting**. The author repeatedly insists on the descriptive (rather than constitutive) character of the framework, and on the tool-like status of category theory. This self-limitation prevents the framework from falling into the kind of metaphysical dogmatism that Wittgenstein criticizes.\n\n4. **Connection to empirical verification**. The proposal for \"philosophical experiments\" --- constructing experiences with specific structural properties and verifying that they evoke the predicted experiential responses --- is a genuinely novel contribution to philosophical methodology. This goes beyond what Wittgenstein, the formal semanticists, or the speech act theorists have proposed.\n\nHowever, a Wittgensteinian critic would rightly note:\n- The framework may create new philosophical confusions even as it resolves old ones (e.g., reifying \"stable structures\" in experience).\n- The mathematical apparatus may obscure rather than illuminate for readers not trained in category theory.\n- The individualist starting point may miss the essentially communal character of meaning that Wittgenstein emphasizes.\n\n### Positioning in the Field\n\nWithin contemporary philosophy of language, this framework occupies a distinctive position:\n- It shares **inferentialism's** (Brandom) emphasis on structural relations over reference, but replaces inferential roles with categorical structures.\n- It shares **dynamic semantics'** emphasis on meaning as process, but operates at a more fundamental level (experience rather than discourse).\n- It shares **phenomenology's** (Husserl, Heidegger) emphasis on lived experience, but provides mathematical tools for structural analysis.\n- It inherits **Wittgenstein's** anti-foundationalism and emphasis on practice, but converts therapeutic insights into constructive resources.\n\nThe result is something genuinely new: a **structural phenomenology of meaning** that uses category theory as its formal backbone. Whether this will prove philosophically fruitful in the long run depends on whether the framework can generate specific, testable insights about the structure of understanding --- and the author's proposal for philosophical experiments suggests a path toward doing exactly that.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix: Notes on Individual Essays\n\n### 关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一\nFrom a philosophy of language perspective, the most interesting move here is the analogy between macro-level concepts (collective interest) and the renormalization group in physics. This parallels Wittgenstein's observation that concepts can operate at different \"levels\" without reducing to their micro-level constituents (cf. PI section 71 on family resemblance). The author's claim that \"人类不仅永远无法真正知道其他人的真实想法\" anticipates the private language considerations developed more fully in later essays.\n\n### A Thought on Knowledge\nThis essay is the most directly relevant to analytic epistemology and to *On Certainty*. The systematic stripping away of JTB components is clear and effective. The approach of focusing on \"how we access\" justification bases rather than \"what they are\" is thoroughly Wittgensteinian in spirit.\n\n### 西西弗斯、班与猫\nThe dissolution of absurdism through the concept of internally generated meaning (养猫) is philosophically elegant. From a Wittgensteinian perspective, the key insight is that meaning does not require articulation or justification --- the cat-owner does not need to state *why* cat care is meaningful. This resonates with Wittgenstein's observation that forms of life do not require external justification; they are the given.\n\n### 后形而上学 整理\nThe layered analysis of metaphysics (Types 0-3) and the \"inversion\" of 道德仁义礼 is sophisticated. The concept of 恒常 as the core of metaphysical thinking is a genuine contribution. The distinction between 第一实在 (phenomena) and 第二实在 (constructed reality) maps partially onto Wittgenstein's distinction between what is given and what is constructed in language, though the author's framework is more explicitly ontological.\n\n### 形而上学后的目的：诗意\nThe distinction between 沉醉 (immersed) and 清醒 (lucid) dreamscapes is philosophically original. It offers a way of being meaning-engaged that is neither naive (pre-critical) nor nihilistic (post-critical). This has no direct Wittgensteinian parallel but is consistent with the later Wittgenstein's acceptance of forms of life as \"the given.\"\n\n### 范畴论与境 整理\nThis is where the formal apparatus is developed. The identification of associations (联想) with morphisms, and the tower structure of experience, are the framework's most technically innovative features. The examples (Ship of Theseus, \"what is a person?\", dragon's blood) effectively illustrate how the formal tools apply to traditional philosophical problems.\n\n### 范畴论与境：K1策略\nThis is the framework's culminating essay. The natural transformation analysis of understanding, the structural verification criterion, and the proposal for philosophical experiments are the most philosophically significant contributions. The explicit engagement with language games and philosophical therapy shows the author's awareness of the Wittgensteinian tradition.\n\n### 关于诗意和境的一些零散想法\nThis collection of notes extends and applies the framework. The self-referential observation that we are already constructing 境 in everyday life --- choosing clothes, decorating rooms, taking photographs --- grounds the abstract framework in lived practice, which is the most Wittgensteinian gesture in the entire collection.\n\n---\n\n## Supplementary Analysis: Two Follow-Up Topics\n\n### S1. Intersubjectivity via the Natural Transformation $\\eta$\n\nThe author suggests that the natural transformation $\\eta$ is the mechanism through which intersubjective verification is possible. Let me trace how this works and assess it from a Wittgensteinian perspective.\n\n#### The Mechanism\n\nConsider two people, Alice and Bob, both reading the sentence \"The cat jumped on the table\" (猫跳上了桌子). In K1策略, understanding this sentence requires a natural transformation between the sentence's structural evolution (its syntactic unfolding) and one's experiential evolution (the mental simulation of the event). If Alice has an $\\eta^A$ and Bob has an $\\eta^B$, the question of intersubjectivity becomes: do Alice and Bob understand the same thing?\n\nThe author's answer (K1策略 methodology point 3) is that we do not need ontological verification that $\\eta^A$ and $\\eta^B$ are qualitatively identical --- we need only that they occupy the same **structural position**. That is, if Alice's $\\eta^A$ relates the same objects and morphisms in the same way as Bob's $\\eta^B$, then their understanding is commensurable.\n\nMore precisely: the naturality condition requires that $\\eta$ commutes with all morphisms in the source category. This means $\\eta$ is not a free-floating subjective response but a **structurally constrained** response. Two people whose $\\eta$'s satisfy the same naturality diagrams are, in a rigorous mathematical sense, aligned --- even if the \"felt quality\" of their $\\eta$'s differs. The commutative diagram itself is the public, shareable criterion of understanding.\n\n#### Wittgensteinian Assessment\n\nThis is, I believe, the most philosophically significant move in the entire collection, and it represents a **genuine advance** on the intersubjectivity problem that goes beyond what Wittgenstein himself achieved. Here is why.\n\nWittgenstein's treatment of intersubjectivity operates on two levels:\n\n1. **The Private Language Argument (PI sections 243--315)**: Meaning must be public. The \"beetle in the box\" thought experiment (PI section 293) shows that if everyone has a box with something in it that only they can see, the \"something\" drops out of the language game --- what matters is the *role* of \"beetle\" in our shared practice, not its private content.\n\n2. **Agreement in Form of Life (PI section 241)**: \"So you are saying that human agreement decides what is true and what is false?\" --- \"It is what human beings *say* that is true and false; and they agree in the *language* they use. That is not agreement in opinions but in form of life.\"\n\nWittgenstein establishes that meaning is public and that intersubjective agreement is grounded in shared form of life. But he does not provide a **mechanism** for how this works. He would resist providing one, on therapeutic grounds --- the question \"how does intersubjective understanding work?\" is, for the quietist, already a confused question (understanding is not a process; cf. PI section 154).\n\nThe author's natural transformation framework provides what Wittgenstein deliberately withholds: a **positive structural account** of intersubjective alignment. The key insight is that **the naturality condition is itself the public criterion**. Consider:\n\n- The naturality square for $\\eta$ is a mathematical structure that can be checked, tested, and communicated.\n- Two people who both satisfy the naturality condition for the same source category are provably aligned in their structural responses.\n- This alignment does not require access to anyone's private experience --- it requires only that both people's responses are coherent with the same categorical structure.\n\nThis is precisely analogous to Wittgenstein's beetle-in-the-box: the private content ($\\eta^A$ vs $\\eta^B$ as felt experiences) drops out; what remains is the structural role ($\\eta$ as a natural transformation satisfying commutative diagrams). The author has given **mathematical content** to the beetle-in-the-box insight.\n\nFurthermore, the naturality condition addresses the **Kripkenstein problem** (Kripke's skeptical reading of Wittgenstein on rule-following). Kripke asks: what fact about me determines that I mean addition rather than \"quaddition\" by \"+\"? The author's framework suggests an answer: the fact that my $\\eta$ satisfies the naturality condition for the categorical structure of arithmetic. If my $\\eta$ is natural (commutes with all morphisms), then my understanding is structurally determined --- there is no room for quaddition-like deviance, because the naturality condition constrains $\\eta$ globally, not just at finitely many points. This is not Kripke's \"skeptical solution\" (meaning as community agreement) but something closer to a **structural solution**: meaning is fixed by the naturality constraint itself.\n\nHowever, a Wittgensteinian would raise the following concern: **who verifies the naturality condition?** If Alice checks whether Bob's $\\eta$ commutes with all morphisms, she must access Bob's $\\eta$ --- which is, by hypothesis, an experience in Bob's $\\mathbb{E}$. The author's response would presumably be the philosophical experiment methodology: construct situations designed to test whether specific components of $\\eta$ are present, and check for replicable behavioral responses. This converts the naturality check into an empirical procedure, which is consistent with Wittgenstein's emphasis on practice. But it also shows that **intersubjective verification is always partial and practical** --- we can check finitely many components of $\\eta$ through experiments, but we can never verify the full naturality condition. This partial, practical character is, I think, exactly right, and it is exactly what Wittgenstein would predict: agreement is always agreement in what we *do*, not in some metaphysical fact about shared understanding.\n\n**Key conclusion**: The natural transformation $\\eta$ provides a **structural criterion for intersubjective commensurability** that is (1) consistent with the private language argument's conclusion that meaning is public, (2) more specific than Wittgenstein's appeal to \"agreement in form of life,\" and (3) potentially testable through the philosophical experiment methodology. This is a genuine contribution to philosophy of language.\n\n#### Translation Note (Addendum to Dictionary)\n\nThe term 主体间性 should be translated as **intersubjectivity**. In the author's framework, intersubjectivity is not grounded in empathy, shared consciousness, or transcendental structures, but in **structural commensurability** --- the sharing of naturality conditions. This is distinct from Husserl's intersubjectivity (grounded in empathic appresentation), Habermas's (grounded in communicative rationality), and Wittgenstein's (grounded in agreement in form of life). The author's is perhaps closest to Brandom's inferentialism, where intersubjectivity is constituted by the mutual recognition of inferential commitments.\n\n---\n\n### S2. The Essays as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThe author proposes that \"philosophical experiments\" consist in constructing examples with specific structures to awaken specific experiences in readers, then checking whether those experiences are replicable (K1策略, methodology point 3). The author further suggests in \"写在最后\" that this practice is already ubiquitous: poetry, literature, art, music, games, memes, and even decorating one's room are all instances of constructing 境 to awaken experience.\n\nRe-reading the essays with this lens reveals that **several passages are indeed functioning as philosophical experiments** --- they are not merely *describing* philosophical positions but are actively *constructing* experiential structures in the reader. Let me identify the most significant instances.\n\n#### Experiment 1: The Sisyphus/Cat Essay as Dissolution of Absurdity\n\nThe essay 西西弗斯、班与猫 has a very specific argumentative structure that functions as a philosophical experiment:\n\n1. **Setup (establishing the target experience)**: The reader is invited to feel the absurdity of Sisyphus's situation, and then the absurdity of the office worker's situation. These are familiar scenarios; most readers will have a pre-existing $\\eta$ that connects \"repetitive labor\" with \"absurdity.\"\n\n2. **Pivot (disrupting the structural alignment)**: The author introduces the entrepreneur --- structurally identical labor, but no absurdity. This forces the reader to notice that their $\\eta$ between \"repetition\" and \"absurdity\" was not intrinsic but contingent on **alienation** (the meaning being external).\n\n3. **Dissolution (constructing a new $\\eta$)**: The cat example. Here the author constructs a scenario that is structurally identical to Sisyphus (repetitive, effortful, no cosmic purpose) but where the experience of absurdity is simply **absent**. The rhetorical force of this example depends on the reader *actually experiencing* the absence of absurdity when thinking about cat care. The sentence \"没有一个养猫的人会感到荒谬，荒谬从未来过\" is designed to trigger the reader's introspective verification: *Is this true? Do I feel absurdity when I think about caring for a cat?* The expected answer is no, and this no is itself the philosophical experiment's result.\n\nFrom a Wittgensteinian perspective, this is a paradigmatic example of **philosophical therapy conducted through examples** --- exactly what Wittgenstein does in the *Investigations*. Consider PI section 66, where Wittgenstein asks the reader to \"look and see\" whether there is something common to all games. The rhetorical structure is identical: Wittgenstein constructs a series of examples, invites the reader to introspect, and expects a specific experiential result (the *absence* of a common feature). The cat example works the same way: the author constructs a scenario, invites introspection, and expects the *absence* of absurdity.\n\nWhat makes this a philosophical *experiment* rather than merely a philosophical *argument* is that **the reader's introspective response is the evidence**. If the reader *does* feel absurdity when thinking about cat care, the experiment has failed for that reader, and the philosophical claim is not established. The claim is empirical-experiential, not logically necessary.\n\nThis is genuinely Wittgensteinian in method, even if the author's framework provides a more structural account of *why* the method works (the examples construct specific categorical structures that do or do not support a natural transformation involving \"absurdity\").\n\n#### Experiment 2: The 道德仁义礼 Reversal as Restructuring of the Reader's 境\n\nThe 道德仁义礼 passage in 后形而上学 整理 functions as a different kind of philosophical experiment --- one aimed at **restructuring** the reader's 境 rather than dissolving a specific feeling.\n\nThe passage proceeds in several steps:\n\n1. **The traditional ordering is presented**: 道 -> 德 -> 仁 -> 义 -> 礼. This is the familiar top-down metaphysical picture. Most readers educated in Chinese philosophy will have an existing $\\eta$ aligning this ordering with their understanding of the concepts.\n\n2. **The author introduces \"现象礼\"**: The reader is asked to recall the actual *experience* of ritual behavior --- how it feels, from the inside, to behave ritually toward others. This is a request for introspection.\n\n3. **The reversal is performed step by step**: 现象礼 -> 现象义 -> 现象仁 -> 德 -> 道. Each step is justified by appeal to the reader's own experience: \"this feeling is what you actually experience\" (切实感受到的). The reader is being guided through a reconstruction of their own experiential categories.\n\n4. **The inversion is made explicit**: \"整个逻辑的顺序就被倒反过来.\" The reader is invited to experience the *shift* --- the moment when the traditional ordering \"flips\" and the reader sees that what they took to be foundational (道) was actually derived (from 现象礼).\n\nFrom a Wittgensteinian perspective, this is a **perspicuous presentation** (*ubersichtliche Darstellung*, PI section 122) --- a rearrangement of what was already known that produces a new way of seeing. Wittgenstein's own method in the *Investigations* is precisely this: he does not introduce new facts but rearranges familiar facts so that we see them differently. The duck-rabbit (PI p. 194) is the iconic example: the same figure, seen differently.\n\nBut the 道德仁义礼 passage is more than a static perspicuous presentation --- it is a **guided restructuring** of the reader's experiential categories. The reader's $\\mathcal{E}$ is being actively reorganized: the meta-order of 道, 德, 仁, 义, 礼 is being inverted. If the experiment succeeds, the reader emerges with a different categorical structure --- one where phenomena are foundational and metaphysical concepts are derived. This is a restructuring of the reader's 境 itself.\n\nThis is something Wittgenstein does implicitly but never theorizes. The author, by providing the category-theoretic framework, can now describe *what happens* when a philosophical example restructures one's understanding: it changes the meta-ordering of objects in $\\mathcal{E}$, potentially changing which objects serve as universal properties, and thereby changing the reader's metaphysical commitments.\n\n#### Experiment 3: The \"1+1=2\" Passage as Evoking $\\eta$\n\nIn K1策略, the passage where the author asks the reader to introspect on the experience of understanding \"1+1=2\" is itself a philosophical experiment. The reader is asked:\n\n- Do you experience a \"direct confirmation sense\" when you see \"1+1=2\"?\n- Is this different from the experience of checking your answer against a reference?\n- Can you recognize the experience of $\\eta$ as identity (掌握) versus $\\eta$ as non-trivial (理解 without 掌握)?\n\nThe passage about the meme sentence \"你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国，记住我给出的原理\" is particularly effective: the reader is asked to notice the *failure* of $\\eta$ --- the experience of **not understanding** despite grammatical correctness. This negative result (the absence of alignment) is just as experimentally significant as the positive case.\n\n#### Experiment 4: The 忒修斯之船 (Ship of Theseus) as Evoking the Universal Property\n\nIn 范畴论与境 整理, the Ship of Theseus discussion asks the reader to introspect: \"When you think of the Ship of Theseus, what do you experience?\" The expected answer is a specific *feeling* --- the feeling that accompanies the concept of this particular ship, which is the universal property of the sub-category $\\mathcal{E}_{\\text{Theseus}}$. The author then shows that choosing $\\mathfrak{P}$ as the physical world leads to the paradox (the universal property becomes \"emptiness\"), while choosing $\\mathfrak{P}$ as phenomena resolves it (the universal property is the *feeling* of \"this ship\"). The reader is invited to verify this through introspection: \"Is the identity of the Ship of Theseus located in the physical planks or in my experience of the ship?\"\n\n#### Wittgensteinian Assessment of the Experimental Method\n\nWittgenstein would have a complex reaction to the philosophical experiment methodology:\n\n**What he would endorse**: The centrality of concrete examples, the appeal to introspective verification, the refusal to argue from abstract principles alone. These are all Wittgensteinian virtues. PI section 593: \"A main cause of philosophical disease --- a one-sided diet: one nourishes one's thinking with only one kind of example.\"\n\n**What he would resist**: The idea that introspective responses can be treated as *data* for a structural theory. For Wittgenstein, the examples are **self-sufficient** --- they do not serve a higher theoretical purpose. They are not evidence for a theory about natural transformations; they are the thing itself. The moment you treat introspective responses as data points in a structural theory, you have, from Wittgenstein's perspective, taken a step away from the phenomena and toward a philosophical construction.\n\n**What is genuinely new**: The author's key innovation is the claim that philosophical experiments can be designed *in advance* by specifying the categorical structure that should evoke the target experience. This is the reverse of Wittgenstein's method: Wittgenstein finds examples that dissolve existing confusions; the author proposes to *construct* examples that produce *specific predicted* experiences. This is a move from therapeutic philosophy to what we might call **constructive experimental phenomenology**. It has no precedent in Wittgenstein, though it has affinities with Austin's method of constructing specific speech-act scenarios to test linguistic intuitions. (Austin also believed that carefully constructed examples could serve as evidence for philosophical claims about language.)\n\n**The deepest insight**: The author's observation that the essays *themselves* are philosophical experiments --- not just descriptions of a theory but active interventions in the reader's experiential structure --- collapses the distinction between philosophical writing and philosophical practice. This is actually the most Wittgensteinian thing in the entire collection, because it embodies Wittgenstein's claim that philosophy is an *activity* (Tractatus 4.112), not a body of doctrine. The essays do not merely *say* that meaning is experiential alignment; they *show* it by constructing experiences in the reader. The medium is the message. This is philosophy as performance, as practice --- which is, in the end, what Wittgenstein always insisted philosophy should be.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":223,"oldLines":7,"newStart":223,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," Where the author diverges from Wittgenstein is in maintaining that there genuinely *are* inner states that we cannot access --- the framework preserves subjective experience as ontologically real even if epistemically inaccessible.

Overall Significance","originalFile":"# Wittgenstein and Philosophy of Language: Expert Analysis of the 境集 Essays\n\n**Analyst**: Specialist in Wittgenstein (early and late), Speech Act Theory, Inferentialism, and Formal Semantics\n**Date**: February 2026\n\n---\n\n## 1. Language Games in the Framework\n\n### The Author's Usage of 语言游戏 (Language Games)\n\nIn K1策略, the author explicitly invokes the concept of 语言游戏 (language games) as a method for investigating stable structures ($S_L$) within the linguistic sub-category $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$. The key passage states:\n\n> \"于是我们就可以通过语言游戏研究语言演化中的稳定结构 $S_L$，来间接获得对 $\\mathbb{E}_t$ 中 $S_E$ 的认识\"\n\nThis usage represents a **productive but significantly reoriented extension** of Wittgenstein's concept. In the *Philosophical Investigations*, language games serve multiple functions: they are simplified models of language use (PI section 2), they illustrate the multiplicity and heterogeneity of linguistic practices (PI section 23), and they are bound up with \"forms of life\" (PI section 23). Crucially, for Wittgenstein, language games are **not instruments for discovering underlying structures**. They are the thing itself --- the level at which meaning operates. There is no deeper structure that language games reveal; rather, language games *are* the bedrock.\n\nThe author, by contrast, treats language games as **probes** --- methodological instruments that, through the functor $(F_{E,L})_t$, can map linguistic stable structures onto experiential stable structures. This is closer to what we might call a **constructive-structuralist** appropriation of language games. Wittgenstein would likely resist this move, since for him the idea that language games reveal hidden invariants would itself be a philosophical confusion --- the very kind of theorizing he sought to dissolve.\n\nHowever, the author's framework is more subtle than a naive structuralism. The author acknowledges that the mapping $(F_{E,L})_t(S_L) \\approx S_E$ is only approximate, that it captures at best a partial overlap, and that the relationship is descriptive rather than constitutive. This qualification brings the author somewhat closer to Wittgenstein's therapeutic spirit: the framework does not claim to have found the *essence* of meaning, but rather offers a tool for mapping certain structural relationships.\n\n### Therapeutic vs. Constructive Conceptions\n\nWittgenstein's conception of philosophy is famously therapeutic: \"The philosopher treats a question; like an illness\" (PI section 255). The aim is not to construct theories but to dissolve confusions by achieving a \"perspicuous presentation\" (*ubersichtliche Darstellung*, PI section 122). PI section 133 states: \"The real discovery is the one that enables me to break off doing philosophy when I want to.\"\n\nThe author explicitly mentions 哲学治疗 (philosophical therapy) in K1策略 and claims that the framework explains why it works --- roughly, through the resolution of \"tension\" (张力) when experiential sub-categories lack a well-defined universal property. This is a **structural explanation of why therapy works**, which is itself a constructive philosophical move. Wittgenstein would not attempt to explain *why* therapy works in structural-mathematical terms; for him, the therapy works by showing us the way out of the fly-bottle (PI section 309), not by constructing a formal account of fly-bottles.\n\n**Assessment**: The author's use of language games is a **departure** from Wittgenstein's anti-theoretical stance, but it is a **self-aware departure**. The author does not claim to be doing what Wittgenstein did; rather, the author uses Wittgenstein's concept as one input among many in a constructive framework. This is closer to how Robert Brandom appropriates Wittgenstein --- taking the insight about the primacy of practice and embedding it within a systematic philosophical project --- than to the quietist reading of Wittgenstein associated with Cora Diamond and James Conant.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Meaning and Structure: 是结构先于意义，还是意义先于结构？\n\n### The Author's Resolution via Natural Transformations\n\nIn K1策略, the author asks: does structure precede meaning, or meaning precede structure? The resolution is given through the natural transformation framework:\n\n> \"结构和意义之间的关系是自然变换：一句话能够被理解，他必须能够在心理过程的演化和结构的演化中达成如上所述的这种一致性感受$\\eta$\"\n\nThis is a striking move. The author refuses the dichotomy by arguing that structure and meaning are related by a **natural transformation** --- neither generates the other, but they must be **aligned**. Understanding ($\\eta$) is precisely the experience of this alignment.\n\n### Relation to Wittgenstein's Meaning-as-Use\n\nWittgenstein's meaning-as-use thesis (PI section 43: \"the meaning of a word is its use in the language\") dissolves the structure/meaning dichotomy from a different direction. For Wittgenstein, there is no pre-linguistic meaning that structure then encodes, nor is there a pure structure that then generates meaning. Meaning simply *is* the pattern of use within a language game embedded in a form of life.\n\nThe author's framework can be read as a **formalization of why Wittgenstein's dissolution works**. If structure and meaning are related by natural transformation rather than by generation, then asking which comes first is indeed a confused question --- just as Wittgenstein suggests. The natural transformation framework gives mathematical content to the Wittgensteinian insight that meaning and use are co-constitutive.\n\nHowever, there is a crucial difference. For Wittgenstein, meaning-as-use is meant to *stop* philosophical theorizing about meaning. The point is that once we see that meaning is use, there is nothing further to explain. The author, by contrast, uses the dissolution of the dichotomy as a *starting point* for further structural analysis. This is characteristic of the author's general approach: taking Wittgensteinian therapeutic insights and converting them into constructive theoretical resources.\n\n### Contrast with Formal Semantics\n\nIn truth-conditional formal semantics (Montague, Davidson, Tarski), meaning is identified with truth-conditions, and structure (syntactic/logical form) determines meaning via compositional rules. This is a clear \"structure precedes meaning\" position. The author's framework differs from this in several ways:\n\n1. **No appeal to truth**: The author's framework, consistent with the Knowledge essay, does not invoke truth-conditions. Meaning is experiential alignment ($\\eta$), not truth-value assignment.\n2. **Bidirectionality**: Formal semantics maps structure to meaning; the author's natural transformation allows influence in both directions.\n3. **Dynamic character**: Formal semantics is typically static (a sentence has its meaning at a time); the author's framework is inherently evolutionary ($t \\to t+1$).\n\nThe author's position has more in common with **dynamic semantics** (Kamp, Heim, Groenendijk & Stokhof) and with **inferentialist semantics** (Brandom), where meaning is constituted by inferential role and responsive to context, than with classical Montague grammar.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The Picture Theory and Natural Transformations\n\n### Tractatus Picture Theory\n\nThe early Wittgenstein's picture theory (Tractatus 2.1--2.225) posits that propositions are pictures of reality. A picture shares \"logical form\" with what it depicts (T 2.18). The picture \"reaches up to reality\" (T 2.1511) through a structural isomorphism between the elements of the picture and the elements of the state of affairs.\n\n### The Author's Natural Transformation Framework\n\nThe author's framework posits that understanding occurs when the evolution of a formal structure (e.g., mathematics, language) and the evolution of experience are related by a natural transformation. The $\\eta_a$ component measures the alignment between two paths from structure to experience.\n\n### Comparison\n\nThere is a **genuine structural parallel**. Both frameworks posit that the relationship between language/formalism and reality/experience is mediated by **structural correspondence**. However, the differences are substantial:\n\n| Feature | Tractatus Picture Theory | Author's Framework |\n|---|---|---|\n| Correspondence type | Isomorphism (static) | Natural transformation (dynamic) |\n| What corresponds | Proposition and state of affairs | Structural evolution and experiential evolution |\n| Nature of correspondence | Logical form shared | Alignment ($\\eta$) experienced |\n| Status of correspondence | Metaphysical necessity | Empirical/experiential claim |\n| Directionality | One-way (picture depicts) | Bidirectional (natural transformation) |\n\nThe author's framework can be read as a **category-theoretic generalization** of the picture theory in the following precise sense: where the Tractatus requires a *single* structural isomorphism between a proposition and a fact, the author requires a *family* of morphisms ($\\eta_a$) that are *natural* (coherent across all objects and morphisms). The naturality condition is the key upgrade --- it captures not just point-by-point correspondence but **systematic coherence** across the entire categorical structure.\n\nMoreover, the author's framework **inherits the later Wittgenstein's corrections** to the picture theory. The Tractatus picture theory fails because it cannot account for the diversity of language uses (commands, jokes, prayers, greetings --- none of which \"picture\" anything). The author's framework avoids this by making the relevant correspondence *experiential* rather than *representational*. Understanding a joke is having the right $\\eta$ between the joke's structural unfolding and one's experiential response --- no picturing required.\n\n**Assessment**: The author's framework is best understood not as a generalization of the picture theory *per se*, but as a framework that **subsumes both** the picture theory (as a special case where $\\eta$ is an isomorphism) and the later Wittgenstein's meaning-as-use (as the general case where $\\eta$ captures experiential alignment).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Philosophical Therapy (哲学治疗)\n\n### The Author's Account\n\nIn K1策略, the author provides a structural account of why philosophical therapy works, centered on the concept of 张力 (tension) --- the state where a sub-category lacks a well-defined universal property, so that experience cannot resolve into a stable terminal point:\n\n> \"这也是哲学治疗为什么有效的原因\"\n\nThe author connects this to the idea that philosophical puzzlement arises from structural tension --- multiple potential universal properties competing without resolution --- and that therapy works by restructuring the category so that the tension is resolved.\n\n### Wittgenstein's Therapeutic Conception\n\nFor Wittgenstein, philosophical problems arise from linguistic confusions: \"philosophical problems arise when language goes on holiday\" (PI section 38). Therapy consists in \"assembling reminders for a particular purpose\" (PI section 127) --- drawing attention to how words are actually used so that the confused philosopher can see that there was no genuine problem.\n\n### The Tension\n\nThe author's account **explains** why therapy works; Wittgenstein would regard such an explanation as itself a philosophical confusion. Wittgenstein explicitly rejects the idea that philosophy should produce theories (PI section 109: \"we may not advance any kind of theory\"). For Wittgenstein, the therapeutic effect is self-evident once the confusion is cleared; there is nothing further to explain.\n\nHowever, the author's account does something that Wittgenstein's does not: it provides a **positive criterion** for when philosophical puzzlement should arise and when it should be resolved. By identifying puzzlement with categorical tension, the author can (in principle) predict which conceptual configurations will produce confusion and which will not. This is a genuinely productive extension, even if it violates Wittgenstein's quietism.\n\nFurthermore, the author's framework offers an interesting **bridge** between Wittgenstein's therapeutic approach and more constructive philosophical programs. If therapy works by resolving categorical tension, then constructive philosophy (building new frameworks, new concepts) is *also* a form of therapy --- it resolves tension not by showing that the question was confused, but by providing new categorical structure in which the tension can be resolved. This is close to what the author describes as the construction of 境.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Rule-Following and 恒常 (Constancy)\n\n### The Author's Account of Stable Structures\n\nThe concept of 恒常 (constancy) is introduced in 后形而上学 整理 as the core of metaphysical thinking:\n\n> \"形而上的核心是恒常。我们需要在变化的现象之中寻找到（追求）一种恒常性\"\n\nIn K1策略, this is formalized as stable structures $S_E$ preserved under the evolution functor $T$. The idea is that certain structural features of experience are invariant under experiential evolution --- they are the \"rules\" that constrain how experience can develop.\n\n### Wittgenstein's Rule-Following\n\nWittgenstein's rule-following considerations (PI sections 138--242) constitute one of the most profound and difficult passages in 20th-century philosophy. The central problem is: what constitutes following a rule? Wittgenstein argues against any **mentalist** or **Platonist** account of rules. A rule is not a mental state that determines its applications, nor is it an abstract object that we grasp. Rather, rule-following is a *practice* --- it consists in the regularity of a community's behavior, and there is no deeper fact that makes the behavior count as following *this* rule rather than *that* one.\n\nThe Kripkenstein paradox (Kripke's reading of Wittgenstein) sharpens this: for any finite sequence of applications, there are infinitely many rules consistent with that sequence. What determines that we are following addition rather than \"quaddition\"?\n\n### Comparison\n\nThe author's formalization of constancy as functorial invariance is in tension with Wittgenstein's anti-formalism in several ways:\n\n1. **Formalization vs. practice**: The author treats rules as mathematical invariants ($S_E$ preserved under $T$); Wittgenstein insists that rules are constituted by practice, not by any formal structure.\n\n2. **Community vs. individual**: Wittgenstein's rule-following requires a community of practitioners; the author's framework is largely individualistic (analyzing the evolution of a single person's $\\mathbb{E}_t$).\n\n3. **Determinacy**: The author's $S_E$ is (in principle) mathematically determinate; Wittgenstein argues that there is no fact of the matter about which rule is being followed apart from practice.\n\nHowever, the author's framework also has **surprising resonances** with Wittgenstein:\n\n1. **No ground-level rules**: The author explicitly states that $S_E$ is descriptive, not constitutive. The stable structures are observed regularities, not prescriptive rules. This is actually close to Wittgenstein's point: the \"rule\" is what we observe in practice, not a Platonic entity.\n\n2. **Non-uniqueness**: The author acknowledges that different choices of sub-categories and different time-ranges will yield different $S_E$. This echoes Wittgenstein's point that rule-following is context-dependent and community-relative.\n\n3. **The role of agreement**: When the author discusses philosophical experiments and the possibility of evoking shared experiences across different people, the criterion of success is structural agreement --- \"只需要他们具有相同的结构性位置.\" This is remarkably close to Wittgenstein's emphasis on \"agreement in form of life\" (PI section 241) as the basis for following the same rule.\n\n**Assessment**: The author formalizes what Wittgenstein deliberately left un-formalized. Whether this is a productive move or a misunderstanding depends on one's reading of Wittgenstein. On a therapeutic reading, it is a confusion. On a constructive reading (closer to Brandom or McDowell), it is a legitimate extension that preserves the anti-Platonist and practice-oriented spirit while adding mathematical precision.\n\n---\n\n## 6. On Certainty and the Knowledge Essay\n\n### The Author's Argument\n\nIn \"A Thought on Knowledge,\" the author argues that knowledge reduces to belief by analyzing each component of the traditional justified true belief (JTB) definition:\n\n1. **Truth condition**: methodologically impossible --- we have access only to phenomena, never to truth directly.\n2. **Justification condition**: all justification ultimately rests on phenomena or beliefs; phenomena must be \"digested\" into beliefs to be used; therefore justification is ultimately belief about belief.\n3. **Conclusion**: knowledge is, in practice, \"what each individual believes to be correct.\"\n\n### Wittgenstein's On Certainty\n\n*On Certainty* (OC), written in the last months of Wittgenstein's life, addresses Moore's \"proof of the external world.\" Wittgenstein argues that certain propositions function not as items of knowledge but as **hinge propositions** --- they are the framework within which knowledge claims, doubts, and justifications operate. \"The questions that we raise and our doubts depend on the fact that some propositions are exempt from doubt, as it were like hinges on which those turn\" (OC section 341).\n\nKey features of hinge propositions:\n- They are not known in the traditional sense; they are the **conditions** for knowing (OC section 403).\n- They cannot be justified, but this does not make them arbitrary (OC section 559).\n- They belong to a \"system\" or \"world-picture\" (*Weltbild*) (OC section 162).\n- They can change over time as practices change (OC section 96).\n\n### Connection\n\nThe author's analysis and Wittgenstein's *On Certainty* arrive at strikingly similar conclusions through different routes:\n\n1. **Foundationalism fails**: The author shows that justification bottoms out in unjustified belief or circular justification. Wittgenstein shows that justification bottoms out in hinge propositions that are not themselves justified.\n\n2. **Practice over theory**: The author repeatedly emphasizes \"in practice\" (在实践中) --- what people actually do when they claim to know something. Wittgenstein similarly focuses on what Moore *actually does* when he says \"I know this is a hand.\"\n\n3. **Knowledge as communal standard**: The author proposes that knowledge is \"what most people in a field believe to be correct.\" Wittgenstein's world-picture is similarly communal and practice-embedded.\n\n4. **Historical contingency**: The author notes that knowledge \"changes over time (e.g., geocentrism).\" Wittgenstein explicitly allows that hinge propositions can shift (OC section 96--99).\n\nHowever, there is a significant difference. Wittgenstein would resist the reduction of knowledge to belief. For Wittgenstein, hinge propositions are **neither** known **nor** believed --- they are the framework within which the distinction between knowledge and belief operates. The author's move is more radical: dissolving the knowledge/belief distinction entirely. This is closer to **pragmatism** (James, Dewey, Rorty) than to Wittgenstein, who preserves the grammar of \"knowing\" and \"believing\" even as he transforms their philosophical significance.\n\nThe author's analysis of scientific knowledge through the lens of high-energy physics (where \"fundamental particles\" are never directly observed, only electromagnetic signals in detectors that are then reconstructed through models) is particularly compelling and parallels Wittgenstein's observation in OC section 105: \"All testing, all confirmation and disconfirmation of a hypothesis takes place already within a system.\"\n\n---\n\n## 7. Private Language and Intersubjectivity\n\n### The Author's Position\n\nAcross the essays, the author repeatedly argues that we cannot access others' inner states:\n\n> \"人类不仅永远无法真正知道其他人的真实想法\" (关于集体利益)\n\n> \"我无法真正感受到他人的内心感受\" (后形而上学 整理)\n\nYet the author proposes a criterion for communication and intersubjective verification:\n\n> \"我们不需要本体论的验证不同的人获得了'同一'体验（例如Qualia），只需要他们具有相同的结构性位置\" (K1策略)\n\n### Wittgenstein's Private Language Argument\n\nWittgenstein's private language argument (PI sections 243--315) argues that a language whose terms refer to the speaker's private sensations, knowable only to the speaker, is impossible. The key moves:\n\n1. A private linguist cannot establish a criterion of correctness for their sensation-terms (PI section 258).\n2. Without such a criterion, there is no distinction between following a rule and merely thinking one is following a rule (PI section 202).\n3. Therefore, the meaning of sensation-terms must be grounded in public, shared practices.\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe author's position is **deeply compatible** with the private language argument, perhaps more than the author realizes. Consider:\n\n1. **Structural position as public criterion**: The author's proposal that shared experience is verified by \"structural position\" rather than by qualitative identity is exactly the kind of **public criterion** that Wittgenstein argues sensation-terms must have. We don't need to verify that your red *feels* the same as my red; we need only verify that \"red\" occupies the same structural position in both our linguistic/experiential networks.\n\n2. **Rejection of private access**: The author's insistence that we cannot know others' inner states, combined with the claim that structural verification suffices for communication, mirrors Wittgenstein's point that the \"private object\" drops out as irrelevant to meaning (PI section 293, the \"beetle in the box\" passage).\n\n3. **Category-theoretic formalization**: The author's framework provides a precise mathematical formulation of what \"same structural position\" means: isomorphic placement within a categorical structure. This goes beyond what Wittgenstein offers but is entirely consistent with his philosophical conclusions.\n\nWhere the author diverges from Wittgenstein is in maintaining that there genuinely *are* inner states that we cannot access --- the framework preserves subjective experience as ontologically real even if epistemically inaccessible. Wittgenstein, by contrast, argues that the very picture of \"inner states\" that others cannot access is confused: \"The essential thing about private experience is really not that each person possesses his own exemplar, but that nobody knows whether other people also have this or something else\" (PI section 272). For Wittgenstein, this \"not knowing\" is not an epistemic limitation but a grammatical observation --- the concept of \"knowing another's sensation\" has no clear application.\n\n**Assessment**: The author's structural verification criterion is one of the most philosophically productive ideas in the collection, and it can be read as a **constructive implementation** of Wittgenstein's insight that meaning is public. The category-theoretic apparatus provides precisely the tools needed to make \"same structural position\" rigorous. For the full account of how the natural transformation $\\eta$ serves as the mechanism of intersubjective verification --- and how the naturality condition itself functions as the public criterion, giving mathematical content to the beetle-in-the-box insight --- see Supplementary Section S1 below.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Forms of Life and 境/梦境\n\n### Wittgenstein's Forms of Life (Lebensformen)\n\n\"Forms of life\" is one of the most evocative and under-determined concepts in Wittgenstein. It appears only a handful of times in the *Investigations* (PI sections 19, 23, 241; PI p. 226). Its precise meaning is debated, but the central idea is that language games are embedded in broader patterns of human activity, behavior, and agreement. \"To imagine a language means to imagine a form of life\" (PI section 19).\n\nForms of life are:\n- **Not reducible to rules or structures**: they include the \"weave of life\" --- behaviors, reactions, training, natural history.\n- **The given**: \"What has to be accepted, the given, is --- so one could say --- forms of life\" (PI p. 226).\n- **Neither subjective nor objective**: they are the shared background against which subjectivity and objectivity make sense.\n\n### The Author's 境 and 梦境\n\nThe author's 境 ($\\mathbb{E}$) is defined as a categorical structure on phenomena ($\\mathfrak{P}$): experiences as objects, associations (联想) as morphisms, forming a tower structure. 梦境 is the \"environment\" in which meaning becomes possible --- the \"packaging\" of experience within which purposes and significance arise.\n\n### Comparison\n\nThere are genuine parallels:\n\n1. **Background for meaning**: Both forms of life and 境 serve as the background against which meaning, understanding, and purpose operate. Neither is itself an object of direct scrutiny --- both are the medium *in which* we think and act.\n\n2. **Given-ness**: The author's insistence that we cannot escape all 境 (\"抛弃所有的梦境即是不可能的\") parallels Wittgenstein's claim that forms of life are \"the given.\"\n\n3. **Multiplicity**: The author allows for multiple sub-categories ($\\mathcal{E}_L$, $\\mathcal{E}_M$, $\\mathcal{E}_K$) within $\\mathbb{E}$; Wittgenstein allows for multiple, overlapping forms of life.\n\nHowever, the differences are also significant:\n\n1. **Formalization**: 境 is explicitly formalized using category theory; Wittgenstein's forms of life are deliberately left informal. Wittgenstein would likely regard the formalization as a category mistake --- forms of life are not the kind of thing that *can* be formalized, because they include precisely those aspects of human activity that resist formalization.\n\n2. **Individualism vs. communalism**: 境 is fundamentally individual (each person has their own $\\mathbb{E}_t$); forms of life are fundamentally communal (they are shared patterns of activity). This is a deep philosophical difference. The author addresses intersubjectivity through structural correspondence, but the starting point is the individual subject.\n\n3. **Static vs. dynamic**: The author's 境 evolves ($T_t: \\mathbb{E}_t \\to \\mathbb{E}_{t+1}$); Wittgenstein's forms of life are relatively stable (they change historically but are not theorized as evolving).\n\n4. **Dreamscape metaphor**: 梦境 (dreamscape) --- particularly the distinction between 沉醉 (immersed/intoxicated) and 清醒 (lucid/awake) --- introduces an element of **self-awareness** that has no direct parallel in Wittgenstein. The idea of a \"lucid dream\" where one is fully invested yet fully aware of the constructed nature of the meaning-structure goes beyond Wittgenstein's framework. This is more reminiscent of Heidegger's distinction between authentic and inauthentic existence, or of the Buddhist concept of mindfulness within samsara.\n\n**Assessment**: 境 is best understood not as a formalization of Wittgenstein's forms of life, but as a **parallel concept** developed from different philosophical motivations. Forms of life are the communal background of meaning; 境 is the individual structural medium of experience. The two concepts address overlapping philosophical territory but from different starting points and with different emphases.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Translation Challenges\n\n### Key Terms with Wittgensteinian Resonance\n\nThe following terms require careful handling in translation due to their proximity to --- but divergence from --- established Wittgensteinian terminology:\n\n**语言游戏 (language games)**: The standard translation of Wittgenstein's *Sprachspiele* is \"language games.\" The author uses the same Chinese term but with a different emphasis: as a methodological tool for discovering stable structures rather than as the bedrock of meaning. Translators should use \"language games\" but add a note distinguishing the author's usage from Wittgenstein's. Consider: \"language games (in the methodological sense)\" on first occurrence, then simply \"language games\" thereafter.\n\n**哲学治疗 (philosophical therapy)**: This translates straightforwardly as \"philosophical therapy,\" which is the standard rendering of Wittgenstein's concept. But since the author gives it a structural explanation (resolution of categorical tension), a translator's note should clarify the difference.\n\n**结构 (structure)** and **意义 (meaning)**: These are the central terms in the structure/meaning question. \"Structure\" and \"meaning\" are straightforward, but the translator should be aware that the author's use of \"meaning\" is experiential/phenomenological rather than truth-conditional or referential.\n\n**理解 (understanding) vs. 掌握 (mastery/grasp)**: This distinction is philosophically crucial. The author defines 掌握 as the special case where $\\eta_a$ is the identity --- a \"direct confirmation sense\" without mediation. This corresponds to what Wittgenstein calls \"understanding\" in its most robust sense. I recommend translating 理解 as \"understanding\" and 掌握 as \"mastery\" or \"direct grasp,\" with a note explaining that the latter is a technical term in the author's framework corresponding to the identity natural transformation.\n\n**恒常 (constancy)**: This is the author's term for the invariance at the heart of metaphysics. \"Constancy\" is adequate but risks confusion with Husserl's \"constancy\" (*Bestandigkeit*). \"Invariance\" captures the mathematical sense better, but \"constancy\" preserves the more phenomenological register. I recommend \"constancy\" with a parenthetical \"(invariance)\" on first occurrence.\n\n**境**: See the full dictionary entry below. This is the most challenging term.\n\n**规则 (rules)**: Standard translation. But note that the author's \"rules\" are stable structures ($S_E$), not Wittgensteinian rule-following practices.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Overall Significance\n\n### Does the Framework Achieve Something Wittgenstein Attempted?\n\nThe relationship between this framework and Wittgenstein's philosophy is best characterized as **complementary rather than duplicative**. Wittgenstein sought to dissolve philosophical problems by showing that they arise from linguistic confusions. The author seeks to **describe the structure of experience** in a way that makes philosophical problems tractable --- either dissolvable (by showing that they arise from categorical tension) or answerable (by mapping experiential structures through formal tools).\n\nThe deepest convergence is in the **anti-foundationalist** character of both projects:\n- Wittgenstein: there is no foundation beneath language games and forms of life; they are the given.\n- The author: there is no 第〇实在 (zeroth reality) accessible to us; phenomena are the 第一实在 (first reality), and all metaphysics is constructed *upon* phenomena.\n\nThe deepest divergence is in their attitudes toward **formalization**:\n- Wittgenstein: formalization is part of the disease, not the cure. Philosophical problems arise precisely from our attempt to force the richness of language use into formal molds.\n- The author: formalization (specifically, category theory) is a useful tool that, properly wielded, can illuminate the structure of experience without claiming to capture its essence.\n\n### Is the Category-Theoretic Formalization Productive?\n\nI believe it is, for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Natural transformations capture something real about understanding**. The idea that understanding is the alignment between structural evolution and experiential evolution, formalized as a natural transformation, is a genuinely illuminating philosophical proposal. It gives mathematical content to the vague notion of \"grasping\" meaning, and it does so in a way that is consistent with Wittgensteinian insights about the primacy of use and practice.\n\n2. **The structural verification criterion resolves a genuine problem**. Wittgenstein's private language argument establishes that meaning must be public, but it does not provide a positive account of *how* public meaning works. The author's structural position criterion fills this gap.\n\n3. **The framework is self-limiting**. The author repeatedly insists on the descriptive (rather than constitutive) character of the framework, and on the tool-like status of category theory. This self-limitation prevents the framework from falling into the kind of metaphysical dogmatism that Wittgenstein criticizes.\n\n4. **Connection to empirical verification**. The proposal for \"philosophical experiments\" --- constructing experiences with specific structural properties and verifying that they evoke the predicted experiential responses --- is a genuinely novel contribution to philosophical methodology. This goes beyond what Wittgenstein, the formal semanticists, or the speech act theorists have proposed.\n\nHowever, a Wittgensteinian critic would rightly note:\n- The framework may create new philosophical confusions even as it resolves old ones (e.g., reifying \"stable structures\" in experience).\n- The mathematical apparatus may obscure rather than illuminate for readers not trained in category theory.\n- The individualist starting point may miss the essentially communal character of meaning that Wittgenstein emphasizes.\n\n### Positioning in the Field\n\nWithin contemporary philosophy of language, this framework occupies a distinctive position:\n- It shares **inferentialism's** (Brandom) emphasis on structural relations over reference, but replaces inferential roles with categorical structures.\n- It shares **dynamic semantics'** emphasis on meaning as process, but operates at a more fundamental level (experience rather than discourse).\n- It shares **phenomenology's** (Husserl, Heidegger) emphasis on lived experience, but provides mathematical tools for structural analysis.\n- It inherits **Wittgenstein's** anti-foundationalism and emphasis on practice, but converts therapeutic insights into constructive resources.\n\nThe result is something genuinely new: a **structural phenomenology of meaning** that uses category theory as its formal backbone. Whether this will prove philosophically fruitful in the long run depends on whether the framework can generate specific, testable insights about the structure of understanding --- and the author's proposal for philosophical experiments suggests a path toward doing exactly that.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix: Notes on Individual Essays\n\n### 关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一\nFrom a philosophy of language perspective, the most interesting move here is the analogy between macro-level concepts (collective interest) and the renormalization group in physics. This parallels Wittgenstein's observation that concepts can operate at different \"levels\" without reducing to their micro-level constituents (cf. PI section 71 on family resemblance). The author's claim that \"人类不仅永远无法真正知道其他人的真实想法\" anticipates the private language considerations developed more fully in later essays.\n\n### A Thought on Knowledge\nThis essay is the most directly relevant to analytic epistemology and to *On Certainty*. The systematic stripping away of JTB components is clear and effective. The approach of focusing on \"how we access\" justification bases rather than \"what they are\" is thoroughly Wittgensteinian in spirit.\n\n### 西西弗斯、班与猫\nThe dissolution of absurdism through the concept of internally generated meaning (养猫) is philosophically elegant. From a Wittgensteinian perspective, the key insight is that meaning does not require articulation or justification --- the cat-owner does not need to state *why* cat care is meaningful. This resonates with Wittgenstein's observation that forms of life do not require external justification; they are the given.\n\n### 后形而上学 整理\nThe layered analysis of metaphysics (Types 0-3) and the \"inversion\" of 道德仁义礼 is sophisticated. The concept of 恒常 as the core of metaphysical thinking is a genuine contribution. The distinction between 第一实在 (phenomena) and 第二实在 (constructed reality) maps partially onto Wittgenstein's distinction between what is given and what is constructed in language, though the author's framework is more explicitly ontological.\n\n### 形而上学后的目的：诗意\nThe distinction between 沉醉 (immersed) and 清醒 (lucid) dreamscapes is philosophically original. It offers a way of being meaning-engaged that is neither naive (pre-critical) nor nihilistic (post-critical). This has no direct Wittgensteinian parallel but is consistent with the later Wittgenstein's acceptance of forms of life as \"the given.\"\n\n### 范畴论与境 整理\nThis is where the formal apparatus is developed. The identification of associations (联想) with morphisms, and the tower structure of experience, are the framework's most technically innovative features. The examples (Ship of Theseus, \"what is a person?\", dragon's blood) effectively illustrate how the formal tools apply to traditional philosophical problems.\n\n### 范畴论与境：K1策略\nThis is the framework's culminating essay. The natural transformation analysis of understanding, the structural verification criterion, and the proposal for philosophical experiments are the most philosophically significant contributions. The explicit engagement with language games and philosophical therapy shows the author's awareness of the Wittgensteinian tradition.\n\n### 关于诗意和境的一些零散想法\nThis collection of notes extends and applies the framework. The self-referential observation that we are already constructing 境 in everyday life --- choosing clothes, decorating rooms, taking photographs --- grounds the abstract framework in lived practice, which is the most Wittgensteinian gesture in the entire collection.\n\n---\n\n## Supplementary Analysis: Two Follow-Up Topics\n\n### S1. Intersubjectivity via the Natural Transformation $\\eta$\n\nThe author suggests that the natural transformation $\\eta$ is the mechanism through which intersubjective verification is possible. Let me trace how this works and assess it from a Wittgensteinian perspective.\n\n#### The Mechanism\n\nConsider two people, Alice and Bob, both reading the sentence \"The cat jumped on the table\" (猫跳上了桌子). In K1策略, understanding this sentence requires a natural transformation between the sentence's structural evolution (its syntactic unfolding) and one's experiential evolution (the mental simulation of the event). If Alice has an $\\eta^A$ and Bob has an $\\eta^B$, the question of intersubjectivity becomes: do Alice and Bob understand the same thing?\n\nThe author's answer (K1策略 methodology point 3) is that we do not need ontological verification that $\\eta^A$ and $\\eta^B$ are qualitatively identical --- we need only that they occupy the same **structural position**. That is, if Alice's $\\eta^A$ relates the same objects and morphisms in the same way as Bob's $\\eta^B$, then their understanding is commensurable.\n\nMore precisely: the naturality condition requires that $\\eta$ commutes with all morphisms in the source category. This means $\\eta$ is not a free-floating subjective response but a **structurally constrained** response. Two people whose $\\eta$'s satisfy the same naturality diagrams are, in a rigorous mathematical sense, aligned --- even if the \"felt quality\" of their $\\eta$'s differs. The commutative diagram itself is the public, shareable criterion of understanding.\n\n#### Wittgensteinian Assessment\n\nThis is, I believe, the most philosophically significant move in the entire collection, and it represents a **genuine advance** on the intersubjectivity problem that goes beyond what Wittgenstein himself achieved. Here is why.\n\nWittgenstein's treatment of intersubjectivity operates on two levels:\n\n1. **The Private Language Argument (PI sections 243--315)**: Meaning must be public. The \"beetle in the box\" thought experiment (PI section 293) shows that if everyone has a box with something in it that only they can see, the \"something\" drops out of the language game --- what matters is the *role* of \"beetle\" in our shared practice, not its private content.\n\n2. **Agreement in Form of Life (PI section 241)**: \"So you are saying that human agreement decides what is true and what is false?\" --- \"It is what human beings *say* that is true and false; and they agree in the *language* they use. That is not agreement in opinions but in form of life.\"\n\nWittgenstein establishes that meaning is public and that intersubjective agreement is grounded in shared form of life. But he does not provide a **mechanism** for how this works. He would resist providing one, on therapeutic grounds --- the question \"how does intersubjective understanding work?\" is, for the quietist, already a confused question (understanding is not a process; cf. PI section 154).\n\nThe author's natural transformation framework provides what Wittgenstein deliberately withholds: a **positive structural account** of intersubjective alignment. The key insight is that **the naturality condition is itself the public criterion**. Consider:\n\n- The naturality square for $\\eta$ is a mathematical structure that can be checked, tested, and communicated.\n- Two people who both satisfy the naturality condition for the same source category are provably aligned in their structural responses.\n- This alignment does not require access to anyone's private experience --- it requires only that both people's responses are coherent with the same categorical structure.\n\nThis is precisely analogous to Wittgenstein's beetle-in-the-box: the private content ($\\eta^A$ vs $\\eta^B$ as felt experiences) drops out; what remains is the structural role ($\\eta$ as a natural transformation satisfying commutative diagrams). The author has given **mathematical content** to the beetle-in-the-box insight.\n\nFurthermore, the naturality condition addresses the **Kripkenstein problem** (Kripke's skeptical reading of Wittgenstein on rule-following). Kripke asks: what fact about me determines that I mean addition rather than \"quaddition\" by \"+\"? The author's framework suggests an answer: the fact that my $\\eta$ satisfies the naturality condition for the categorical structure of arithmetic. If my $\\eta$ is natural (commutes with all morphisms), then my understanding is structurally determined --- there is no room for quaddition-like deviance, because the naturality condition constrains $\\eta$ globally, not just at finitely many points. This is not Kripke's \"skeptical solution\" (meaning as community agreement) but something closer to a **structural solution**: meaning is fixed by the naturality constraint itself.\n\nHowever, a Wittgensteinian would raise the following concern: **who verifies the naturality condition?** If Alice checks whether Bob's $\\eta$ commutes with all morphisms, she must access Bob's $\\eta$ --- which is, by hypothesis, an experience in Bob's $\\mathbb{E}$. The author's response would presumably be the philosophical experiment methodology: construct situations designed to test whether specific components of $\\eta$ are present, and check for replicable behavioral responses. This converts the naturality check into an empirical procedure, which is consistent with Wittgenstein's emphasis on practice. But it also shows that **intersubjective verification is always partial and practical** --- we can check finitely many components of $\\eta$ through experiments, but we can never verify the full naturality condition. This partial, practical character is, I think, exactly right, and it is exactly what Wittgenstein would predict: agreement is always agreement in what we *do*, not in some metaphysical fact about shared understanding.\n\n**Key conclusion**: The natural transformation $\\eta$ provides a **structural criterion for intersubjective commensurability** that is (1) consistent with the private language argument's conclusion that meaning is public, (2) more specific than Wittgenstein's appeal to \"agreement in form of life,\" and (3) potentially testable through the philosophical experiment methodology. This is a genuine contribution to philosophy of language.\n\n#### Translation Note (Addendum to Dictionary)\n\nThe term 主体间性 should be translated as **intersubjectivity**. In the author's framework, intersubjectivity is not grounded in empathy, shared consciousness, or transcendental structures, but in **structural commensurability** --- the sharing of naturality conditions. This is distinct from Husserl's intersubjectivity (grounded in empathic appresentation), Habermas's (grounded in communicative rationality), and Wittgenstein's (grounded in agreement in form of life). The author's is perhaps closest to Brandom's inferentialism, where intersubjectivity is constituted by the mutual recognition of inferential commitments.\n\n---\n\n### S2. The Essays as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThe author proposes that \"philosophical experiments\" consist in constructing examples with specific structures to awaken specific experiences in readers, then checking whether those experiences are replicable (K1策略, methodology point 3). The author further suggests in \"写在最后\" that this practice is already ubiquitous: poetry, literature, art, music, games, memes, and even decorating one's room are all instances of constructing 境 to awaken experience.\n\nRe-reading the essays with this lens reveals that **several passages are indeed functioning as philosophical experiments** --- they are not merely *describing* philosophical positions but are actively *constructing* experiential structures in the reader. Let me identify the most significant instances.\n\n#### Experiment 1: The Sisyphus/Cat Essay as Dissolution of Absurdity\n\nThe essay 西西弗斯、班与猫 has a very specific argumentative structure that functions as a philosophical experiment:\n\n1. **Setup (establishing the target experience)**: The reader is invited to feel the absurdity of Sisyphus's situation, and then the absurdity of the office worker's situation. These are familiar scenarios; most readers will have a pre-existing $\\eta$ that connects \"repetitive labor\" with \"absurdity.\"\n\n2. **Pivot (disrupting the structural alignment)**: The author introduces the entrepreneur --- structurally identical labor, but no absurdity. This forces the reader to notice that their $\\eta$ between \"repetition\" and \"absurdity\" was not intrinsic but contingent on **alienation** (the meaning being external).\n\n3. **Dissolution (constructing a new $\\eta$)**: The cat example. Here the author constructs a scenario that is structurally identical to Sisyphus (repetitive, effortful, no cosmic purpose) but where the experience of absurdity is simply **absent**. The rhetorical force of this example depends on the reader *actually experiencing* the absence of absurdity when thinking about cat care. The sentence \"没有一个养猫的人会感到荒谬，荒谬从未来过\" is designed to trigger the reader's introspective verification: *Is this true? Do I feel absurdity when I think about caring for a cat?* The expected answer is no, and this no is itself the philosophical experiment's result.\n\nFrom a Wittgensteinian perspective, this is a paradigmatic example of **philosophical therapy conducted through examples** --- exactly what Wittgenstein does in the *Investigations*. Consider PI section 66, where Wittgenstein asks the reader to \"look and see\" whether there is something common to all games. The rhetorical structure is identical: Wittgenstein constructs a series of examples, invites the reader to introspect, and expects a specific experiential result (the *absence* of a common feature). The cat example works the same way: the author constructs a scenario, invites introspection, and expects the *absence* of absurdity.\n\nWhat makes this a philosophical *experiment* rather than merely a philosophical *argument* is that **the reader's introspective response is the evidence**. If the reader *does* feel absurdity when thinking about cat care, the experiment has failed for that reader, and the philosophical claim is not established. The claim is empirical-experiential, not logically necessary.\n\nThis is genuinely Wittgensteinian in method, even if the author's framework provides a more structural account of *why* the method works (the examples construct specific categorical structures that do or do not support a natural transformation involving \"absurdity\").\n\n#### Experiment 2: The 道德仁义礼 Reversal as Restructuring of the Reader's 境\n\nThe 道德仁义礼 passage in 后形而上学 整理 functions as a different kind of philosophical experiment --- one aimed at **restructuring** the reader's 境 rather than dissolving a specific feeling.\n\nThe passage proceeds in several steps:\n\n1. **The traditional ordering is presented**: 道 -> 德 -> 仁 -> 义 -> 礼. This is the familiar top-down metaphysical picture. Most readers educated in Chinese philosophy will have an existing $\\eta$ aligning this ordering with their understanding of the concepts.\n\n2. **The author introduces \"现象礼\"**: The reader is asked to recall the actual *experience* of ritual behavior --- how it feels, from the inside, to behave ritually toward others. This is a request for introspection.\n\n3. **The reversal is performed step by step**: 现象礼 -> 现象义 -> 现象仁 -> 德 -> 道. Each step is justified by appeal to the reader's own experience: \"this feeling is what you actually experience\" (切实感受到的). The reader is being guided through a reconstruction of their own experiential categories.\n\n4. **The inversion is made explicit**: \"整个逻辑的顺序就被倒反过来.\" The reader is invited to experience the *shift* --- the moment when the traditional ordering \"flips\" and the reader sees that what they took to be foundational (道) was actually derived (from 现象礼).\n\nFrom a Wittgensteinian perspective, this is a **perspicuous presentation** (*ubersichtliche Darstellung*, PI section 122) --- a rearrangement of what was already known that produces a new way of seeing. Wittgenstein's own method in the *Investigations* is precisely this: he does not introduce new facts but rearranges familiar facts so that we see them differently. The duck-rabbit (PI p. 194) is the iconic example: the same figure, seen differently.\n\nBut the 道德仁义礼 passage is more than a static perspicuous presentation --- it is a **guided restructuring** of the reader's experiential categories. The reader's $\\mathcal{E}$ is being actively reorganized: the meta-order of 道, 德, 仁, 义, 礼 is being inverted. If the experiment succeeds, the reader emerges with a different categorical structure --- one where phenomena are foundational and metaphysical concepts are derived. This is a restructuring of the reader's 境 itself.\n\nThis is something Wittgenstein does implicitly but never theorizes. The author, by providing the category-theoretic framework, can now describe *what happens* when a philosophical example restructures one's understanding: it changes the meta-ordering of objects in $\\mathcal{E}$, potentially changing which objects serve as universal properties, and thereby changing the reader's metaphysical commitments.\n\n#### Experiment 3: The \"1+1=2\" Passage as Evoking $\\eta$\n\nIn K1策略, the passage where the author asks the reader to introspect on the experience of understanding \"1+1=2\" is itself a philosophical experiment. The reader is asked:\n\n- Do you experience a \"direct confirmation sense\" when you see \"1+1=2\"?\n- Is this different from the experience of checking your answer against a reference?\n- Can you recognize the experience of $\\eta$ as identity (掌握) versus $\\eta$ as non-trivial (理解 without 掌握)?\n\nThe passage about the meme sentence \"你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国，记住我给出的原理\" is particularly effective: the reader is asked to notice the *failure* of $\\eta$ --- the experience of **not understanding** despite grammatical correctness. This negative result (the absence of alignment) is just as experimentally significant as the positive case.\n\n#### Experiment 4: The 忒修斯之船 (Ship of Theseus) as Evoking the Universal Property\n\nIn 范畴论与境 整理, the Ship of Theseus discussion asks the reader to introspect: \"When you think of the Ship of Theseus, what do you experience?\" The expected answer is a specific *feeling* --- the feeling that accompanies the concept of this particular ship, which is the universal property of the sub-category $\\mathcal{E}_{\\text{Theseus}}$. The author then shows that choosing $\\mathfrak{P}$ as the physical world leads to the paradox (the universal property becomes \"emptiness\"), while choosing $\\mathfrak{P}$ as phenomena resolves it (the universal property is the *feeling* of \"this ship\"). The reader is invited to verify this through introspection: \"Is the identity of the Ship of Theseus located in the physical planks or in my experience of the ship?\"\n\n#### Wittgensteinian Assessment of the Experimental Method\n\nWittgenstein would have a complex reaction to the philosophical experiment methodology:\n\n**What he would endorse**: The centrality of concrete examples, the appeal to introspective verification, the refusal to argue from abstract principles alone. These are all Wittgensteinian virtues. PI section 593: \"A main cause of philosophical disease --- a one-sided diet: one nourishes one's thinking with only one kind of example.\"\n\n**What he would resist**: The idea that introspective responses can be treated as *data* for a structural theory. For Wittgenstein, the examples are **self-sufficient** --- they do not serve a higher theoretical purpose. They are not evidence for a theory about natural transformations; they are the thing itself. The moment you treat introspective responses as data points in a structural theory, you have, from Wittgenstein's perspective, taken a step away from the phenomena and toward a philosophical construction.\n\n**What is genuinely new**: The author's key innovation is the claim that philosophical experiments can be designed *in advance* by specifying the categorical structure that should evoke the target experience. This is the reverse of Wittgenstein's method: Wittgenstein finds examples that dissolve existing confusions; the author proposes to *construct* examples that produce *specific predicted* experiences. This is a move from therapeutic philosophy to what we might call **constructive experimental phenomenology**. It has no precedent in Wittgenstein, though it has affinities with Austin's method of constructing specific speech-act scenarios to test linguistic intuitions. (Austin also believed that carefully constructed examples could serve as evidence for philosophical claims about language.)\n\n**The deepest insight**: The author's observation that the essays *themselves* are philosophical experiments --- not just descriptions of a theory but active interventions in the reader's experiential structure --- collapses the distinction between philosophical writing and philosophical practice. This is actually the most Wittgensteinian thing in the entire collection, because it embodies Wittgenstein's claim that philosophy is an *activity* (Tractatus 4.112), not a body of doctrine. The essays do not merely *say* that meaning is experiential alignment; they *show* it by constructing experiences in the reader. The medium is the message. This is philosophy as performance, as practice --- which is, in the end, what Wittgenstein always insisted philosophy should be.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":286,"oldLines":6,"newStart":286,"newLines":22,"lines":[" "," **规则 (rules)**: Standard translation.

Language Games in the Framework\n\n### The Author's Usage of 语言游戏 (Language Games)\n\nIn K1策略, the author explicitly invokes the concept of 语言游戏 (language games) as a method for investigating stable structures ($S_L$) within the linguistic sub-category $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$. The key passage states:\n\n> \"于是我们就可以通过语言游戏研究语言演化中的稳定结构 $S_L$，来间接获得对 $\\mathbb{E}_t$ 中 $S_E$ 的认识\"\n\nThis usage represents a **productive but significantly reoriented extension** of Wittgenstein's concept. In the *Philosophical Investigations*, language games serve multiple functions: they are simplified models of language use (PI section 2), they illustrate the multiplicity and heterogeneity of linguistic practices (PI section 23), and they are bound up with \"forms of life\" (PI section 23). Crucially, for Wittgenstein, language games are **not instruments for discovering underlying structures**. They are the thing itself --- the level at which meaning operates. There is no deeper structure that language games reveal; rather, language games *are* the bedrock.\n\nThe author, by contrast, treats language games as **probes** --- methodological instruments that, through the functor $(F_{E,L})_t$, can map linguistic stable structures onto experiential stable structures. This is closer to what we might call a **constructive-structuralist** appropriation of language games. Wittgenstein would likely resist this move, since for him the idea that language games reveal hidden invariants would itself be a philosophical confusion --- the very kind of theorizing he sought to dissolve.\n\nHowever, the author's framework is more subtle than a naive structuralism. The author acknowledges that the mapping $(F_{E,L})_t(S_L) \\approx S_E$ is only approximate, that it captures at best a partial overlap, and that the relationship is descriptive rather than constitutive. This qualification brings the author somewhat closer to Wittgenstein's therapeutic spirit: the framework does not claim to have found the *essence* of meaning, but rather offers a tool for mapping certain structural relationships.\n\n### Therapeutic vs. Constructive Conceptions\n\nWittgenstein's conception of philosophy is famously therapeutic: \"The philosopher treats a question; like an illness\" (PI section 255). The aim is not to construct theories but to dissolve confusions by achieving a \"perspicuous presentation\" (*ubersichtliche Darstellung*, PI section 122). PI section 133 states: \"The real discovery is the one that enables me to break off doing philosophy when I want to.\"\n\nThe author explicitly mentions 哲学治疗 (philosophical therapy) in K1策略 and claims that the framework explains why it works --- roughly, through the resolution of \"tension\" (张力) when experiential sub-categories lack a well-defined universal property. This is a **structural explanation of why therapy works**, which is itself a constructive philosophical move. Wittgenstein would not attempt to explain *why* therapy works in structural-mathematical terms; for him, the therapy works by showing us the way out of the fly-bottle (PI section 309), not by constructing a formal account of fly-bottles.\n\n**Assessment**: The author's use of language games is a **departure** from Wittgenstein's anti-theoretical stance, but it is a **self-aware departure**. The author does not claim to be doing what Wittgenstein did; rather, the author uses Wittgenstein's concept as one input among many in a constructive framework. This is closer to how Robert Brandom appropriates Wittgenstein --- taking the insight about the primacy of practice and embedding it within a systematic philosophical project --- than to the quietist reading of Wittgenstein associated with Cora Diamond and James Conant.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Meaning and Structure: 是结构先于意义，还是意义先于结构？\n\n### The Author's Resolution via Natural Transformations\n\nIn K1策略, the author asks: does structure precede meaning, or meaning precede structure? The resolution is given through the natural transformation framework:\n\n> \"结构和意义之间的关系是自然变换：一句话能够被理解，他必须能够在心理过程的演化和结构的演化中达成如上所述的这种一致性感受$\\eta$\"\n\nThis is a striking move. The author refuses the dichotomy by arguing that structure and meaning are related by a **natural transformation** --- neither generates the other, but they must be **aligned**. Understanding ($\\eta$) is precisely the experience of this alignment.\n\n### Relation to Wittgenstein's Meaning-as-Use\n\nWittgenstein's meaning-as-use thesis (PI section 43: \"the meaning of a word is its use in the language\") dissolves the structure/meaning dichotomy from a different direction. For Wittgenstein, there is no pre-linguistic meaning that structure then encodes, nor is there a pure structure that then generates meaning. Meaning simply *is* the pattern of use within a language game embedded in a form of life.\n\nThe author's framework can be read as a **formalization of why Wittgenstein's dissolution works**. If structure and meaning are related by natural transformation rather than by generation, then asking which comes first is indeed a confused question --- just as Wittgenstein suggests. The natural transformation framework gives mathematical content to the Wittgensteinian insight that meaning and use are co-constitutive.\n\nHowever, there is a crucial difference. For Wittgenstein, meaning-as-use is meant to *stop* philosophical theorizing about meaning. The point is that once we see that meaning is use, there is nothing further to explain. The author, by contrast, uses the dissolution of the dichotomy as a *starting point* for further structural analysis. This is characteristic of the author's general approach: taking Wittgensteinian therapeutic insights and converting them into constructive theoretical resources.\n\n### Contrast with Formal Semantics\n\nIn truth-conditional formal semantics (Montague, Davidson, Tarski), meaning is identified with truth-conditions, and structure (syntactic/logical form) determines meaning via compositional rules. This is a clear \"structure precedes meaning\" position. The author's framework differs from this in several ways:\n\n1. **No appeal to truth**: The author's framework, consistent with the Knowledge essay, does not invoke truth-conditions. Meaning is experiential alignment ($\\eta$), not truth-value assignment.\n2. **Bidirectionality**: Formal semantics maps structure to meaning; the author's natural transformation allows influence in both directions.\n3. **Dynamic character**: Formal semantics is typically static (a sentence has its meaning at a time); the author's framework is inherently evolutionary ($t \\to t+1$).\n\nThe author's position has more in common with **dynamic semantics** (Kamp, Heim, Groenendijk & Stokhof) and with **inferentialist semantics** (Brandom), where meaning is constituted by inferential role and responsive to context, than with classical Montague grammar.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The Picture Theory and Natural Transformations\n\n### Tractatus Picture Theory\n\nThe early Wittgenstein's picture theory (Tractatus 2.1--2.225) posits that propositions are pictures of reality. A picture shares \"logical form\" with what it depicts (T 2.18). The picture \"reaches up to reality\" (T 2.1511) through a structural isomorphism between the elements of the picture and the elements of the state of affairs.\n\n### The Author's Natural Transformation Framework\n\nThe author's framework posits that understanding occurs when the evolution of a formal structure (e.g., mathematics, language) and the evolution of experience are related by a natural transformation. The $\\eta_a$ component measures the alignment between two paths from structure to experience.\n\n### Comparison\n\nThere is a **genuine structural parallel**. Both frameworks posit that the relationship between language/formalism and reality/experience is mediated by **structural correspondence**. However, the differences are substantial:\n\n| Feature | Tractatus Picture Theory | Author's Framework |\n|---|---|---|\n| Correspondence type | Isomorphism (static) | Natural transformation (dynamic) |\n| What corresponds | Proposition and state of affairs | Structural evolution and experiential evolution |\n| Nature of correspondence | Logical form shared | Alignment ($\\eta$) experienced |\n| Status of correspondence | Metaphysical necessity | Empirical/experiential claim |\n| Directionality | One-way (picture depicts) | Bidirectional (natural transformation) |\n\nThe author's framework can be read as a **category-theoretic generalization** of the picture theory in the following precise sense: where the Tractatus requires a *single* structural isomorphism between a proposition and a fact, the author requires a *family* of morphisms ($\\eta_a$) that are *natural* (coherent across all objects and morphisms). The naturality condition is the key upgrade --- it captures not just point-by-point correspondence but **systematic coherence** across the entire categorical structure.\n\nMoreover, the author's framework **inherits the later Wittgenstein's corrections** to the picture theory. The Tractatus picture theory fails because it cannot account for the diversity of language uses (commands, jokes, prayers, greetings --- none of which \"picture\" anything). The author's framework avoids this by making the relevant correspondence *experiential* rather than *representational*. Understanding a joke is having the right $\\eta$ between the joke's structural unfolding and one's experiential response --- no picturing required.\n\n**Assessment**: The author's framework is best understood not as a generalization of the picture theory *per se*, but as a framework that **subsumes both** the picture theory (as a special case where $\\eta$ is an isomorphism) and the later Wittgenstein's meaning-as-use (as the general case where $\\eta$ captures experiential alignment).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Philosophical Therapy (哲学治疗)\n\n### The Author's Account\n\nIn K1策略, the author provides a structural account of why philosophical therapy works, centered on the concept of 张力 (tension) --- the state where a sub-category lacks a well-defined universal property, so that experience cannot resolve into a stable terminal point:\n\n> \"这也是哲学治疗为什么有效的原因\"\n\nThe author connects this to the idea that philosophical puzzlement arises from structural tension --- multiple potential universal properties competing without resolution --- and that therapy works by restructuring the category so that the tension is resolved.\n\n### Wittgenstein's Therapeutic Conception\n\nFor Wittgenstein, philosophical problems arise from linguistic confusions: \"philosophical problems arise when language goes on holiday\" (PI section 38). Therapy consists in \"assembling reminders for a particular purpose\" (PI section 127) --- drawing attention to how words are actually used so that the confused philosopher can see that there was no genuine problem.\n\n### The Tension\n\nThe author's account **explains** why therapy works; Wittgenstein would regard such an explanation as itself a philosophical confusion. Wittgenstein explicitly rejects the idea that philosophy should produce theories (PI section 109: \"we may not advance any kind of theory\"). For Wittgenstein, the therapeutic effect is self-evident once the confusion is cleared; there is nothing further to explain.\n\nHowever, the author's account does something that Wittgenstein's does not: it provides a **positive criterion** for when philosophical puzzlement should arise and when it should be resolved. By identifying puzzlement with categorical tension, the author can (in principle) predict which conceptual configurations will produce confusion and which will not. This is a genuinely productive extension, even if it violates Wittgenstein's quietism.\n\nFurthermore, the author's framework offers an interesting **bridge** between Wittgenstein's therapeutic approach and more constructive philosophical programs. If therapy works by resolving categorical tension, then constructive philosophy (building new frameworks, new concepts) is *also* a form of therapy --- it resolves tension not by showing that the question was confused, but by providing new categorical structure in which the tension can be resolved. This is close to what the author describes as the construction of 境.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Rule-Following and 恒常 (Constancy)\n\n### The Author's Account of Stable Structures\n\nThe concept of 恒常 (constancy) is introduced in 后形而上学 整理 as the core of metaphysical thinking:\n\n> \"形而上的核心是恒常。我们需要在变化的现象之中寻找到（追求）一种恒常性\"\n\nIn K1策略, this is formalized as stable structures $S_E$ preserved under the evolution functor $T$. The idea is that certain structural features of experience are invariant under experiential evolution --- they are the \"rules\" that constrain how experience can develop.\n\n### Wittgenstein's Rule-Following\n\nWittgenstein's rule-following considerations (PI sections 138--242) constitute one of the most profound and difficult passages in 20th-century philosophy. The central problem is: what constitutes following a rule? Wittgenstein argues against any **mentalist** or **Platonist** account of rules. A rule is not a mental state that determines its applications, nor is it an abstract object that we grasp. Rather, rule-following is a *practice* --- it consists in the regularity of a community's behavior, and there is no deeper fact that makes the behavior count as following *this* rule rather than *that* one.\n\nThe Kripkenstein paradox (Kripke's reading of Wittgenstein) sharpens this: for any finite sequence of applications, there are infinitely many rules consistent with that sequence. What determines that we are following addition rather than \"quaddition\"?\n\n### Comparison\n\nThe author's formalization of constancy as functorial invariance is in tension with Wittgenstein's anti-formalism in several ways:\n\n1. **Formalization vs. practice**: The author treats rules as mathematical invariants ($S_E$ preserved under $T$); Wittgenstein insists that rules are constituted by practice, not by any formal structure.\n\n2. **Community vs. individual**: Wittgenstein's rule-following requires a community of practitioners; the author's framework is largely individualistic (analyzing the evolution of a single person's $\\mathbb{E}_t$).\n\n3. **Determinacy**: The author's $S_E$ is (in principle) mathematically determinate; Wittgenstein argues that there is no fact of the matter about which rule is being followed apart from practice.\n\nHowever, the author's framework also has **surprising resonances** with Wittgenstein:\n\n1. **No ground-level rules**: The author explicitly states that $S_E$ is descriptive, not constitutive. The stable structures are observed regularities, not prescriptive rules. This is actually close to Wittgenstein's point: the \"rule\" is what we observe in practice, not a Platonic entity.\n\n2. **Non-uniqueness**: The author acknowledges that different choices of sub-categories and different time-ranges will yield different $S_E$. This echoes Wittgenstein's point that rule-following is context-dependent and community-relative.\n\n3. **The role of agreement**: When the author discusses philosophical experiments and the possibility of evoking shared experiences across different people, the criterion of success is structural agreement --- \"只需要他们具有相同的结构性位置.\" This is remarkably close to Wittgenstein's emphasis on \"agreement in form of life\" (PI section 241) as the basis for following the same rule.\n\n**Assessment**: The author formalizes what Wittgenstein deliberately left un-formalized. Whether this is a productive move or a misunderstanding depends on one's reading of Wittgenstein. On a therapeutic reading, it is a confusion. On a constructive reading (closer to Brandom or McDowell), it is a legitimate extension that preserves the anti-Platonist and practice-oriented spirit while adding mathematical precision.\n\n---\n\n## 6. On Certainty and the Knowledge Essay\n\n### The Author's Argument\n\nIn \"A Thought on Knowledge,\" the author argues that knowledge reduces to belief by analyzing each component of the traditional justified true belief (JTB) definition:\n\n1. **Truth condition**: methodologically impossible --- we have access only to phenomena, never to truth directly.\n2. **Justification condition**: all justification ultimately rests on phenomena or beliefs; phenomena must be \"digested\" into beliefs to be used; therefore justification is ultimately belief about belief.\n3. **Conclusion**: knowledge is, in practice, \"what each individual believes to be correct.\"\n\n### Wittgenstein's On Certainty\n\n*On Certainty* (OC), written in the last months of Wittgenstein's life, addresses Moore's \"proof of the external world.\" Wittgenstein argues that certain propositions function not as items of knowledge but as **hinge propositions** --- they are the framework within which knowledge claims, doubts, and justifications operate. \"The questions that we raise and our doubts depend on the fact that some propositions are exempt from doubt, as it were like hinges on which those turn\" (OC section 341).\n\nKey features of hinge propositions:\n- They are not known in the traditional sense; they are the **conditions** for knowing (OC section 403).\n- They cannot be justified, but this does not make them arbitrary (OC section 559).\n- They belong to a \"system\" or \"world-picture\" (*Weltbild*) (OC section 162).\n- They can change over time as practices change (OC section 96).\n\n### Connection\n\nThe author's analysis and Wittgenstein's *On Certainty* arrive at strikingly similar conclusions through different routes:\n\n1. **Foundationalism fails**: The author shows that justification bottoms out in unjustified belief or circular justification. Wittgenstein shows that justification bottoms out in hinge propositions that are not themselves justified.\n\n2. **Practice over theory**: The author repeatedly emphasizes \"in practice\" (在实践中) --- what people actually do when they claim to know something. Wittgenstein similarly focuses on what Moore *actually does* when he says \"I know this is a hand.\"\n\n3. **Knowledge as communal standard**: The author proposes that knowledge is \"what most people in a field believe to be correct.\" Wittgenstein's world-picture is similarly communal and practice-embedded.\n\n4. **Historical contingency**: The author notes that knowledge \"changes over time (e.g., geocentrism).\" Wittgenstein explicitly allows that hinge propositions can shift (OC section 96--99).\n\nHowever, there is a significant difference. Wittgenstein would resist the reduction of knowledge to belief. For Wittgenstein, hinge propositions are **neither** known **nor** believed --- they are the framework within which the distinction between knowledge and belief operates. The author's move is more radical: dissolving the knowledge/belief distinction entirely. This is closer to **pragmatism** (James, Dewey, Rorty) than to Wittgenstein, who preserves the grammar of \"knowing\" and \"believing\" even as he transforms their philosophical significance.\n\nThe author's analysis of scientific knowledge through the lens of high-energy physics (where \"fundamental particles\" are never directly observed, only electromagnetic signals in detectors that are then reconstructed through models) is particularly compelling and parallels Wittgenstein's observation in OC section 105: \"All testing, all confirmation and disconfirmation of a hypothesis takes place already within a system.\"\n\n---\n\n## 7. Private Language and Intersubjectivity\n\n### The Author's Position\n\nAcross the essays, the author repeatedly argues that we cannot access others' inner states:\n\n> \"人类不仅永远无法真正知道其他人的真实想法\" (关于集体利益)\n\n> \"我无法真正感受到他人的内心感受\" (后形而上学 整理)\n\nYet the author proposes a criterion for communication and intersubjective verification:\n\n> \"我们不需要本体论的验证不同的人获得了'同一'体验（例如Qualia），只需要他们具有相同的结构性位置\" (K1策略)\n\n### Wittgenstein's Private Language Argument\n\nWittgenstein's private language argument (PI sections 243--315) argues that a language whose terms refer to the speaker's private sensations, knowable only to the speaker, is impossible. The key moves:\n\n1. A private linguist cannot establish a criterion of correctness for their sensation-terms (PI section 258).\n2. Without such a criterion, there is no distinction between following a rule and merely thinking one is following a rule (PI section 202).\n3. Therefore, the meaning of sensation-terms must be grounded in public, shared practices.\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe author's position is **deeply compatible** with the private language argument, perhaps more than the author realizes. Consider:\n\n1. **Structural position as public criterion**: The author's proposal that shared experience is verified by \"structural position\" rather than by qualitative identity is exactly the kind of **public criterion** that Wittgenstein argues sensation-terms must have. We don't need to verify that your red *feels* the same as my red; we need only verify that \"red\" occupies the same structural position in both our linguistic/experiential networks.\n\n2. **Rejection of private access**: The author's insistence that we cannot know others' inner states, combined with the claim that structural verification suffices for communication, mirrors Wittgenstein's point that the \"private object\" drops out as irrelevant to meaning (PI section 293, the \"beetle in the box\" passage).\n\n3. **Category-theoretic formalization**: The author's framework provides a precise mathematical formulation of what \"same structural position\" means: isomorphic placement within a categorical structure. This goes beyond what Wittgenstein offers but is entirely consistent with his philosophical conclusions.\n\nWhere the author diverges from Wittgenstein is in maintaining that there genuinely *are* inner states that we cannot access --- the framework preserves subjective experience as ontologically real even if epistemically inaccessible. Wittgenstein, by contrast, argues that the very picture of \"inner states\" that others cannot access is confused: \"The essential thing about private experience is really not that each person possesses his own exemplar, but that nobody knows whether other people also have this or something else\" (PI section 272). For Wittgenstein, this \"not knowing\" is not an epistemic limitation but a grammatical observation --- the concept of \"knowing another's sensation\" has no clear application.\n\n**Assessment**: The author's structural verification criterion is one of the most philosophically productive ideas in the collection, and it can be read as a **constructive implementation** of Wittgenstein's insight that meaning is public. The category-theoretic apparatus provides precisely the tools needed to make \"same structural position\" rigorous. For the full account of how the natural transformation $\\eta$ serves as the mechanism of intersubjective verification --- and how the naturality condition itself functions as the public criterion, giving mathematical content to the beetle-in-the-box insight --- see Supplementary Section S1 below.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Forms of Life and 境/梦境\n\n### Wittgenstein's Forms of Life (Lebensformen)\n\n\"Forms of life\" is one of the most evocative and under-determined concepts in Wittgenstein. It appears only a handful of times in the *Investigations* (PI sections 19, 23, 241; PI p. 226). Its precise meaning is debated, but the central idea is that language games are embedded in broader patterns of human activity, behavior, and agreement. \"To imagine a language means to imagine a form of life\" (PI section 19).\n\nForms of life are:\n- **Not reducible to rules or structures**: they include the \"weave of life\" --- behaviors, reactions, training, natural history.\n- **The given**: \"What has to be accepted, the given, is --- so one could say --- forms of life\" (PI p. 226).\n- **Neither subjective nor objective**: they are the shared background against which subjectivity and objectivity make sense.\n\n### The Author's 境 and 梦境\n\nThe author's 境 ($\\mathbb{E}$) is defined as a categorical structure on phenomena ($\\mathfrak{P}$): experiences as objects, associations (联想) as morphisms, forming a tower structure. 梦境 is the \"environment\" in which meaning becomes possible --- the \"packaging\" of experience within which purposes and significance arise.\n\n### Comparison\n\nThere are genuine parallels:\n\n1. **Background for meaning**: Both forms of life and 境 serve as the background against which meaning, understanding, and purpose operate. Neither is itself an object of direct scrutiny --- both are the medium *in which* we think and act.\n\n2. **Given-ness**: The author's insistence that we cannot escape all 境 (\"抛弃所有的梦境即是不可能的\") parallels Wittgenstein's claim that forms of life are \"the given.\"\n\n3. **Multiplicity**: The author allows for multiple sub-categories ($\\mathcal{E}_L$, $\\mathcal{E}_M$, $\\mathcal{E}_K$) within $\\mathbb{E}$; Wittgenstein allows for multiple, overlapping forms of life.\n\nHowever, the differences are also significant:\n\n1. **Formalization**: 境 is explicitly formalized using category theory; Wittgenstein's forms of life are deliberately left informal. Wittgenstein would likely regard the formalization as a category mistake --- forms of life are not the kind of thing that *can* be formalized, because they include precisely those aspects of human activity that resist formalization.\n\n2. **Individualism vs. communalism**: 境 is fundamentally individual (each person has their own $\\mathbb{E}_t$); forms of life are fundamentally communal (they are shared patterns of activity). This is a deep philosophical difference. The author addresses intersubjectivity through structural correspondence, but the starting point is the individual subject.\n\n3. **Static vs. dynamic**: The author's 境 evolves ($T_t: \\mathbb{E}_t \\to \\mathbb{E}_{t+1}$); Wittgenstein's forms of life are relatively stable (they change historically but are not theorized as evolving).\n\n4. **Dreamscape metaphor**: 梦境 (dreamscape) --- particularly the distinction between 沉醉 (immersed/intoxicated) and 清醒 (lucid/awake) --- introduces an element of **self-awareness** that has no direct parallel in Wittgenstein. The idea of a \"lucid dream\" where one is fully invested yet fully aware of the constructed nature of the meaning-structure goes beyond Wittgenstein's framework. This is more reminiscent of Heidegger's distinction between authentic and inauthentic existence, or of the Buddhist concept of mindfulness within samsara.\n\n**Assessment**: 境 is best understood not as a formalization of Wittgenstein's forms of life, but as a **parallel concept** developed from different philosophical motivations. Forms of life are the communal background of meaning; 境 is the individual structural medium of experience. The two concepts address overlapping philosophical territory but from different starting points and with different emphases.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Translation Challenges\n\n### Key Terms with Wittgensteinian Resonance\n\nThe following terms require careful handling in translation due to their proximity to --- but divergence from --- established Wittgensteinian terminology:\n\n**语言游戏 (language games)**: The standard translation of Wittgenstein's *Sprachspiele* is \"language games.\" The author uses the same Chinese term but with a different emphasis: as a methodological tool for discovering stable structures rather than as the bedrock of meaning. Translators should use \"language games\" but add a note distinguishing the author's usage from Wittgenstein's. Consider: \"language games (in the methodological sense)\" on first occurrence, then simply \"language games\" thereafter.\n\n**哲学治疗 (philosophical therapy)**: This translates straightforwardly as \"philosophical therapy,\" which is the standard rendering of Wittgenstein's concept. But since the author gives it a structural explanation (resolution of categorical tension), a translator's note should clarify the difference.\n\n**结构 (structure)** and **意义 (meaning)**: These are the central terms in the structure/meaning question. \"Structure\" and \"meaning\" are straightforward, but the translator should be aware that the author's use of \"meaning\" is experiential/phenomenological rather than truth-conditional or referential.\n\n**理解 (understanding) vs. 掌握 (mastery/grasp)**: This distinction is philosophically crucial. The author defines 掌握 as the special case where $\\eta_a$ is the identity --- a \"direct confirmation sense\" without mediation. This corresponds to what Wittgenstein calls \"understanding\" in its most robust sense. I recommend translating 理解 as \"understanding\" and 掌握 as \"mastery\" or \"direct grasp,\" with a note explaining that the latter is a technical term in the author's framework corresponding to the identity natural transformation.\n\n**恒常 (constancy)**: This is the author's term for the invariance at the heart of metaphysics. \"Constancy\" is adequate but risks confusion with Husserl's \"constancy\" (*Bestandigkeit*). \"Invariance\" captures the mathematical sense better, but \"constancy\" preserves the more phenomenological register. I recommend \"constancy\" with a parenthetical \"(invariance)\" on first occurrence.\n\n**境**: See the full dictionary entry below. This is the most challenging term.\n\n**规则 (rules)**: Standard translation. But note that the author's \"rules\" are stable structures ($S_E$), not Wittgensteinian rule-following practices.\n\n### Critical Translation Implication: Experiential Sequence is Load-Bearing\n\nThe recognition that many passages in these essays function as **philosophical experiments** (see Supplementary Section S2 below) has a major implication for translation: **the experiential sequence of examples is load-bearing, not merely illustrative**. Translators must preserve the precise ordering, pacing, and experiential progression of the author's examples, because these sequences are designed to construct specific experiential structures in the reader.\n\nConcretely:\n\n1. **The Sisyphus -> office worker -> entrepreneur -> cat sequence** in 西西弗斯、班与猫 is a carefully staged dissolution. Each example builds on the previous one by modifying a single variable. Reordering, condensing, or abstracting this sequence would destroy the experiment --- the reader would not undergo the intended experiential progression from \"absurdity is inherent in repetition\" to \"absurdity is absent in intrinsically motivated repetition.\"\n\n2. **The 道德仁义礼 reversal** in 后形而上学 整理 requires the reader to first hold the traditional top-down ordering, then step-by-step experience its inversion. If a translator were to summarize this as \"the author argues that the traditional ordering is inverted,\" the philosophical experiment would be lost --- the reader would receive a proposition rather than undergoing an experiential restructuring.\n\n3. **The \"1+1=2\" and meme-sentence examples** in K1策略 require the reader to introspect in real time: first experiencing understanding (the $\\eta$ of \"1+1=2\"), then experiencing the *failure* of understanding (the meme sentence). Paraphrasing or footnoting these away would remove the experimental core.\n\n4. **The Ship of Theseus and \"what is a person?\" examples** in 范畴论与境 整理 are designed to evoke the universal property as a *felt experience*. The reader is supposed to notice the feeling itself, not just understand the proposition about it.\n\nThis means translators should treat these passages with the same care a literary translator gives to the pacing of a novel or the line breaks of a poem. The sequences are not decorative illustrations of abstract points; they are the philosophical argument itself, conducted in the register of experience. From a Wittgensteinian perspective, this is exactly right: for Wittgenstein, the examples *are* the philosophy (PI section 133), and any attempt to extract \"the point\" from the examples and present it abstractly is already a distortion.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Overall Significance\n\n### Does the Framework Achieve Something Wittgenstein Attempted?\n\nThe relationship between this framework and Wittgenstein's philosophy is best characterized as **complementary rather than duplicative**. Wittgenstein sought to dissolve philosophical problems by showing that they arise from linguistic confusions. The author seeks to **describe the structure of experience** in a way that makes philosophical problems tractable --- either dissolvable (by showing that they arise from categorical tension) or answerable (by mapping experiential structures through formal tools).\n\nThe deepest convergence is in the **anti-foundationalist** character of both projects:\n- Wittgenstein: there is no foundation beneath language games and forms of life; they are the given.\n- The author: there is no 第〇实在 (zeroth reality) accessible to us; phenomena are the 第一实在 (first reality), and all metaphysics is constructed *upon* phenomena.\n\nThe deepest divergence is in their attitudes toward **formalization**:\n- Wittgenstein: formalization is part of the disease, not the cure. Philosophical problems arise precisely from our attempt to force the richness of language use into formal molds.\n- The author: formalization (specifically, category theory) is a useful tool that, properly wielded, can illuminate the structure of experience without claiming to capture its essence.\n\n### Is the Category-Theoretic Formalization Productive?\n\nI believe it is, for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Natural transformations capture something real about understanding**. The idea that understanding is the alignment between structural evolution and experiential evolution, formalized as a natural transformation, is a genuinely illuminating philosophical proposal. It gives mathematical content to the vague notion of \"grasping\" meaning, and it does so in a way that is consistent with Wittgensteinian insights about the primacy of use and practice.\n\n2. **The structural verification criterion resolves a genuine problem**. Wittgenstein's private language argument establishes that meaning must be public, but it does not provide a positive account of *how* public meaning works. The author's structural position criterion fills this gap.\n\n3. **The framework is self-limiting**. The author repeatedly insists on the descriptive (rather than constitutive) character of the framework, and on the tool-like status of category theory. This self-limitation prevents the framework from falling into the kind of metaphysical dogmatism that Wittgenstein criticizes.\n\n4. **Connection to empirical verification**. The proposal for \"philosophical experiments\" --- constructing experiences with specific structural properties and verifying that they evoke the predicted experiential responses --- is a genuinely novel contribution to philosophical methodology. This goes beyond what Wittgenstein, the formal semanticists, or the speech act theorists have proposed.\n\nHowever, a Wittgensteinian critic would rightly note:\n- The framework may create new philosophical confusions even as it resolves old ones (e.g., reifying \"stable structures\" in experience).\n- The mathematical apparatus may obscure rather than illuminate for readers not trained in category theory.\n- The individualist starting point may miss the essentially communal character of meaning that Wittgenstein emphasizes.\n\n### Positioning in the Field\n\nWithin contemporary philosophy of language, this framework occupies a distinctive position:\n- It shares **inferentialism's** (Brandom) emphasis on structural relations over reference, but replaces inferential roles with categorical structures.\n- It shares **dynamic semantics'** emphasis on meaning as process, but operates at a more fundamental level (experience rather than discourse).\n- It shares **phenomenology's** (Husserl, Heidegger) emphasis on lived experience, but provides mathematical tools for structural analysis.\n- It inherits **Wittgenstein's** anti-foundationalism and emphasis on practice, but converts therapeutic insights into constructive resources.\n\nThe result is something genuinely new: a **structural phenomenology of meaning** that uses category theory as its formal backbone. Whether this will prove philosophically fruitful in the long run depends on whether the framework can generate specific, testable insights about the structure of understanding --- and the author's proposal for philosophical experiments suggests a path toward doing exactly that.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix: Notes on Individual Essays\n\n### 关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一\nFrom a philosophy of language perspective, the most interesting move here is the analogy between macro-level concepts (collective interest) and the renormalization group in physics. This parallels Wittgenstein's observation that concepts can operate at different \"levels\" without reducing to their micro-level constituents (cf. PI section 71 on family resemblance). The author's claim that \"人类不仅永远无法真正知道其他人的真实想法\" anticipates the private language considerations developed more fully in later essays.\n\n### A Thought on Knowledge\nThis essay is the most directly relevant to analytic epistemology and to *On Certainty*. The systematic stripping away of JTB components is clear and effective. The approach of focusing on \"how we access\" justification bases rather than \"what they are\" is thoroughly Wittgensteinian in spirit.\n\n### 西西弗斯、班与猫\nThe dissolution of absurdism through the concept of internally generated meaning (养猫) is philosophically elegant. From a Wittgensteinian perspective, the key insight is that meaning does not require articulation or justification --- the cat-owner does not need to state *why* cat care is meaningful. This resonates with Wittgenstein's observation that forms of life do not require external justification; they are the given.\n\n### 后形而上学 整理\nThe layered analysis of metaphysics (Types 0-3) and the \"inversion\" of 道德仁义礼 is sophisticated. The concept of 恒常 as the core of metaphysical thinking is a genuine contribution. The distinction between 第一实在 (phenomena) and 第二实在 (constructed reality) maps partially onto Wittgenstein's distinction between what is given and what is constructed in language, though the author's framework is more explicitly ontological.\n\n### 形而上学后的目的：诗意\nThe distinction between 沉醉 (immersed) and 清醒 (lucid) dreamscapes is philosophically original. It offers a way of being meaning-engaged that is neither naive (pre-critical) nor nihilistic (post-critical). This has no direct Wittgensteinian parallel but is consistent with the later Wittgenstein's acceptance of forms of life as \"the given.\"\n\n### 范畴论与境 整理\nThis is where the formal apparatus is developed. The identification of associations (联想) with morphisms, and the tower structure of experience, are the framework's most technically innovative features. The examples (Ship of Theseus, \"what is a person?\", dragon's blood) effectively illustrate how the formal tools apply to traditional philosophical problems.\n\n### 范畴论与境：K1策略\nThis is the framework's culminating essay. The natural transformation analysis of understanding, the structural verification criterion, and the proposal for philosophical experiments are the most philosophically significant contributions. The explicit engagement with language games and philosophical therapy shows the author's awareness of the Wittgensteinian tradition.\n\n### 关于诗意和境的一些零散想法\nThis collection of notes extends and applies the framework. The self-referential observation that we are already constructing 境 in everyday life --- choosing clothes, decorating rooms, taking photographs --- grounds the abstract framework in lived practice, which is the most Wittgensteinian gesture in the entire collection.\n\n---\n\n## Supplementary Analysis: Two Follow-Up Topics\n\n### S1. Intersubjectivity via the Natural Transformation $\\eta$\n\nThe author suggests that the natural transformation $\\eta$ is the mechanism through which intersubjective verification is possible. Let me trace how this works and assess it from a Wittgensteinian perspective.\n\n#### The Mechanism\n\nConsider two people, Alice and Bob, both reading the sentence \"The cat jumped on the table\" (猫跳上了桌子). In K1策略, understanding this sentence requires a natural transformation between the sentence's structural evolution (its syntactic unfolding) and one's experiential evolution (the mental simulation of the event). If Alice has an $\\eta^A$ and Bob has an $\\eta^B$, the question of intersubjectivity becomes: do Alice and Bob understand the same thing?\n\nThe author's answer (K1策略 methodology point 3) is that we do not need ontological verification that $\\eta^A$ and $\\eta^B$ are qualitatively identical --- we need only that they occupy the same **structural position**. That is, if Alice's $\\eta^A$ relates the same objects and morphisms in the same way as Bob's $\\eta^B$, then their understanding is commensurable.\n\nMore precisely: the naturality condition requires that $\\eta$ commutes with all morphisms in the source category. This means $\\eta$ is not a free-floating subjective response but a **structurally constrained** response. Two people whose $\\eta$'s satisfy the same naturality diagrams are, in a rigorous mathematical sense, aligned --- even if the \"felt quality\" of their $\\eta$'s differs. The commutative diagram itself is the public, shareable criterion of understanding.\n\n#### Wittgensteinian Assessment\n\nThis is, I believe, the most philosophically significant move in the entire collection, and it represents a **genuine advance** on the intersubjectivity problem that goes beyond what Wittgenstein himself achieved. Here is why.\n\nWittgenstein's treatment of intersubjectivity operates on two levels:\n\n1. **The Private Language Argument (PI sections 243--315)**: Meaning must be public. The \"beetle in the box\" thought experiment (PI section 293) shows that if everyone has a box with something in it that only they can see, the \"something\" drops out of the language game --- what matters is the *role* of \"beetle\" in our shared practice, not its private content.\n\n2. **Agreement in Form of Life (PI section 241)**: \"So you are saying that human agreement decides what is true and what is false?\" --- \"It is what human beings *say* that is true and false; and they agree in the *language* they use. That is not agreement in opinions but in form of life.\"\n\nWittgenstein establishes that meaning is public and that intersubjective agreement is grounded in shared form of life. But he does not provide a **mechanism** for how this works. He would resist providing one, on therapeutic grounds --- the question \"how does intersubjective understanding work?\" is, for the quietist, already a confused question (understanding is not a process; cf. PI section 154).\n\nThe author's natural transformation framework provides what Wittgenstein deliberately withholds: a **positive structural account** of intersubjective alignment. The key insight is that **the naturality condition is itself the public criterion**. Consider:\n\n- The naturality square for $\\eta$ is a mathematical structure that can be checked, tested, and communicated.\n- Two people who both satisfy the naturality condition for the same source category are provably aligned in their structural responses.\n- This alignment does not require access to anyone's private experience --- it requires only that both people's responses are coherent with the same categorical structure.\n\nThis is precisely analogous to Wittgenstein's beetle-in-the-box: the private content ($\\eta^A$ vs $\\eta^B$ as felt experiences) drops out; what remains is the structural role ($\\eta$ as a natural transformation satisfying commutative diagrams). The author has given **mathematical content** to the beetle-in-the-box insight.\n\nFurthermore, the naturality condition addresses the **Kripkenstein problem** (Kripke's skeptical reading of Wittgenstein on rule-following). Kripke asks: what fact about me determines that I mean addition rather than \"quaddition\" by \"+\"? The author's framework suggests an answer: the fact that my $\\eta$ satisfies the naturality condition for the categorical structure of arithmetic. If my $\\eta$ is natural (commutes with all morphisms), then my understanding is structurally determined --- there is no room for quaddition-like deviance, because the naturality condition constrains $\\eta$ globally, not just at finitely many points. This is not Kripke's \"skeptical solution\" (meaning as community agreement) but something closer to a **structural solution**: meaning is fixed by the naturality constraint itself.\n\nHowever, a Wittgensteinian would raise the following concern: **who verifies the naturality condition?** If Alice checks whether Bob's $\\eta$ commutes with all morphisms, she must access Bob's $\\eta$ --- which is, by hypothesis, an experience in Bob's $\\mathbb{E}$. The author's response would presumably be the philosophical experiment methodology: construct situations designed to test whether specific components of $\\eta$ are present, and check for replicable behavioral responses. This converts the naturality check into an empirical procedure, which is consistent with Wittgenstein's emphasis on practice. But it also shows that **intersubjective verification is always partial and practical** --- we can check finitely many components of $\\eta$ through experiments, but we can never verify the full naturality condition. This partial, practical character is, I think, exactly right, and it is exactly what Wittgenstein would predict: agreement is always agreement in what we *do*, not in some metaphysical fact about shared understanding.\n\n**Key conclusion**: The natural transformation $\\eta$ provides a **structural criterion for intersubjective commensurability** that is (1) consistent with the private language argument's conclusion that meaning is public, (2) more specific than Wittgenstein's appeal to \"agreement in form of life,\" and (3) potentially testable through the philosophical experiment methodology. This is a genuine contribution to philosophy of language.\n\n#### Translation Note (Addendum to Dictionary)\n\nThe term 主体间性 should be translated as **intersubjectivity**. In the author's framework, intersubjectivity is not grounded in empathy, shared consciousness, or transcendental structures, but in **structural commensurability** --- the sharing of naturality conditions. This is distinct from Husserl's intersubjectivity (grounded in empathic appresentation), Habermas's (grounded in communicative rationality), and Wittgenstein's (grounded in agreement in form of life). The author's is perhaps closest to Brandom's inferentialism, where intersubjectivity is constituted by the mutual recognition of inferential commitments.\n\n---\n\n### S2. The Essays as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThe author proposes that \"philosophical experiments\" consist in constructing examples with specific structures to awaken specific experiences in readers, then checking whether those experiences are replicable (K1策略, methodology point 3). The author further suggests in \"写在最后\" that this practice is already ubiquitous: poetry, literature, art, music, games, memes, and even decorating one's room are all instances of constructing 境 to awaken experience.\n\nRe-reading the essays with this lens reveals that **several passages are indeed functioning as philosophical experiments** --- they are not merely *describing* philosophical positions but are actively *constructing* experiential structures in the reader. Let me identify the most significant instances.\n\n#### Experiment 1: The Sisyphus/Cat Essay as Dissolution of Absurdity\n\nThe essay 西西弗斯、班与猫 has a very specific argumentative structure that functions as a philosophical experiment:\n\n1. **Setup (establishing the target experience)**: The reader is invited to feel the absurdity of Sisyphus's situation, and then the absurdity of the office worker's situation. These are familiar scenarios; most readers will have a pre-existing $\\eta$ that connects \"repetitive labor\" with \"absurdity.\"\n\n2. **Pivot (disrupting the structural alignment)**: The author introduces the entrepreneur --- structurally identical labor, but no absurdity. This forces the reader to notice that their $\\eta$ between \"repetition\" and \"absurdity\" was not intrinsic but contingent on **alienation** (the meaning being external).\n\n3. **Dissolution (constructing a new $\\eta$)**: The cat example. Here the author constructs a scenario that is structurally identical to Sisyphus (repetitive, effortful, no cosmic purpose) but where the experience of absurdity is simply **absent**. The rhetorical force of this example depends on the reader *actually experiencing* the absence of absurdity when thinking about cat care. The sentence \"没有一个养猫的人会感到荒谬，荒谬从未来过\" is designed to trigger the reader's introspective verification: *Is this true? Do I feel absurdity when I think about caring for a cat?* The expected answer is no, and this no is itself the philosophical experiment's result.\n\nFrom a Wittgensteinian perspective, this is a paradigmatic example of **philosophical therapy conducted through examples** --- exactly what Wittgenstein does in the *Investigations*. Consider PI section 66, where Wittgenstein asks the reader to \"look and see\" whether there is something common to all games. The rhetorical structure is identical: Wittgenstein constructs a series of examples, invites the reader to introspect, and expects a specific experiential result (the *absence* of a common feature). The cat example works the same way: the author constructs a scenario, invites introspection, and expects the *absence* of absurdity.\n\nWhat makes this a philosophical *experiment* rather than merely a philosophical *argument* is that **the reader's introspective response is the evidence**. If the reader *does* feel absurdity when thinking about cat care, the experiment has failed for that reader, and the philosophical claim is not established. The claim is empirical-experiential, not logically necessary.\n\nThis is genuinely Wittgensteinian in method, even if the author's framework provides a more structural account of *why* the method works (the examples construct specific categorical structures that do or do not support a natural transformation involving \"absurdity\").\n\n#### Experiment 2: The 道德仁义礼 Reversal as Restructuring of the Reader's 境\n\nThe 道德仁义礼 passage in 后形而上学 整理 functions as a different kind of philosophical experiment --- one aimed at **restructuring** the reader's 境 rather than dissolving a specific feeling.\n\nThe passage proceeds in several steps:\n\n1. **The traditional ordering is presented**: 道 -> 德 -> 仁 -> 义 -> 礼. This is the familiar top-down metaphysical picture. Most readers educated in Chinese philosophy will have an existing $\\eta$ aligning this ordering with their understanding of the concepts.\n\n2. **The author introduces \"现象礼\"**: The reader is asked to recall the actual *experience* of ritual behavior --- how it feels, from the inside, to behave ritually toward others. This is a request for introspection.\n\n3. **The reversal is performed step by step**: 现象礼 -> 现象义 -> 现象仁 -> 德 -> 道. Each step is justified by appeal to the reader's own experience: \"this feeling is what you actually experience\" (切实感受到的). The reader is being guided through a reconstruction of their own experiential categories.\n\n4. **The inversion is made explicit**: \"整个逻辑的顺序就被倒反过来.\" The reader is invited to experience the *shift* --- the moment when the traditional ordering \"flips\" and the reader sees that what they took to be foundational (道) was actually derived (from 现象礼).\n\nFrom a Wittgensteinian perspective, this is a **perspicuous presentation** (*ubersichtliche Darstellung*, PI section 122) --- a rearrangement of what was already known that produces a new way of seeing. Wittgenstein's own method in the *Investigations* is precisely this: he does not introduce new facts but rearranges familiar facts so that we see them differently. The duck-rabbit (PI p. 194) is the iconic example: the same figure, seen differently.\n\nBut the 道德仁义礼 passage is more than a static perspicuous presentation --- it is a **guided restructuring** of the reader's experiential categories. The reader's $\\mathcal{E}$ is being actively reorganized: the meta-order of 道, 德, 仁, 义, 礼 is being inverted. If the experiment succeeds, the reader emerges with a different categorical structure --- one where phenomena are foundational and metaphysical concepts are derived. This is a restructuring of the reader's 境 itself.\n\nThis is something Wittgenstein does implicitly but never theorizes. The author, by providing the category-theoretic framework, can now describe *what happens* when a philosophical example restructures one's understanding: it changes the meta-ordering of objects in $\\mathcal{E}$, potentially changing which objects serve as universal properties, and thereby changing the reader's metaphysical commitments.\n\n#### Experiment 3: The \"1+1=2\" Passage as Evoking $\\eta$\n\nIn K1策略, the passage where the author asks the reader to introspect on the experience of understanding \"1+1=2\" is itself a philosophical experiment. The reader is asked:\n\n- Do you experience a \"direct confirmation sense\" when you see \"1+1=2\"?\n- Is this different from the experience of checking your answer against a reference?\n- Can you recognize the experience of $\\eta$ as identity (掌握) versus $\\eta$ as non-trivial (理解 without 掌握)?\n\nThe passage about the meme sentence \"你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国，记住我给出的原理\" is particularly effective: the reader is asked to notice the *failure* of $\\eta$ --- the experience of **not understanding** despite grammatical correctness. This negative result (the absence of alignment) is just as experimentally significant as the positive case.\n\n#### Experiment 4: The 忒修斯之船 (Ship of Theseus) as Evoking the Universal Property\n\nIn 范畴论与境 整理, the Ship of Theseus discussion asks the reader to introspect: \"When you think of the Ship of Theseus, what do you experience?\" The expected answer is a specific *feeling* --- the feeling that accompanies the concept of this particular ship, which is the universal property of the sub-category $\\mathcal{E}_{\\text{Theseus}}$. The author then shows that choosing $\\mathfrak{P}$ as the physical world leads to the paradox (the universal property becomes \"emptiness\"), while choosing $\\mathfrak{P}$ as phenomena resolves it (the universal property is the *feeling* of \"this ship\"). The reader is invited to verify this through introspection: \"Is the identity of the Ship of Theseus located in the physical planks or in my experience of the ship?\"\n\n#### Wittgensteinian Assessment of the Experimental Method\n\nWittgenstein would have a complex reaction to the philosophical experiment methodology:\n\n**What he would endorse**: The centrality of concrete examples, the appeal to introspective verification, the refusal to argue from abstract principles alone. These are all Wittgensteinian virtues. PI section 593: \"A main cause of philosophical disease --- a one-sided diet: one nourishes one's thinking with only one kind of example.\"\n\n**What he would resist**: The idea that introspective responses can be treated as *data* for a structural theory. For Wittgenstein, the examples are **self-sufficient** --- they do not serve a higher theoretical purpose. They are not evidence for a theory about natural transformations; they are the thing itself. The moment you treat introspective responses as data points in a structural theory, you have, from Wittgenstein's perspective, taken a step away from the phenomena and toward a philosophical construction.\n\n**What is genuinely new**: The author's key innovation is the claim that philosophical experiments can be designed *in advance* by specifying the categorical structure that should evoke the target experience. This is the reverse of Wittgenstein's method: Wittgenstein finds examples that dissolve existing confusions; the author proposes to *construct* examples that produce *specific predicted* experiences. This is a move from therapeutic philosophy to what we might call **constructive experimental phenomenology**. It has no precedent in Wittgenstein, though it has affinities with Austin's method of constructing specific speech-act scenarios to test linguistic intuitions. (Austin also believed that carefully constructed examples could serve as evidence for philosophical claims about language.)\n\n**The deepest insight**: The author's observation that the essays *themselves* are philosophical experiments --- not just descriptions of a theory but active interventions in the reader's experiential structure --- collapses the distinction between philosophical writing and philosophical practice. This is actually the most Wittgensteinian thing in the entire collection, because it embodies Wittgenstein's claim that philosophy is an *activity* (Tractatus 4.112), not a body of doctrine. The essays do not merely *say* that meaning is experiential alignment; they *show* it by constructing experiences in the reader. The medium is the message. This is philosophy as performance, as practice --- which is, in the end, what Wittgenstein always insisted philosophy should be.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":356,"oldLines":7,"newStart":356,"newLines":7,"lines":[" This essay is the most directly relevant to analytic epistemology and to *On Certainty*.

Language Games in the Framework\n\n### The Author's Usage of 语言游戏 (Language Games)\n\nIn K1策略, the author explicitly invokes the concept of 语言游戏 (language games) as a method for investigating stable structures ($S_L$) within the linguistic sub-category $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$. The key passage states:\n\n> \"于是我们就可以通过语言游戏研究语言演化中的稳定结构 $S_L$，来间接获得对 $\\mathbb{E}_t$ 中 $S_E$ 的认识\"\n\nThis usage represents a **productive but significantly reoriented extension** of Wittgenstein's concept. In the *Philosophical Investigations*, language games serve multiple functions: they are simplified models of language use (PI section 2), they illustrate the multiplicity and heterogeneity of linguistic practices (PI section 23), and they are bound up with \"forms of life\" (PI section 23). Crucially, for Wittgenstein, language games are **not instruments for discovering underlying structures**. They are the thing itself --- the level at which meaning operates. There is no deeper structure that language games reveal; rather, language games *are* the bedrock.\n\nThe author, by contrast, treats language games as **probes** --- methodological instruments that, through the functor $(F_{E,L})_t$, can map linguistic stable structures onto experiential stable structures. This is closer to what we might call a **constructive-structuralist** appropriation of language games. Wittgenstein would likely resist this move, since for him the idea that language games reveal hidden invariants would itself be a philosophical confusion --- the very kind of theorizing he sought to dissolve.\n\nHowever, the author's framework is more subtle than a naive structuralism. The author acknowledges that the mapping $(F_{E,L})_t(S_L) \\approx S_E$ is only approximate, that it captures at best a partial overlap, and that the relationship is descriptive rather than constitutive. This qualification brings the author somewhat closer to Wittgenstein's therapeutic spirit: the framework does not claim to have found the *essence* of meaning, but rather offers a tool for mapping certain structural relationships.\n\n### Therapeutic vs. Constructive Conceptions\n\nWittgenstein's conception of philosophy is famously therapeutic: \"The philosopher treats a question; like an illness\" (PI section 255). The aim is not to construct theories but to dissolve confusions by achieving a \"perspicuous presentation\" (*ubersichtliche Darstellung*, PI section 122). PI section 133 states: \"The real discovery is the one that enables me to break off doing philosophy when I want to.\"\n\nThe author explicitly mentions 哲学治疗 (philosophical therapy) in K1策略 and claims that the framework explains why it works --- roughly, through the resolution of \"tension\" (张力) when experiential sub-categories lack a well-defined universal property. This is a **structural explanation of why therapy works**, which is itself a constructive philosophical move. Wittgenstein would not attempt to explain *why* therapy works in structural-mathematical terms; for him, the therapy works by showing us the way out of the fly-bottle (PI section 309), not by constructing a formal account of fly-bottles.\n\n**Assessment**: The author's use of language games is a **departure** from Wittgenstein's anti-theoretical stance, but it is a **self-aware departure**. The author does not claim to be doing what Wittgenstein did; rather, the author uses Wittgenstein's concept as one input among many in a constructive framework. This is closer to how Robert Brandom appropriates Wittgenstein --- taking the insight about the primacy of practice and embedding it within a systematic philosophical project --- than to the quietist reading of Wittgenstein associated with Cora Diamond and James Conant.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Meaning and Structure: 是结构先于意义，还是意义先于结构？\n\n### The Author's Resolution via Natural Transformations\n\nIn K1策略, the author asks: does structure precede meaning, or meaning precede structure? The resolution is given through the natural transformation framework:\n\n> \"结构和意义之间的关系是自然变换：一句话能够被理解，他必须能够在心理过程的演化和结构的演化中达成如上所述的这种一致性感受$\\eta$\"\n\nThis is a striking move. The author refuses the dichotomy by arguing that structure and meaning are related by a **natural transformation** --- neither generates the other, but they must be **aligned**. Understanding ($\\eta$) is precisely the experience of this alignment.\n\n### Relation to Wittgenstein's Meaning-as-Use\n\nWittgenstein's meaning-as-use thesis (PI section 43: \"the meaning of a word is its use in the language\") dissolves the structure/meaning dichotomy from a different direction. For Wittgenstein, there is no pre-linguistic meaning that structure then encodes, nor is there a pure structure that then generates meaning. Meaning simply *is* the pattern of use within a language game embedded in a form of life.\n\nThe author's framework can be read as a **formalization of why Wittgenstein's dissolution works**. If structure and meaning are related by natural transformation rather than by generation, then asking which comes first is indeed a confused question --- just as Wittgenstein suggests. The natural transformation framework gives mathematical content to the Wittgensteinian insight that meaning and use are co-constitutive.\n\nHowever, there is a crucial difference. For Wittgenstein, meaning-as-use is meant to *stop* philosophical theorizing about meaning. The point is that once we see that meaning is use, there is nothing further to explain. The author, by contrast, uses the dissolution of the dichotomy as a *starting point* for further structural analysis. This is characteristic of the author's general approach: taking Wittgensteinian therapeutic insights and converting them into constructive theoretical resources.\n\n### Contrast with Formal Semantics\n\nIn truth-conditional formal semantics (Montague, Davidson, Tarski), meaning is identified with truth-conditions, and structure (syntactic/logical form) determines meaning via compositional rules. This is a clear \"structure precedes meaning\" position. The author's framework differs from this in several ways:\n\n1. **No appeal to truth**: The author's framework, consistent with the Knowledge essay, does not invoke truth-conditions. Meaning is experiential alignment ($\\eta$), not truth-value assignment.\n2. **Bidirectionality**: Formal semantics maps structure to meaning; the author's natural transformation allows influence in both directions.\n3. **Dynamic character**: Formal semantics is typically static (a sentence has its meaning at a time); the author's framework is inherently evolutionary ($t \\to t+1$).\n\nThe author's position has more in common with **dynamic semantics** (Kamp, Heim, Groenendijk & Stokhof) and with **inferentialist semantics** (Brandom), where meaning is constituted by inferential role and responsive to context, than with classical Montague grammar.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The Picture Theory and Natural Transformations\n\n### Tractatus Picture Theory\n\nThe early Wittgenstein's picture theory (Tractatus 2.1--2.225) posits that propositions are pictures of reality. A picture shares \"logical form\" with what it depicts (T 2.18). The picture \"reaches up to reality\" (T 2.1511) through a structural isomorphism between the elements of the picture and the elements of the state of affairs.\n\n### The Author's Natural Transformation Framework\n\nThe author's framework posits that understanding occurs when the evolution of a formal structure (e.g., mathematics, language) and the evolution of experience are related by a natural transformation. The $\\eta_a$ component measures the alignment between two paths from structure to experience.\n\n### Comparison\n\nThere is a **genuine structural parallel**. Both frameworks posit that the relationship between language/formalism and reality/experience is mediated by **structural correspondence**. However, the differences are substantial:\n\n| Feature | Tractatus Picture Theory | Author's Framework |\n|---|---|---|\n| Correspondence type | Isomorphism (static) | Natural transformation (dynamic) |\n| What corresponds | Proposition and state of affairs | Structural evolution and experiential evolution |\n| Nature of correspondence | Logical form shared | Alignment ($\\eta$) experienced |\n| Status of correspondence | Metaphysical necessity | Empirical/experiential claim |\n| Directionality | One-way (picture depicts) | Bidirectional (natural transformation) |\n\nThe author's framework can be read as a **category-theoretic generalization** of the picture theory in the following precise sense: where the Tractatus requires a *single* structural isomorphism between a proposition and a fact, the author requires a *family* of morphisms ($\\eta_a$) that are *natural* (coherent across all objects and morphisms). The naturality condition is the key upgrade --- it captures not just point-by-point correspondence but **systematic coherence** across the entire categorical structure.\n\nMoreover, the author's framework **inherits the later Wittgenstein's corrections** to the picture theory. The Tractatus picture theory fails because it cannot account for the diversity of language uses (commands, jokes, prayers, greetings --- none of which \"picture\" anything). The author's framework avoids this by making the relevant correspondence *experiential* rather than *representational*. Understanding a joke is having the right $\\eta$ between the joke's structural unfolding and one's experiential response --- no picturing required.\n\n**Assessment**: The author's framework is best understood not as a generalization of the picture theory *per se*, but as a framework that **subsumes both** the picture theory (as a special case where $\\eta$ is an isomorphism) and the later Wittgenstein's meaning-as-use (as the general case where $\\eta$ captures experiential alignment).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Philosophical Therapy (哲学治疗)\n\n### The Author's Account\n\nIn K1策略, the author provides a structural account of why philosophical therapy works, centered on the concept of 张力 (tension) --- the state where a sub-category lacks a well-defined universal property, so that experience cannot resolve into a stable terminal point:\n\n> \"这也是哲学治疗为什么有效的原因\"\n\nThe author connects this to the idea that philosophical puzzlement arises from structural tension --- multiple potential universal properties competing without resolution --- and that therapy works by restructuring the category so that the tension is resolved.\n\n### Wittgenstein's Therapeutic Conception\n\nFor Wittgenstein, philosophical problems arise from linguistic confusions: \"philosophical problems arise when language goes on holiday\" (PI section 38). Therapy consists in \"assembling reminders for a particular purpose\" (PI section 127) --- drawing attention to how words are actually used so that the confused philosopher can see that there was no genuine problem.\n\n### The Tension\n\nThe author's account **explains** why therapy works; Wittgenstein would regard such an explanation as itself a philosophical confusion. Wittgenstein explicitly rejects the idea that philosophy should produce theories (PI section 109: \"we may not advance any kind of theory\"). For Wittgenstein, the therapeutic effect is self-evident once the confusion is cleared; there is nothing further to explain.\n\nHowever, the author's account does something that Wittgenstein's does not: it provides a **positive criterion** for when philosophical puzzlement should arise and when it should be resolved. By identifying puzzlement with categorical tension, the author can (in principle) predict which conceptual configurations will produce confusion and which will not. This is a genuinely productive extension, even if it violates Wittgenstein's quietism.\n\nFurthermore, the author's framework offers an interesting **bridge** between Wittgenstein's therapeutic approach and more constructive philosophical programs. If therapy works by resolving categorical tension, then constructive philosophy (building new frameworks, new concepts) is *also* a form of therapy --- it resolves tension not by showing that the question was confused, but by providing new categorical structure in which the tension can be resolved. This is close to what the author describes as the construction of 境.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Rule-Following and 恒常 (Constancy)\n\n### The Author's Account of Stable Structures\n\nThe concept of 恒常 (constancy) is introduced in 后形而上学 整理 as the core of metaphysical thinking:\n\n> \"形而上的核心是恒常。我们需要在变化的现象之中寻找到（追求）一种恒常性\"\n\nIn K1策略, this is formalized as stable structures $S_E$ preserved under the evolution functor $T$. The idea is that certain structural features of experience are invariant under experiential evolution --- they are the \"rules\" that constrain how experience can develop.\n\n### Wittgenstein's Rule-Following\n\nWittgenstein's rule-following considerations (PI sections 138--242) constitute one of the most profound and difficult passages in 20th-century philosophy. The central problem is: what constitutes following a rule? Wittgenstein argues against any **mentalist** or **Platonist** account of rules. A rule is not a mental state that determines its applications, nor is it an abstract object that we grasp. Rather, rule-following is a *practice* --- it consists in the regularity of a community's behavior, and there is no deeper fact that makes the behavior count as following *this* rule rather than *that* one.\n\nThe Kripkenstein paradox (Kripke's reading of Wittgenstein) sharpens this: for any finite sequence of applications, there are infinitely many rules consistent with that sequence. What determines that we are following addition rather than \"quaddition\"?\n\n### Comparison\n\nThe author's formalization of constancy as functorial invariance is in tension with Wittgenstein's anti-formalism in several ways:\n\n1. **Formalization vs. practice**: The author treats rules as mathematical invariants ($S_E$ preserved under $T$); Wittgenstein insists that rules are constituted by practice, not by any formal structure.\n\n2. **Community vs. individual**: Wittgenstein's rule-following requires a community of practitioners; the author's framework is largely individualistic (analyzing the evolution of a single person's $\\mathbb{E}_t$).\n\n3. **Determinacy**: The author's $S_E$ is (in principle) mathematically determinate; Wittgenstein argues that there is no fact of the matter about which rule is being followed apart from practice.\n\nHowever, the author's framework also has **surprising resonances** with Wittgenstein:\n\n1. **No ground-level rules**: The author explicitly states that $S_E$ is descriptive, not constitutive. The stable structures are observed regularities, not prescriptive rules. This is actually close to Wittgenstein's point: the \"rule\" is what we observe in practice, not a Platonic entity.\n\n2. **Non-uniqueness**: The author acknowledges that different choices of sub-categories and different time-ranges will yield different $S_E$. This echoes Wittgenstein's point that rule-following is context-dependent and community-relative.\n\n3. **The role of agreement**: When the author discusses philosophical experiments and the possibility of evoking shared experiences across different people, the criterion of success is structural agreement --- \"只需要他们具有相同的结构性位置.\" This is remarkably close to Wittgenstein's emphasis on \"agreement in form of life\" (PI section 241) as the basis for following the same rule.\n\n**Assessment**: The author formalizes what Wittgenstein deliberately left un-formalized. Whether this is a productive move or a misunderstanding depends on one's reading of Wittgenstein. On a therapeutic reading, it is a confusion. On a constructive reading (closer to Brandom or McDowell), it is a legitimate extension that preserves the anti-Platonist and practice-oriented spirit while adding mathematical precision.\n\n---\n\n## 6. On Certainty and the Knowledge Essay\n\n### The Author's Argument\n\nIn \"A Thought on Knowledge,\" the author argues that knowledge reduces to belief by analyzing each component of the traditional justified true belief (JTB) definition:\n\n1. **Truth condition**: methodologically impossible --- we have access only to phenomena, never to truth directly.\n2. **Justification condition**: all justification ultimately rests on phenomena or beliefs; phenomena must be \"digested\" into beliefs to be used; therefore justification is ultimately belief about belief.\n3. **Conclusion**: knowledge is, in practice, \"what each individual believes to be correct.\"\n\n### Wittgenstein's On Certainty\n\n*On Certainty* (OC), written in the last months of Wittgenstein's life, addresses Moore's \"proof of the external world.\" Wittgenstein argues that certain propositions function not as items of knowledge but as **hinge propositions** --- they are the framework within which knowledge claims, doubts, and justifications operate. \"The questions that we raise and our doubts depend on the fact that some propositions are exempt from doubt, as it were like hinges on which those turn\" (OC section 341).\n\nKey features of hinge propositions:\n- They are not known in the traditional sense; they are the **conditions** for knowing (OC section 403).\n- They cannot be justified, but this does not make them arbitrary (OC section 559).\n- They belong to a \"system\" or \"world-picture\" (*Weltbild*) (OC section 162).\n- They can change over time as practices change (OC section 96).\n\n### Connection\n\nThe author's analysis and Wittgenstein's *On Certainty* arrive at strikingly similar conclusions through different routes:\n\n1. **Foundationalism fails**: The author shows that justification bottoms out in unjustified belief or circular justification. Wittgenstein shows that justification bottoms out in hinge propositions that are not themselves justified.\n\n2. **Practice over theory**: The author repeatedly emphasizes \"in practice\" (在实践中) --- what people actually do when they claim to know something. Wittgenstein similarly focuses on what Moore *actually does* when he says \"I know this is a hand.\"\n\n3. **Knowledge as communal standard**: The author proposes that knowledge is \"what most people in a field believe to be correct.\" Wittgenstein's world-picture is similarly communal and practice-embedded.\n\n4. **Historical contingency**: The author notes that knowledge \"changes over time (e.g., geocentrism).\" Wittgenstein explicitly allows that hinge propositions can shift (OC section 96--99).\n\nHowever, there is a significant difference. Wittgenstein would resist the reduction of knowledge to belief. For Wittgenstein, hinge propositions are **neither** known **nor** believed --- they are the framework within which the distinction between knowledge and belief operates. The author's move is more radical: dissolving the knowledge/belief distinction entirely. This is closer to **pragmatism** (James, Dewey, Rorty) than to Wittgenstein, who preserves the grammar of \"knowing\" and \"believing\" even as he transforms their philosophical significance.\n\nThe author's analysis of scientific knowledge through the lens of high-energy physics (where \"fundamental particles\" are never directly observed, only electromagnetic signals in detectors that are then reconstructed through models) is particularly compelling and parallels Wittgenstein's observation in OC section 105: \"All testing, all confirmation and disconfirmation of a hypothesis takes place already within a system.\"\n\n---\n\n## 7. Private Language and Intersubjectivity\n\n### The Author's Position\n\nAcross the essays, the author repeatedly argues that we cannot access others' inner states:\n\n> \"人类不仅永远无法真正知道其他人的真实想法\" (关于集体利益)\n\n> \"我无法真正感受到他人的内心感受\" (后形而上学 整理)\n\nYet the author proposes a criterion for communication and intersubjective verification:\n\n> \"我们不需要本体论的验证不同的人获得了'同一'体验（例如Qualia），只需要他们具有相同的结构性位置\" (K1策略)\n\n### Wittgenstein's Private Language Argument\n\nWittgenstein's private language argument (PI sections 243--315) argues that a language whose terms refer to the speaker's private sensations, knowable only to the speaker, is impossible. The key moves:\n\n1. A private linguist cannot establish a criterion of correctness for their sensation-terms (PI section 258).\n2. Without such a criterion, there is no distinction between following a rule and merely thinking one is following a rule (PI section 202).\n3. Therefore, the meaning of sensation-terms must be grounded in public, shared practices.\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe author's position is **deeply compatible** with the private language argument, perhaps more than the author realizes. Consider:\n\n1. **Structural position as public criterion**: The author's proposal that shared experience is verified by \"structural position\" rather than by qualitative identity is exactly the kind of **public criterion** that Wittgenstein argues sensation-terms must have. We don't need to verify that your red *feels* the same as my red; we need only verify that \"red\" occupies the same structural position in both our linguistic/experiential networks.\n\n2. **Rejection of private access**: The author's insistence that we cannot know others' inner states, combined with the claim that structural verification suffices for communication, mirrors Wittgenstein's point that the \"private object\" drops out as irrelevant to meaning (PI section 293, the \"beetle in the box\" passage).\n\n3. **Category-theoretic formalization**: The author's framework provides a precise mathematical formulation of what \"same structural position\" means: isomorphic placement within a categorical structure. This goes beyond what Wittgenstein offers but is entirely consistent with his philosophical conclusions.\n\nWhere the author diverges from Wittgenstein is in maintaining that there genuinely *are* inner states that we cannot access --- the framework preserves subjective experience as ontologically real even if epistemically inaccessible. Wittgenstein, by contrast, argues that the very picture of \"inner states\" that others cannot access is confused: \"The essential thing about private experience is really not that each person possesses his own exemplar, but that nobody knows whether other people also have this or something else\" (PI section 272). For Wittgenstein, this \"not knowing\" is not an epistemic limitation but a grammatical observation --- the concept of \"knowing another's sensation\" has no clear application.\n\n**Assessment**: The author's structural verification criterion is one of the most philosophically productive ideas in the collection, and it can be read as a **constructive implementation** of Wittgenstein's insight that meaning is public. The category-theoretic apparatus provides precisely the tools needed to make \"same structural position\" rigorous. For the full account of how the natural transformation $\\eta$ serves as the mechanism of intersubjective verification --- and how the naturality condition itself functions as the public criterion, giving mathematical content to the beetle-in-the-box insight --- see Supplementary Section S1 below.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Forms of Life and 境/梦境\n\n### Wittgenstein's Forms of Life (Lebensformen)\n\n\"Forms of life\" is one of the most evocative and under-determined concepts in Wittgenstein. It appears only a handful of times in the *Investigations* (PI sections 19, 23, 241; PI p. 226). Its precise meaning is debated, but the central idea is that language games are embedded in broader patterns of human activity, behavior, and agreement. \"To imagine a language means to imagine a form of life\" (PI section 19).\n\nForms of life are:\n- **Not reducible to rules or structures**: they include the \"weave of life\" --- behaviors, reactions, training, natural history.\n- **The given**: \"What has to be accepted, the given, is --- so one could say --- forms of life\" (PI p. 226).\n- **Neither subjective nor objective**: they are the shared background against which subjectivity and objectivity make sense.\n\n### The Author's 境 and 梦境\n\nThe author's 境 ($\\mathbb{E}$) is defined as a categorical structure on phenomena ($\\mathfrak{P}$): experiences as objects, associations (联想) as morphisms, forming a tower structure. 梦境 is the \"environment\" in which meaning becomes possible --- the \"packaging\" of experience within which purposes and significance arise.\n\n### Comparison\n\nThere are genuine parallels:\n\n1. **Background for meaning**: Both forms of life and 境 serve as the background against which meaning, understanding, and purpose operate. Neither is itself an object of direct scrutiny --- both are the medium *in which* we think and act.\n\n2. **Given-ness**: The author's insistence that we cannot escape all 境 (\"抛弃所有的梦境即是不可能的\") parallels Wittgenstein's claim that forms of life are \"the given.\"\n\n3. **Multiplicity**: The author allows for multiple sub-categories ($\\mathcal{E}_L$, $\\mathcal{E}_M$, $\\mathcal{E}_K$) within $\\mathbb{E}$; Wittgenstein allows for multiple, overlapping forms of life.\n\nHowever, the differences are also significant:\n\n1. **Formalization**: 境 is explicitly formalized using category theory; Wittgenstein's forms of life are deliberately left informal. Wittgenstein would likely regard the formalization as a category mistake --- forms of life are not the kind of thing that *can* be formalized, because they include precisely those aspects of human activity that resist formalization.\n\n2. **Individualism vs. communalism**: 境 is fundamentally individual (each person has their own $\\mathbb{E}_t$); forms of life are fundamentally communal (they are shared patterns of activity). This is a deep philosophical difference. The author addresses intersubjectivity through structural correspondence, but the starting point is the individual subject.\n\n3. **Static vs. dynamic**: The author's 境 evolves ($T_t: \\mathbb{E}_t \\to \\mathbb{E}_{t+1}$); Wittgenstein's forms of life are relatively stable (they change historically but are not theorized as evolving).\n\n4. **Dreamscape metaphor**: 梦境 (dreamscape) --- particularly the distinction between 沉醉 (immersed/intoxicated) and 清醒 (lucid/awake) --- introduces an element of **self-awareness** that has no direct parallel in Wittgenstein. The idea of a \"lucid dream\" where one is fully invested yet fully aware of the constructed nature of the meaning-structure goes beyond Wittgenstein's framework. This is more reminiscent of Heidegger's distinction between authentic and inauthentic existence, or of the Buddhist concept of mindfulness within samsara.\n\n**Assessment**: 境 is best understood not as a formalization of Wittgenstein's forms of life, but as a **parallel concept** developed from different philosophical motivations. Forms of life are the communal background of meaning; 境 is the individual structural medium of experience. The two concepts address overlapping philosophical territory but from different starting points and with different emphases.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Translation Challenges\n\n### Key Terms with Wittgensteinian Resonance\n\nThe following terms require careful handling in translation due to their proximity to --- but divergence from --- established Wittgensteinian terminology:\n\n**语言游戏 (language games)**: The standard translation of Wittgenstein's *Sprachspiele* is \"language games.\" The author uses the same Chinese term but with a different emphasis: as a methodological tool for discovering stable structures rather than as the bedrock of meaning. Translators should use \"language games\" but add a note distinguishing the author's usage from Wittgenstein's. Consider: \"language games (in the methodological sense)\" on first occurrence, then simply \"language games\" thereafter.\n\n**哲学治疗 (philosophical therapy)**: This translates straightforwardly as \"philosophical therapy,\" which is the standard rendering of Wittgenstein's concept. But since the author gives it a structural explanation (resolution of categorical tension), a translator's note should clarify the difference.\n\n**结构 (structure)** and **意义 (meaning)**: These are the central terms in the structure/meaning question. \"Structure\" and \"meaning\" are straightforward, but the translator should be aware that the author's use of \"meaning\" is experiential/phenomenological rather than truth-conditional or referential.\n\n**理解 (understanding) vs. 掌握 (mastery/grasp)**: This distinction is philosophically crucial. The author defines 掌握 as the special case where $\\eta_a$ is the identity --- a \"direct confirmation sense\" without mediation. This corresponds to what Wittgenstein calls \"understanding\" in its most robust sense. I recommend translating 理解 as \"understanding\" and 掌握 as \"mastery\" or \"direct grasp,\" with a note explaining that the latter is a technical term in the author's framework corresponding to the identity natural transformation.\n\n**恒常 (constancy)**: This is the author's term for the invariance at the heart of metaphysics. \"Constancy\" is adequate but risks confusion with Husserl's \"constancy\" (*Bestandigkeit*). \"Invariance\" captures the mathematical sense better, but \"constancy\" preserves the more phenomenological register. I recommend \"constancy\" with a parenthetical \"(invariance)\" on first occurrence.\n\n**境**: See the full dictionary entry below. This is the most challenging term.\n\n**规则 (rules)**: Standard translation. But note that the author's \"rules\" are stable structures ($S_E$), not Wittgensteinian rule-following practices.\n\n### Critical Translation Implication: Experiential Sequence is Load-Bearing\n\nThe recognition that many passages in these essays function as **philosophical experiments** (see Supplementary Section S2 below) has a major implication for translation: **the experiential sequence of examples is load-bearing, not merely illustrative**. Translators must preserve the precise ordering, pacing, and experiential progression of the author's examples, because these sequences are designed to construct specific experiential structures in the reader.\n\nConcretely:\n\n1. **The Sisyphus -> office worker -> entrepreneur -> cat sequence** in 西西弗斯、班与猫 is a carefully staged dissolution. Each example builds on the previous one by modifying a single variable. Reordering, condensing, or abstracting this sequence would destroy the experiment --- the reader would not undergo the intended experiential progression from \"absurdity is inherent in repetition\" to \"absurdity is absent in intrinsically motivated repetition.\"\n\n2. **The 道德仁义礼 reversal** in 后形而上学 整理 requires the reader to first hold the traditional top-down ordering, then step-by-step experience its inversion. If a translator were to summarize this as \"the author argues that the traditional ordering is inverted,\" the philosophical experiment would be lost --- the reader would receive a proposition rather than undergoing an experiential restructuring.\n\n3. **The \"1+1=2\" and meme-sentence examples** in K1策略 require the reader to introspect in real time: first experiencing understanding (the $\\eta$ of \"1+1=2\"), then experiencing the *failure* of understanding (the meme sentence). Paraphrasing or footnoting these away would remove the experimental core.\n\n4. **The Ship of Theseus and \"what is a person?\" examples** in 范畴论与境 整理 are designed to evoke the universal property as a *felt experience*. The reader is supposed to notice the feeling itself, not just understand the proposition about it.\n\nThis means translators should treat these passages with the same care a literary translator gives to the pacing of a novel or the line breaks of a poem. The sequences are not decorative illustrations of abstract points; they are the philosophical argument itself, conducted in the register of experience. From a Wittgensteinian perspective, this is exactly right: for Wittgenstein, the examples *are* the philosophy (PI section 133), and any attempt to extract \"the point\" from the examples and present it abstractly is already a distortion.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Overall Significance\n\n### Does the Framework Achieve Something Wittgenstein Attempted?\n\nThe relationship between this framework and Wittgenstein's philosophy is best characterized as **complementary rather than duplicative**. Wittgenstein sought to dissolve philosophical problems by showing that they arise from linguistic confusions. The author seeks to **describe the structure of experience** in a way that makes philosophical problems tractable --- either dissolvable (by showing that they arise from categorical tension) or answerable (by mapping experiential structures through formal tools).\n\nThe deepest convergence is in the **anti-foundationalist** character of both projects:\n- Wittgenstein: there is no foundation beneath language games and forms of life; they are the given.\n- The author: there is no 第〇实在 (zeroth reality) accessible to us; phenomena are the 第一实在 (first reality), and all metaphysics is constructed *upon* phenomena.\n\nThe deepest divergence is in their attitudes toward **formalization**:\n- Wittgenstein: formalization is part of the disease, not the cure. Philosophical problems arise precisely from our attempt to force the richness of language use into formal molds.\n- The author: formalization (specifically, category theory) is a useful tool that, properly wielded, can illuminate the structure of experience without claiming to capture its essence.\n\n### Is the Category-Theoretic Formalization Productive?\n\nI believe it is, for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Natural transformations capture something real about understanding**. The idea that understanding is the alignment between structural evolution and experiential evolution, formalized as a natural transformation, is a genuinely illuminating philosophical proposal. It gives mathematical content to the vague notion of \"grasping\" meaning, and it does so in a way that is consistent with Wittgensteinian insights about the primacy of use and practice.\n\n2. **The structural verification criterion resolves a genuine problem**. Wittgenstein's private language argument establishes that meaning must be public, but it does not provide a positive account of *how* public meaning works. The author's structural position criterion fills this gap.\n\n3. **The framework is self-limiting**. The author repeatedly insists on the descriptive (rather than constitutive) character of the framework, and on the tool-like status of category theory. This self-limitation prevents the framework from falling into the kind of metaphysical dogmatism that Wittgenstein criticizes.\n\n4. **Connection to empirical verification**. The proposal for \"philosophical experiments\" --- constructing experiences with specific structural properties and verifying that they evoke the predicted experiential responses --- is a genuinely novel contribution to philosophical methodology. This goes beyond what Wittgenstein, the formal semanticists, or the speech act theorists have proposed.\n\nHowever, a Wittgensteinian critic would rightly note:\n- The framework may create new philosophical confusions even as it resolves old ones (e.g., reifying \"stable structures\" in experience).\n- The mathematical apparatus may obscure rather than illuminate for readers not trained in category theory.\n- The individualist starting point may miss the essentially communal character of meaning that Wittgenstein emphasizes.\n\n### Positioning in the Field\n\nWithin contemporary philosophy of language, this framework occupies a distinctive position:\n- It shares **inferentialism's** (Brandom) emphasis on structural relations over reference, but replaces inferential roles with categorical structures.\n- It shares **dynamic semantics'** emphasis on meaning as process, but operates at a more fundamental level (experience rather than discourse).\n- It shares **phenomenology's** (Husserl, Heidegger) emphasis on lived experience, but provides mathematical tools for structural analysis.\n- It inherits **Wittgenstein's** anti-foundationalism and emphasis on practice, but converts therapeutic insights into constructive resources.\n\nThe result is something genuinely new: a **structural phenomenology of meaning** that uses category theory as its formal backbone. Whether this will prove philosophically fruitful in the long run depends on whether the framework can generate specific, testable insights about the structure of understanding --- and the author's proposal for philosophical experiments suggests a path toward doing exactly that.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix: Notes on Individual Essays\n\n### 关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一\nFrom a philosophy of language perspective, the most interesting move here is the analogy between macro-level concepts (collective interest) and the renormalization group in physics. This parallels Wittgenstein's observation that concepts can operate at different \"levels\" without reducing to their micro-level constituents (cf. PI section 71 on family resemblance). The author's claim that \"人类不仅永远无法真正知道其他人的真实想法\" anticipates the private language considerations developed more fully in later essays.\n\n### A Thought on Knowledge\nThis essay is the most directly relevant to analytic epistemology and to *On Certainty*. The systematic stripping away of JTB components is clear and effective. The approach of focusing on \"how we access\" justification bases rather than \"what they are\" is thoroughly Wittgensteinian in spirit.\n\n### 西西弗斯、班与猫\nThe dissolution of absurdism through the concept of internally generated meaning (养猫) is philosophically elegant. From a Wittgensteinian perspective, the key insight is that meaning does not require articulation or justification --- the cat-owner does not need to state *why* cat care is meaningful. This resonates with Wittgenstein's observation that forms of life do not require external justification; they are the given. **This essay is itself a philosophical experiment** (see S2, Experiment 1): the Sisyphus -> worker -> entrepreneur -> cat sequence is a carefully staged experiential progression designed to dissolve absurdity in the reader's own experience. The translation must preserve the exact sequence and pacing.\n\n### 后形而上学 整理\nThe layered analysis of metaphysics (Types 0-3) and the \"inversion\" of 道德仁义礼 is sophisticated. The concept of 恒常 as the core of metaphysical thinking is a genuine contribution. The distinction between 第一实在 (phenomena) and 第二实在 (constructed reality) maps partially onto Wittgenstein's distinction between what is given and what is constructed in language, though the author's framework is more explicitly ontological.\n\n### 形而上学后的目的：诗意\nThe distinction between 沉醉 (immersed) and 清醒 (lucid) dreamscapes is philosophically original. It offers a way of being meaning-engaged that is neither naive (pre-critical) nor nihilistic (post-critical). This has no direct Wittgensteinian parallel but is consistent with the later Wittgenstein's acceptance of forms of life as \"the given.\"\n\n### 范畴论与境 整理\nThis is where the formal apparatus is developed. The identification of associations (联想) with morphisms, and the tower structure of experience, are the framework's most technically innovative features. The examples (Ship of Theseus, \"what is a person?\", dragon's blood) effectively illustrate how the formal tools apply to traditional philosophical problems.\n\n### 范畴论与境：K1策略\nThis is the framework's culminating essay. The natural transformation analysis of understanding, the structural verification criterion, and the proposal for philosophical experiments are the most philosophically significant contributions. The explicit engagement with language games and philosophical therapy shows the author's awareness of the Wittgensteinian tradition.\n\n### 关于诗意和境的一些零散想法\nThis collection of notes extends and applies the framework. The self-referential observation that we are already constructing 境 in everyday life --- choosing clothes, decorating rooms, taking photographs --- grounds the abstract framework in lived practice, which is the most Wittgensteinian gesture in the entire collection.\n\n---\n\n## Supplementary Analysis: Two Follow-Up Topics\n\n### S1. Intersubjectivity via the Natural Transformation $\\eta$\n\nThe author suggests that the natural transformation $\\eta$ is the mechanism through which intersubjective verification is possible. Let me trace how this works and assess it from a Wittgensteinian perspective.\n\n#### The Mechanism\n\nConsider two people, Alice and Bob, both reading the sentence \"The cat jumped on the table\" (猫跳上了桌子). In K1策略, understanding this sentence requires a natural transformation between the sentence's structural evolution (its syntactic unfolding) and one's experiential evolution (the mental simulation of the event). If Alice has an $\\eta^A$ and Bob has an $\\eta^B$, the question of intersubjectivity becomes: do Alice and Bob understand the same thing?\n\nThe author's answer (K1策略 methodology point 3) is that we do not need ontological verification that $\\eta^A$ and $\\eta^B$ are qualitatively identical --- we need only that they occupy the same **structural position**. That is, if Alice's $\\eta^A$ relates the same objects and morphisms in the same way as Bob's $\\eta^B$, then their understanding is commensurable.\n\nMore precisely: the naturality condition requires that $\\eta$ commutes with all morphisms in the source category. This means $\\eta$ is not a free-floating subjective response but a **structurally constrained** response. Two people whose $\\eta$'s satisfy the same naturality diagrams are, in a rigorous mathematical sense, aligned --- even if the \"felt quality\" of their $\\eta$'s differs. The commutative diagram itself is the public, shareable criterion of understanding.\n\n#### Wittgensteinian Assessment\n\nThis is, I believe, the most philosophically significant move in the entire collection, and it represents a **genuine advance** on the intersubjectivity problem that goes beyond what Wittgenstein himself achieved. Here is why.\n\nWittgenstein's treatment of intersubjectivity operates on two levels:\n\n1. **The Private Language Argument (PI sections 243--315)**: Meaning must be public. The \"beetle in the box\" thought experiment (PI section 293) shows that if everyone has a box with something in it that only they can see, the \"something\" drops out of the language game --- what matters is the *role* of \"beetle\" in our shared practice, not its private content.\n\n2. **Agreement in Form of Life (PI section 241)**: \"So you are saying that human agreement decides what is true and what is false?\" --- \"It is what human beings *say* that is true and false; and they agree in the *language* they use. That is not agreement in opinions but in form of life.\"\n\nWittgenstein establishes that meaning is public and that intersubjective agreement is grounded in shared form of life. But he does not provide a **mechanism** for how this works. He would resist providing one, on therapeutic grounds --- the question \"how does intersubjective understanding work?\" is, for the quietist, already a confused question (understanding is not a process; cf. PI section 154).\n\nThe author's natural transformation framework provides what Wittgenstein deliberately withholds: a **positive structural account** of intersubjective alignment. The key insight is that **the naturality condition is itself the public criterion**. Consider:\n\n- The naturality square for $\\eta$ is a mathematical structure that can be checked, tested, and communicated.\n- Two people who both satisfy the naturality condition for the same source category are provably aligned in their structural responses.\n- This alignment does not require access to anyone's private experience --- it requires only that both people's responses are coherent with the same categorical structure.\n\nThis is precisely analogous to Wittgenstein's beetle-in-the-box: the private content ($\\eta^A$ vs $\\eta^B$ as felt experiences) drops out; what remains is the structural role ($\\eta$ as a natural transformation satisfying commutative diagrams). The author has given **mathematical content** to the beetle-in-the-box insight.\n\nFurthermore, the naturality condition addresses the **Kripkenstein problem** (Kripke's skeptical reading of Wittgenstein on rule-following). Kripke asks: what fact about me determines that I mean addition rather than \"quaddition\" by \"+\"? The author's framework suggests an answer: the fact that my $\\eta$ satisfies the naturality condition for the categorical structure of arithmetic. If my $\\eta$ is natural (commutes with all morphisms), then my understanding is structurally determined --- there is no room for quaddition-like deviance, because the naturality condition constrains $\\eta$ globally, not just at finitely many points. This is not Kripke's \"skeptical solution\" (meaning as community agreement) but something closer to a **structural solution**: meaning is fixed by the naturality constraint itself.\n\nHowever, a Wittgensteinian would raise the following concern: **who verifies the naturality condition?** If Alice checks whether Bob's $\\eta$ commutes with all morphisms, she must access Bob's $\\eta$ --- which is, by hypothesis, an experience in Bob's $\\mathbb{E}$. The author's response would presumably be the philosophical experiment methodology: construct situations designed to test whether specific components of $\\eta$ are present, and check for replicable behavioral responses. This converts the naturality check into an empirical procedure, which is consistent with Wittgenstein's emphasis on practice. But it also shows that **intersubjective verification is always partial and practical** --- we can check finitely many components of $\\eta$ through experiments, but we can never verify the full naturality condition. This partial, practical character is, I think, exactly right, and it is exactly what Wittgenstein would predict: agreement is always agreement in what we *do*, not in some metaphysical fact about shared understanding.\n\n**Key conclusion**: The natural transformation $\\eta$ provides a **structural criterion for intersubjective commensurability** that is (1) consistent with the private language argument's conclusion that meaning is public, (2) more specific than Wittgenstein's appeal to \"agreement in form of life,\" and (3) potentially testable through the philosophical experiment methodology. This is a genuine contribution to philosophy of language.\n\n#### Translation Note (Addendum to Dictionary)\n\nThe term 主体间性 should be translated as **intersubjectivity**. In the author's framework, intersubjectivity is not grounded in empathy, shared consciousness, or transcendental structures, but in **structural commensurability** --- the sharing of naturality conditions. This is distinct from Husserl's intersubjectivity (grounded in empathic appresentation), Habermas's (grounded in communicative rationality), and Wittgenstein's (grounded in agreement in form of life). The author's is perhaps closest to Brandom's inferentialism, where intersubjectivity is constituted by the mutual recognition of inferential commitments.\n\n---\n\n### S2. The Essays as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThe author proposes that \"philosophical experiments\" consist in constructing examples with specific structures to awaken specific experiences in readers, then checking whether those experiences are replicable (K1策略, methodology point 3). The author further suggests in \"写在最后\" that this practice is already ubiquitous: poetry, literature, art, music, games, memes, and even decorating one's room are all instances of constructing 境 to awaken experience.\n\nRe-reading the essays with this lens reveals that **several passages are indeed functioning as philosophical experiments** --- they are not merely *describing* philosophical positions but are actively *constructing* experiential structures in the reader. Let me identify the most significant instances.\n\n#### Experiment 1: The Sisyphus/Cat Essay as Dissolution of Absurdity\n\nThe essay 西西弗斯、班与猫 has a very specific argumentative structure that functions as a philosophical experiment:\n\n1. **Setup (establishing the target experience)**: The reader is invited to feel the absurdity of Sisyphus's situation, and then the absurdity of the office worker's situation. These are familiar scenarios; most readers will have a pre-existing $\\eta$ that connects \"repetitive labor\" with \"absurdity.\"\n\n2. **Pivot (disrupting the structural alignment)**: The author introduces the entrepreneur --- structurally identical labor, but no absurdity. This forces the reader to notice that their $\\eta$ between \"repetition\" and \"absurdity\" was not intrinsic but contingent on **alienation** (the meaning being external).\n\n3. **Dissolution (constructing a new $\\eta$)**: The cat example. Here the author constructs a scenario that is structurally identical to Sisyphus (repetitive, effortful, no cosmic purpose) but where the experience of absurdity is simply **absent**. The rhetorical force of this example depends on the reader *actually experiencing* the absence of absurdity when thinking about cat care. The sentence \"没有一个养猫的人会感到荒谬，荒谬从未来过\" is designed to trigger the reader's introspective verification: *Is this true? Do I feel absurdity when I think about caring for a cat?* The expected answer is no, and this no is itself the philosophical experiment's result.\n\nFrom a Wittgensteinian perspective, this is a paradigmatic example of **philosophical therapy conducted through examples** --- exactly what Wittgenstein does in the *Investigations*. Consider PI section 66, where Wittgenstein asks the reader to \"look and see\" whether there is something common to all games. The rhetorical structure is identical: Wittgenstein constructs a series of examples, invites the reader to introspect, and expects a specific experiential result (the *absence* of a common feature). The cat example works the same way: the author constructs a scenario, invites introspection, and expects the *absence* of absurdity.\n\nWhat makes this a philosophical *experiment* rather than merely a philosophical *argument* is that **the reader's introspective response is the evidence**. If the reader *does* feel absurdity when thinking about cat care, the experiment has failed for that reader, and the philosophical claim is not established. The claim is empirical-experiential, not logically necessary.\n\nThis is genuinely Wittgensteinian in method, even if the author's framework provides a more structural account of *why* the method works (the examples construct specific categorical structures that do or do not support a natural transformation involving \"absurdity\").\n\n#### Experiment 2: The 道德仁义礼 Reversal as Restructuring of the Reader's 境\n\nThe 道德仁义礼 passage in 后形而上学 整理 functions as a different kind of philosophical experiment --- one aimed at **restructuring** the reader's 境 rather than dissolving a specific feeling.\n\nThe passage proceeds in several steps:\n\n1. **The traditional ordering is presented**: 道 -> 德 -> 仁 -> 义 -> 礼. This is the familiar top-down metaphysical picture. Most readers educated in Chinese philosophy will have an existing $\\eta$ aligning this ordering with their understanding of the concepts.\n\n2. **The author introduces \"现象礼\"**: The reader is asked to recall the actual *experience* of ritual behavior --- how it feels, from the inside, to behave ritually toward others. This is a request for introspection.\n\n3. **The reversal is performed step by step**: 现象礼 -> 现象义 -> 现象仁 -> 德 -> 道. Each step is justified by appeal to the reader's own experience: \"this feeling is what you actually experience\" (切实感受到的). The reader is being guided through a reconstruction of their own experiential categories.\n\n4. **The inversion is made explicit**: \"整个逻辑的顺序就被倒反过来.\" The reader is invited to experience the *shift* --- the moment when the traditional ordering \"flips\" and the reader sees that what they took to be foundational (道) was actually derived (from 现象礼).\n\nFrom a Wittgensteinian perspective, this is a **perspicuous presentation** (*ubersichtliche Darstellung*, PI section 122) --- a rearrangement of what was already known that produces a new way of seeing. Wittgenstein's own method in the *Investigations* is precisely this: he does not introduce new facts but rearranges familiar facts so that we see them differently. The duck-rabbit (PI p. 194) is the iconic example: the same figure, seen differently.\n\nBut the 道德仁义礼 passage is more than a static perspicuous presentation --- it is a **guided restructuring** of the reader's experiential categories. The reader's $\\mathcal{E}$ is being actively reorganized: the meta-order of 道, 德, 仁, 义, 礼 is being inverted. If the experiment succeeds, the reader emerges with a different categorical structure --- one where phenomena are foundational and metaphysical concepts are derived. This is a restructuring of the reader's 境 itself.\n\nThis is something Wittgenstein does implicitly but never theorizes. The author, by providing the category-theoretic framework, can now describe *what happens* when a philosophical example restructures one's understanding: it changes the meta-ordering of objects in $\\mathcal{E}$, potentially changing which objects serve as universal properties, and thereby changing the reader's metaphysical commitments.\n\n#### Experiment 3: The \"1+1=2\" Passage as Evoking $\\eta$\n\nIn K1策略, the passage where the author asks the reader to introspect on the experience of understanding \"1+1=2\" is itself a philosophical experiment. The reader is asked:\n\n- Do you experience a \"direct confirmation sense\" when you see \"1+1=2\"?\n- Is this different from the experience of checking your answer against a reference?\n- Can you recognize the experience of $\\eta$ as identity (掌握) versus $\\eta$ as non-trivial (理解 without 掌握)?\n\nThe passage about the meme sentence \"你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国，记住我给出的原理\" is particularly effective: the reader is asked to notice the *failure* of $\\eta$ --- the experience of **not understanding** despite grammatical correctness. This negative result (the absence of alignment) is just as experimentally significant as the positive case.\n\n#### Experiment 4: The 忒修斯之船 (Ship of Theseus) as Evoking the Universal Property\n\nIn 范畴论与境 整理, the Ship of Theseus discussion asks the reader to introspect: \"When you think of the Ship of Theseus, what do you experience?\" The expected answer is a specific *feeling* --- the feeling that accompanies the concept of this particular ship, which is the universal property of the sub-category $\\mathcal{E}_{\\text{Theseus}}$. The author then shows that choosing $\\mathfrak{P}$ as the physical world leads to the paradox (the universal property becomes \"emptiness\"), while choosing $\\mathfrak{P}$ as phenomena resolves it (the universal property is the *feeling* of \"this ship\"). The reader is invited to verify this through introspection: \"Is the identity of the Ship of Theseus located in the physical planks or in my experience of the ship?\"\n\n#### Wittgensteinian Assessment of the Experimental Method\n\nWittgenstein would have a complex reaction to the philosophical experiment methodology:\n\n**What he would endorse**: The centrality of concrete examples, the appeal to introspective verification, the refusal to argue from abstract principles alone. These are all Wittgensteinian virtues. PI section 593: \"A main cause of philosophical disease --- a one-sided diet: one nourishes one's thinking with only one kind of example.\"\n\n**What he would resist**: The idea that introspective responses can be treated as *data* for a structural theory. For Wittgenstein, the examples are **self-sufficient** --- they do not serve a higher theoretical purpose. They are not evidence for a theory about natural transformations; they are the thing itself. The moment you treat introspective responses as data points in a structural theory, you have, from Wittgenstein's perspective, taken a step away from the phenomena and toward a philosophical construction.\n\n**What is genuinely new**: The author's key innovation is the claim that philosophical experiments can be designed *in advance* by specifying the categorical structure that should evoke the target experience. This is the reverse of Wittgenstein's method: Wittgenstein finds examples that dissolve existing confusions; the author proposes to *construct* examples that produce *specific predicted* experiences. This is a move from therapeutic philosophy to what we might call **constructive experimental phenomenology**. It has no precedent in Wittgenstein, though it has affinities with Austin's method of constructing specific speech-act scenarios to test linguistic intuitions. (Austin also believed that carefully constructed examples could serve as evidence for philosophical claims about language.)\n\n**The deepest insight**: The author's observation that the essays *themselves* are philosophical experiments --- not just descriptions of a theory but active interventions in the reader's experiential structure --- collapses the distinction between philosophical writing and philosophical practice. This is actually the most Wittgensteinian thing in the entire collection, because it embodies Wittgenstein's claim that philosophy is an *activity* (Tractatus 4.112), not a body of doctrine. The essays do not merely *say* that meaning is experiential alignment; they *show* it by constructing experiences in the reader. The medium is the message. This is philosophy as performance, as practice --- which is, in the end, what Wittgenstein always insisted philosophy should be.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":359,"oldLines":7,"newStart":359,"newLines":7,"lines":[" The dissolution of absurdism through the concept of internally generated meaning (养猫) is philosophically elegant.

Language Games in the Framework\n\n### The Author's Usage of 语言游戏 (Language Games)\n\nIn K1策略, the author explicitly invokes the concept of 语言游戏 (language games) as a method for investigating stable structures ($S_L$) within the linguistic sub-category $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$. The key passage states:\n\n> \"于是我们就可以通过语言游戏研究语言演化中的稳定结构 $S_L$，来间接获得对 $\\mathbb{E}_t$ 中 $S_E$ 的认识\"\n\nThis usage represents a **productive but significantly reoriented extension** of Wittgenstein's concept. In the *Philosophical Investigations*, language games serve multiple functions: they are simplified models of language use (PI section 2), they illustrate the multiplicity and heterogeneity of linguistic practices (PI section 23), and they are bound up with \"forms of life\" (PI section 23). Crucially, for Wittgenstein, language games are **not instruments for discovering underlying structures**. They are the thing itself --- the level at which meaning operates. There is no deeper structure that language games reveal; rather, language games *are* the bedrock.\n\nThe author, by contrast, treats language games as **probes** --- methodological instruments that, through the functor $(F_{E,L})_t$, can map linguistic stable structures onto experiential stable structures. This is closer to what we might call a **constructive-structuralist** appropriation of language games. Wittgenstein would likely resist this move, since for him the idea that language games reveal hidden invariants would itself be a philosophical confusion --- the very kind of theorizing he sought to dissolve.\n\nHowever, the author's framework is more subtle than a naive structuralism. The author acknowledges that the mapping $(F_{E,L})_t(S_L) \\approx S_E$ is only approximate, that it captures at best a partial overlap, and that the relationship is descriptive rather than constitutive. This qualification brings the author somewhat closer to Wittgenstein's therapeutic spirit: the framework does not claim to have found the *essence* of meaning, but rather offers a tool for mapping certain structural relationships.\n\n### Therapeutic vs. Constructive Conceptions\n\nWittgenstein's conception of philosophy is famously therapeutic: \"The philosopher treats a question; like an illness\" (PI section 255). The aim is not to construct theories but to dissolve confusions by achieving a \"perspicuous presentation\" (*ubersichtliche Darstellung*, PI section 122). PI section 133 states: \"The real discovery is the one that enables me to break off doing philosophy when I want to.\"\n\nThe author explicitly mentions 哲学治疗 (philosophical therapy) in K1策略 and claims that the framework explains why it works --- roughly, through the resolution of \"tension\" (张力) when experiential sub-categories lack a well-defined universal property. This is a **structural explanation of why therapy works**, which is itself a constructive philosophical move. Wittgenstein would not attempt to explain *why* therapy works in structural-mathematical terms; for him, the therapy works by showing us the way out of the fly-bottle (PI section 309), not by constructing a formal account of fly-bottles.\n\n**Assessment**: The author's use of language games is a **departure** from Wittgenstein's anti-theoretical stance, but it is a **self-aware departure**. The author does not claim to be doing what Wittgenstein did; rather, the author uses Wittgenstein's concept as one input among many in a constructive framework. This is closer to how Robert Brandom appropriates Wittgenstein --- taking the insight about the primacy of practice and embedding it within a systematic philosophical project --- than to the quietist reading of Wittgenstein associated with Cora Diamond and James Conant.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Meaning and Structure: 是结构先于意义，还是意义先于结构？\n\n### The Author's Resolution via Natural Transformations\n\nIn K1策略, the author asks: does structure precede meaning, or meaning precede structure? The resolution is given through the natural transformation framework:\n\n> \"结构和意义之间的关系是自然变换：一句话能够被理解，他必须能够在心理过程的演化和结构的演化中达成如上所述的这种一致性感受$\\eta$\"\n\nThis is a striking move. The author refuses the dichotomy by arguing that structure and meaning are related by a **natural transformation** --- neither generates the other, but they must be **aligned**. Understanding ($\\eta$) is precisely the experience of this alignment.\n\n### Relation to Wittgenstein's Meaning-as-Use\n\nWittgenstein's meaning-as-use thesis (PI section 43: \"the meaning of a word is its use in the language\") dissolves the structure/meaning dichotomy from a different direction. For Wittgenstein, there is no pre-linguistic meaning that structure then encodes, nor is there a pure structure that then generates meaning. Meaning simply *is* the pattern of use within a language game embedded in a form of life.\n\nThe author's framework can be read as a **formalization of why Wittgenstein's dissolution works**. If structure and meaning are related by natural transformation rather than by generation, then asking which comes first is indeed a confused question --- just as Wittgenstein suggests. The natural transformation framework gives mathematical content to the Wittgensteinian insight that meaning and use are co-constitutive.\n\nHowever, there is a crucial difference. For Wittgenstein, meaning-as-use is meant to *stop* philosophical theorizing about meaning. The point is that once we see that meaning is use, there is nothing further to explain. The author, by contrast, uses the dissolution of the dichotomy as a *starting point* for further structural analysis. This is characteristic of the author's general approach: taking Wittgensteinian therapeutic insights and converting them into constructive theoretical resources.\n\n### Contrast with Formal Semantics\n\nIn truth-conditional formal semantics (Montague, Davidson, Tarski), meaning is identified with truth-conditions, and structure (syntactic/logical form) determines meaning via compositional rules. This is a clear \"structure precedes meaning\" position. The author's framework differs from this in several ways:\n\n1. **No appeal to truth**: The author's framework, consistent with the Knowledge essay, does not invoke truth-conditions. Meaning is experiential alignment ($\\eta$), not truth-value assignment.\n2. **Bidirectionality**: Formal semantics maps structure to meaning; the author's natural transformation allows influence in both directions.\n3. **Dynamic character**: Formal semantics is typically static (a sentence has its meaning at a time); the author's framework is inherently evolutionary ($t \\to t+1$).\n\nThe author's position has more in common with **dynamic semantics** (Kamp, Heim, Groenendijk & Stokhof) and with **inferentialist semantics** (Brandom), where meaning is constituted by inferential role and responsive to context, than with classical Montague grammar.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The Picture Theory and Natural Transformations\n\n### Tractatus Picture Theory\n\nThe early Wittgenstein's picture theory (Tractatus 2.1--2.225) posits that propositions are pictures of reality. A picture shares \"logical form\" with what it depicts (T 2.18). The picture \"reaches up to reality\" (T 2.1511) through a structural isomorphism between the elements of the picture and the elements of the state of affairs.\n\n### The Author's Natural Transformation Framework\n\nThe author's framework posits that understanding occurs when the evolution of a formal structure (e.g., mathematics, language) and the evolution of experience are related by a natural transformation. The $\\eta_a$ component measures the alignment between two paths from structure to experience.\n\n### Comparison\n\nThere is a **genuine structural parallel**. Both frameworks posit that the relationship between language/formalism and reality/experience is mediated by **structural correspondence**. However, the differences are substantial:\n\n| Feature | Tractatus Picture Theory | Author's Framework |\n|---|---|---|\n| Correspondence type | Isomorphism (static) | Natural transformation (dynamic) |\n| What corresponds | Proposition and state of affairs | Structural evolution and experiential evolution |\n| Nature of correspondence | Logical form shared | Alignment ($\\eta$) experienced |\n| Status of correspondence | Metaphysical necessity | Empirical/experiential claim |\n| Directionality | One-way (picture depicts) | Bidirectional (natural transformation) |\n\nThe author's framework can be read as a **category-theoretic generalization** of the picture theory in the following precise sense: where the Tractatus requires a *single* structural isomorphism between a proposition and a fact, the author requires a *family* of morphisms ($\\eta_a$) that are *natural* (coherent across all objects and morphisms). The naturality condition is the key upgrade --- it captures not just point-by-point correspondence but **systematic coherence** across the entire categorical structure.\n\nMoreover, the author's framework **inherits the later Wittgenstein's corrections** to the picture theory. The Tractatus picture theory fails because it cannot account for the diversity of language uses (commands, jokes, prayers, greetings --- none of which \"picture\" anything). The author's framework avoids this by making the relevant correspondence *experiential* rather than *representational*. Understanding a joke is having the right $\\eta$ between the joke's structural unfolding and one's experiential response --- no picturing required.\n\n**Assessment**: The author's framework is best understood not as a generalization of the picture theory *per se*, but as a framework that **subsumes both** the picture theory (as a special case where $\\eta$ is an isomorphism) and the later Wittgenstein's meaning-as-use (as the general case where $\\eta$ captures experiential alignment).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Philosophical Therapy (哲学治疗)\n\n### The Author's Account\n\nIn K1策略, the author provides a structural account of why philosophical therapy works, centered on the concept of 张力 (tension) --- the state where a sub-category lacks a well-defined universal property, so that experience cannot resolve into a stable terminal point:\n\n> \"这也是哲学治疗为什么有效的原因\"\n\nThe author connects this to the idea that philosophical puzzlement arises from structural tension --- multiple potential universal properties competing without resolution --- and that therapy works by restructuring the category so that the tension is resolved.\n\n### Wittgenstein's Therapeutic Conception\n\nFor Wittgenstein, philosophical problems arise from linguistic confusions: \"philosophical problems arise when language goes on holiday\" (PI section 38). Therapy consists in \"assembling reminders for a particular purpose\" (PI section 127) --- drawing attention to how words are actually used so that the confused philosopher can see that there was no genuine problem.\n\n### The Tension\n\nThe author's account **explains** why therapy works; Wittgenstein would regard such an explanation as itself a philosophical confusion. Wittgenstein explicitly rejects the idea that philosophy should produce theories (PI section 109: \"we may not advance any kind of theory\"). For Wittgenstein, the therapeutic effect is self-evident once the confusion is cleared; there is nothing further to explain.\n\nHowever, the author's account does something that Wittgenstein's does not: it provides a **positive criterion** for when philosophical puzzlement should arise and when it should be resolved. By identifying puzzlement with categorical tension, the author can (in principle) predict which conceptual configurations will produce confusion and which will not. This is a genuinely productive extension, even if it violates Wittgenstein's quietism.\n\nFurthermore, the author's framework offers an interesting **bridge** between Wittgenstein's therapeutic approach and more constructive philosophical programs. If therapy works by resolving categorical tension, then constructive philosophy (building new frameworks, new concepts) is *also* a form of therapy --- it resolves tension not by showing that the question was confused, but by providing new categorical structure in which the tension can be resolved. This is close to what the author describes as the construction of 境.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Rule-Following and 恒常 (Constancy)\n\n### The Author's Account of Stable Structures\n\nThe concept of 恒常 (constancy) is introduced in 后形而上学 整理 as the core of metaphysical thinking:\n\n> \"形而上的核心是恒常。我们需要在变化的现象之中寻找到（追求）一种恒常性\"\n\nIn K1策略, this is formalized as stable structures $S_E$ preserved under the evolution functor $T$. The idea is that certain structural features of experience are invariant under experiential evolution --- they are the \"rules\" that constrain how experience can develop.\n\n### Wittgenstein's Rule-Following\n\nWittgenstein's rule-following considerations (PI sections 138--242) constitute one of the most profound and difficult passages in 20th-century philosophy. The central problem is: what constitutes following a rule? Wittgenstein argues against any **mentalist** or **Platonist** account of rules. A rule is not a mental state that determines its applications, nor is it an abstract object that we grasp. Rather, rule-following is a *practice* --- it consists in the regularity of a community's behavior, and there is no deeper fact that makes the behavior count as following *this* rule rather than *that* one.\n\nThe Kripkenstein paradox (Kripke's reading of Wittgenstein) sharpens this: for any finite sequence of applications, there are infinitely many rules consistent with that sequence. What determines that we are following addition rather than \"quaddition\"?\n\n### Comparison\n\nThe author's formalization of constancy as functorial invariance is in tension with Wittgenstein's anti-formalism in several ways:\n\n1. **Formalization vs. practice**: The author treats rules as mathematical invariants ($S_E$ preserved under $T$); Wittgenstein insists that rules are constituted by practice, not by any formal structure.\n\n2. **Community vs. individual**: Wittgenstein's rule-following requires a community of practitioners; the author's framework is largely individualistic (analyzing the evolution of a single person's $\\mathbb{E}_t$).\n\n3. **Determinacy**: The author's $S_E$ is (in principle) mathematically determinate; Wittgenstein argues that there is no fact of the matter about which rule is being followed apart from practice.\n\nHowever, the author's framework also has **surprising resonances** with Wittgenstein:\n\n1. **No ground-level rules**: The author explicitly states that $S_E$ is descriptive, not constitutive. The stable structures are observed regularities, not prescriptive rules. This is actually close to Wittgenstein's point: the \"rule\" is what we observe in practice, not a Platonic entity.\n\n2. **Non-uniqueness**: The author acknowledges that different choices of sub-categories and different time-ranges will yield different $S_E$. This echoes Wittgenstein's point that rule-following is context-dependent and community-relative.\n\n3. **The role of agreement**: When the author discusses philosophical experiments and the possibility of evoking shared experiences across different people, the criterion of success is structural agreement --- \"只需要他们具有相同的结构性位置.\" This is remarkably close to Wittgenstein's emphasis on \"agreement in form of life\" (PI section 241) as the basis for following the same rule.\n\n**Assessment**: The author formalizes what Wittgenstein deliberately left un-formalized. Whether this is a productive move or a misunderstanding depends on one's reading of Wittgenstein. On a therapeutic reading, it is a confusion. On a constructive reading (closer to Brandom or McDowell), it is a legitimate extension that preserves the anti-Platonist and practice-oriented spirit while adding mathematical precision.\n\n---\n\n## 6. On Certainty and the Knowledge Essay\n\n### The Author's Argument\n\nIn \"A Thought on Knowledge,\" the author argues that knowledge reduces to belief by analyzing each component of the traditional justified true belief (JTB) definition:\n\n1. **Truth condition**: methodologically impossible --- we have access only to phenomena, never to truth directly.\n2. **Justification condition**: all justification ultimately rests on phenomena or beliefs; phenomena must be \"digested\" into beliefs to be used; therefore justification is ultimately belief about belief.\n3. **Conclusion**: knowledge is, in practice, \"what each individual believes to be correct.\"\n\n### Wittgenstein's On Certainty\n\n*On Certainty* (OC), written in the last months of Wittgenstein's life, addresses Moore's \"proof of the external world.\" Wittgenstein argues that certain propositions function not as items of knowledge but as **hinge propositions** --- they are the framework within which knowledge claims, doubts, and justifications operate. \"The questions that we raise and our doubts depend on the fact that some propositions are exempt from doubt, as it were like hinges on which those turn\" (OC section 341).\n\nKey features of hinge propositions:\n- They are not known in the traditional sense; they are the **conditions** for knowing (OC section 403).\n- They cannot be justified, but this does not make them arbitrary (OC section 559).\n- They belong to a \"system\" or \"world-picture\" (*Weltbild*) (OC section 162).\n- They can change over time as practices change (OC section 96).\n\n### Connection\n\nThe author's analysis and Wittgenstein's *On Certainty* arrive at strikingly similar conclusions through different routes:\n\n1. **Foundationalism fails**: The author shows that justification bottoms out in unjustified belief or circular justification. Wittgenstein shows that justification bottoms out in hinge propositions that are not themselves justified.\n\n2. **Practice over theory**: The author repeatedly emphasizes \"in practice\" (在实践中) --- what people actually do when they claim to know something. Wittgenstein similarly focuses on what Moore *actually does* when he says \"I know this is a hand.\"\n\n3. **Knowledge as communal standard**: The author proposes that knowledge is \"what most people in a field believe to be correct.\" Wittgenstein's world-picture is similarly communal and practice-embedded.\n\n4. **Historical contingency**: The author notes that knowledge \"changes over time (e.g., geocentrism).\" Wittgenstein explicitly allows that hinge propositions can shift (OC section 96--99).\n\nHowever, there is a significant difference. Wittgenstein would resist the reduction of knowledge to belief. For Wittgenstein, hinge propositions are **neither** known **nor** believed --- they are the framework within which the distinction between knowledge and belief operates. The author's move is more radical: dissolving the knowledge/belief distinction entirely. This is closer to **pragmatism** (James, Dewey, Rorty) than to Wittgenstein, who preserves the grammar of \"knowing\" and \"believing\" even as he transforms their philosophical significance.\n\nThe author's analysis of scientific knowledge through the lens of high-energy physics (where \"fundamental particles\" are never directly observed, only electromagnetic signals in detectors that are then reconstructed through models) is particularly compelling and parallels Wittgenstein's observation in OC section 105: \"All testing, all confirmation and disconfirmation of a hypothesis takes place already within a system.\"\n\n---\n\n## 7. Private Language and Intersubjectivity\n\n### The Author's Position\n\nAcross the essays, the author repeatedly argues that we cannot access others' inner states:\n\n> \"人类不仅永远无法真正知道其他人的真实想法\" (关于集体利益)\n\n> \"我无法真正感受到他人的内心感受\" (后形而上学 整理)\n\nYet the author proposes a criterion for communication and intersubjective verification:\n\n> \"我们不需要本体论的验证不同的人获得了'同一'体验（例如Qualia），只需要他们具有相同的结构性位置\" (K1策略)\n\n### Wittgenstein's Private Language Argument\n\nWittgenstein's private language argument (PI sections 243--315) argues that a language whose terms refer to the speaker's private sensations, knowable only to the speaker, is impossible. The key moves:\n\n1. A private linguist cannot establish a criterion of correctness for their sensation-terms (PI section 258).\n2. Without such a criterion, there is no distinction between following a rule and merely thinking one is following a rule (PI section 202).\n3. Therefore, the meaning of sensation-terms must be grounded in public, shared practices.\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe author's position is **deeply compatible** with the private language argument, perhaps more than the author realizes. Consider:\n\n1. **Structural position as public criterion**: The author's proposal that shared experience is verified by \"structural position\" rather than by qualitative identity is exactly the kind of **public criterion** that Wittgenstein argues sensation-terms must have. We don't need to verify that your red *feels* the same as my red; we need only verify that \"red\" occupies the same structural position in both our linguistic/experiential networks.\n\n2. **Rejection of private access**: The author's insistence that we cannot know others' inner states, combined with the claim that structural verification suffices for communication, mirrors Wittgenstein's point that the \"private object\" drops out as irrelevant to meaning (PI section 293, the \"beetle in the box\" passage).\n\n3. **Category-theoretic formalization**: The author's framework provides a precise mathematical formulation of what \"same structural position\" means: isomorphic placement within a categorical structure. This goes beyond what Wittgenstein offers but is entirely consistent with his philosophical conclusions.\n\nWhere the author diverges from Wittgenstein is in maintaining that there genuinely *are* inner states that we cannot access --- the framework preserves subjective experience as ontologically real even if epistemically inaccessible. Wittgenstein, by contrast, argues that the very picture of \"inner states\" that others cannot access is confused: \"The essential thing about private experience is really not that each person possesses his own exemplar, but that nobody knows whether other people also have this or something else\" (PI section 272). For Wittgenstein, this \"not knowing\" is not an epistemic limitation but a grammatical observation --- the concept of \"knowing another's sensation\" has no clear application.\n\n**Assessment**: The author's structural verification criterion is one of the most philosophically productive ideas in the collection, and it can be read as a **constructive implementation** of Wittgenstein's insight that meaning is public. The category-theoretic apparatus provides precisely the tools needed to make \"same structural position\" rigorous. For the full account of how the natural transformation $\\eta$ serves as the mechanism of intersubjective verification --- and how the naturality condition itself functions as the public criterion, giving mathematical content to the beetle-in-the-box insight --- see Supplementary Section S1 below.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Forms of Life and 境/梦境\n\n### Wittgenstein's Forms of Life (Lebensformen)\n\n\"Forms of life\" is one of the most evocative and under-determined concepts in Wittgenstein. It appears only a handful of times in the *Investigations* (PI sections 19, 23, 241; PI p. 226). Its precise meaning is debated, but the central idea is that language games are embedded in broader patterns of human activity, behavior, and agreement. \"To imagine a language means to imagine a form of life\" (PI section 19).\n\nForms of life are:\n- **Not reducible to rules or structures**: they include the \"weave of life\" --- behaviors, reactions, training, natural history.\n- **The given**: \"What has to be accepted, the given, is --- so one could say --- forms of life\" (PI p. 226).\n- **Neither subjective nor objective**: they are the shared background against which subjectivity and objectivity make sense.\n\n### The Author's 境 and 梦境\n\nThe author's 境 ($\\mathbb{E}$) is defined as a categorical structure on phenomena ($\\mathfrak{P}$): experiences as objects, associations (联想) as morphisms, forming a tower structure. 梦境 is the \"environment\" in which meaning becomes possible --- the \"packaging\" of experience within which purposes and significance arise.\n\n### Comparison\n\nThere are genuine parallels:\n\n1. **Background for meaning**: Both forms of life and 境 serve as the background against which meaning, understanding, and purpose operate. Neither is itself an object of direct scrutiny --- both are the medium *in which* we think and act.\n\n2. **Given-ness**: The author's insistence that we cannot escape all 境 (\"抛弃所有的梦境即是不可能的\") parallels Wittgenstein's claim that forms of life are \"the given.\"\n\n3. **Multiplicity**: The author allows for multiple sub-categories ($\\mathcal{E}_L$, $\\mathcal{E}_M$, $\\mathcal{E}_K$) within $\\mathbb{E}$; Wittgenstein allows for multiple, overlapping forms of life.\n\nHowever, the differences are also significant:\n\n1. **Formalization**: 境 is explicitly formalized using category theory; Wittgenstein's forms of life are deliberately left informal. Wittgenstein would likely regard the formalization as a category mistake --- forms of life are not the kind of thing that *can* be formalized, because they include precisely those aspects of human activity that resist formalization.\n\n2. **Individualism vs. communalism**: 境 is fundamentally individual (each person has their own $\\mathbb{E}_t$); forms of life are fundamentally communal (they are shared patterns of activity). This is a deep philosophical difference. The author addresses intersubjectivity through structural correspondence, but the starting point is the individual subject.\n\n3. **Static vs. dynamic**: The author's 境 evolves ($T_t: \\mathbb{E}_t \\to \\mathbb{E}_{t+1}$); Wittgenstein's forms of life are relatively stable (they change historically but are not theorized as evolving).\n\n4. **Dreamscape metaphor**: 梦境 (dreamscape) --- particularly the distinction between 沉醉 (immersed/intoxicated) and 清醒 (lucid/awake) --- introduces an element of **self-awareness** that has no direct parallel in Wittgenstein. The idea of a \"lucid dream\" where one is fully invested yet fully aware of the constructed nature of the meaning-structure goes beyond Wittgenstein's framework. This is more reminiscent of Heidegger's distinction between authentic and inauthentic existence, or of the Buddhist concept of mindfulness within samsara.\n\n**Assessment**: 境 is best understood not as a formalization of Wittgenstein's forms of life, but as a **parallel concept** developed from different philosophical motivations. Forms of life are the communal background of meaning; 境 is the individual structural medium of experience. The two concepts address overlapping philosophical territory but from different starting points and with different emphases.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Translation Challenges\n\n### Key Terms with Wittgensteinian Resonance\n\nThe following terms require careful handling in translation due to their proximity to --- but divergence from --- established Wittgensteinian terminology:\n\n**语言游戏 (language games)**: The standard translation of Wittgenstein's *Sprachspiele* is \"language games.\" The author uses the same Chinese term but with a different emphasis: as a methodological tool for discovering stable structures rather than as the bedrock of meaning. Translators should use \"language games\" but add a note distinguishing the author's usage from Wittgenstein's. Consider: \"language games (in the methodological sense)\" on first occurrence, then simply \"language games\" thereafter.\n\n**哲学治疗 (philosophical therapy)**: This translates straightforwardly as \"philosophical therapy,\" which is the standard rendering of Wittgenstein's concept. But since the author gives it a structural explanation (resolution of categorical tension), a translator's note should clarify the difference.\n\n**结构 (structure)** and **意义 (meaning)**: These are the central terms in the structure/meaning question. \"Structure\" and \"meaning\" are straightforward, but the translator should be aware that the author's use of \"meaning\" is experiential/phenomenological rather than truth-conditional or referential.\n\n**理解 (understanding) vs. 掌握 (mastery/grasp)**: This distinction is philosophically crucial. The author defines 掌握 as the special case where $\\eta_a$ is the identity --- a \"direct confirmation sense\" without mediation. This corresponds to what Wittgenstein calls \"understanding\" in its most robust sense. I recommend translating 理解 as \"understanding\" and 掌握 as \"mastery\" or \"direct grasp,\" with a note explaining that the latter is a technical term in the author's framework corresponding to the identity natural transformation.\n\n**恒常 (constancy)**: This is the author's term for the invariance at the heart of metaphysics. \"Constancy\" is adequate but risks confusion with Husserl's \"constancy\" (*Bestandigkeit*). \"Invariance\" captures the mathematical sense better, but \"constancy\" preserves the more phenomenological register. I recommend \"constancy\" with a parenthetical \"(invariance)\" on first occurrence.\n\n**境**: See the full dictionary entry below. This is the most challenging term.\n\n**规则 (rules)**: Standard translation. But note that the author's \"rules\" are stable structures ($S_E$), not Wittgensteinian rule-following practices.\n\n### Critical Translation Implication: Experiential Sequence is Load-Bearing\n\nThe recognition that many passages in these essays function as **philosophical experiments** (see Supplementary Section S2 below) has a major implication for translation: **the experiential sequence of examples is load-bearing, not merely illustrative**. Translators must preserve the precise ordering, pacing, and experiential progression of the author's examples, because these sequences are designed to construct specific experiential structures in the reader.\n\nConcretely:\n\n1. **The Sisyphus -> office worker -> entrepreneur -> cat sequence** in 西西弗斯、班与猫 is a carefully staged dissolution. Each example builds on the previous one by modifying a single variable. Reordering, condensing, or abstracting this sequence would destroy the experiment --- the reader would not undergo the intended experiential progression from \"absurdity is inherent in repetition\" to \"absurdity is absent in intrinsically motivated repetition.\"\n\n2. **The 道德仁义礼 reversal** in 后形而上学 整理 requires the reader to first hold the traditional top-down ordering, then step-by-step experience its inversion. If a translator were to summarize this as \"the author argues that the traditional ordering is inverted,\" the philosophical experiment would be lost --- the reader would receive a proposition rather than undergoing an experiential restructuring.\n\n3. **The \"1+1=2\" and meme-sentence examples** in K1策略 require the reader to introspect in real time: first experiencing understanding (the $\\eta$ of \"1+1=2\"), then experiencing the *failure* of understanding (the meme sentence). Paraphrasing or footnoting these away would remove the experimental core.\n\n4. **The Ship of Theseus and \"what is a person?\" examples** in 范畴论与境 整理 are designed to evoke the universal property as a *felt experience*. The reader is supposed to notice the feeling itself, not just understand the proposition about it.\n\nThis means translators should treat these passages with the same care a literary translator gives to the pacing of a novel or the line breaks of a poem. The sequences are not decorative illustrations of abstract points; they are the philosophical argument itself, conducted in the register of experience. From a Wittgensteinian perspective, this is exactly right: for Wittgenstein, the examples *are* the philosophy (PI section 133), and any attempt to extract \"the point\" from the examples and present it abstractly is already a distortion.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Overall Significance\n\n### Does the Framework Achieve Something Wittgenstein Attempted?\n\nThe relationship between this framework and Wittgenstein's philosophy is best characterized as **complementary rather than duplicative**. Wittgenstein sought to dissolve philosophical problems by showing that they arise from linguistic confusions. The author seeks to **describe the structure of experience** in a way that makes philosophical problems tractable --- either dissolvable (by showing that they arise from categorical tension) or answerable (by mapping experiential structures through formal tools).\n\nThe deepest convergence is in the **anti-foundationalist** character of both projects:\n- Wittgenstein: there is no foundation beneath language games and forms of life; they are the given.\n- The author: there is no 第〇实在 (zeroth reality) accessible to us; phenomena are the 第一实在 (first reality), and all metaphysics is constructed *upon* phenomena.\n\nThe deepest divergence is in their attitudes toward **formalization**:\n- Wittgenstein: formalization is part of the disease, not the cure. Philosophical problems arise precisely from our attempt to force the richness of language use into formal molds.\n- The author: formalization (specifically, category theory) is a useful tool that, properly wielded, can illuminate the structure of experience without claiming to capture its essence.\n\n### Is the Category-Theoretic Formalization Productive?\n\nI believe it is, for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Natural transformations capture something real about understanding**. The idea that understanding is the alignment between structural evolution and experiential evolution, formalized as a natural transformation, is a genuinely illuminating philosophical proposal. It gives mathematical content to the vague notion of \"grasping\" meaning, and it does so in a way that is consistent with Wittgensteinian insights about the primacy of use and practice.\n\n2. **The structural verification criterion resolves a genuine problem**. Wittgenstein's private language argument establishes that meaning must be public, but it does not provide a positive account of *how* public meaning works. The author's structural position criterion fills this gap.\n\n3. **The framework is self-limiting**. The author repeatedly insists on the descriptive (rather than constitutive) character of the framework, and on the tool-like status of category theory. This self-limitation prevents the framework from falling into the kind of metaphysical dogmatism that Wittgenstein criticizes.\n\n4. **Connection to empirical verification**. The proposal for \"philosophical experiments\" --- constructing experiences with specific structural properties and verifying that they evoke the predicted experiential responses --- is a genuinely novel contribution to philosophical methodology. This goes beyond what Wittgenstein, the formal semanticists, or the speech act theorists have proposed.\n\nHowever, a Wittgensteinian critic would rightly note:\n- The framework may create new philosophical confusions even as it resolves old ones (e.g., reifying \"stable structures\" in experience).\n- The mathematical apparatus may obscure rather than illuminate for readers not trained in category theory.\n- The individualist starting point may miss the essentially communal character of meaning that Wittgenstein emphasizes.\n\n### Positioning in the Field\n\nWithin contemporary philosophy of language, this framework occupies a distinctive position:\n- It shares **inferentialism's** (Brandom) emphasis on structural relations over reference, but replaces inferential roles with categorical structures.\n- It shares **dynamic semantics'** emphasis on meaning as process, but operates at a more fundamental level (experience rather than discourse).\n- It shares **phenomenology's** (Husserl, Heidegger) emphasis on lived experience, but provides mathematical tools for structural analysis.\n- It inherits **Wittgenstein's** anti-foundationalism and emphasis on practice, but converts therapeutic insights into constructive resources.\n\nThe result is something genuinely new: a **structural phenomenology of meaning** that uses category theory as its formal backbone. Whether this will prove philosophically fruitful in the long run depends on whether the framework can generate specific, testable insights about the structure of understanding --- and the author's proposal for philosophical experiments suggests a path toward doing exactly that.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix: Notes on Individual Essays\n\n### 关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一\nFrom a philosophy of language perspective, the most interesting move here is the analogy between macro-level concepts (collective interest) and the renormalization group in physics. This parallels Wittgenstein's observation that concepts can operate at different \"levels\" without reducing to their micro-level constituents (cf. PI section 71 on family resemblance). The author's claim that \"人类不仅永远无法真正知道其他人的真实想法\" anticipates the private language considerations developed more fully in later essays.\n\n### A Thought on Knowledge\nThis essay is the most directly relevant to analytic epistemology and to *On Certainty*. The systematic stripping away of JTB components is clear and effective. The approach of focusing on \"how we access\" justification bases rather than \"what they are\" is thoroughly Wittgensteinian in spirit.\n\n### 西西弗斯、班与猫\nThe dissolution of absurdism through the concept of internally generated meaning (养猫) is philosophically elegant. From a Wittgensteinian perspective, the key insight is that meaning does not require articulation or justification --- the cat-owner does not need to state *why* cat care is meaningful. This resonates with Wittgenstein's observation that forms of life do not require external justification; they are the given. **This essay is itself a philosophical experiment** (see S2, Experiment 1): the Sisyphus -> worker -> entrepreneur -> cat sequence is a carefully staged experiential progression designed to dissolve absurdity in the reader's own experience. The translation must preserve the exact sequence and pacing.\n\n### 后形而上学 整理\nThe layered analysis of metaphysics (Types 0-3) and the \"inversion\" of 道德仁义礼 is sophisticated. The concept of 恒常 as the core of metaphysical thinking is a genuine contribution. The distinction between 第一实在 (phenomena) and 第二实在 (constructed reality) maps partially onto Wittgenstein's distinction between what is given and what is constructed in language, though the author's framework is more explicitly ontological. **The 道德仁义礼 reversal passage is itself a philosophical experiment** (see S2, Experiment 2): it does not merely *argue* that the traditional ordering is inverted but *performs* the inversion on the reader's experiential categories step by step. The translation must preserve the stepwise progression from 现象礼 through to 道, and the moment of explicit inversion (\"整个逻辑的顺序就被倒反过来\"), because the experiential \"flip\" is the philosophical content.\n\n### 形而上学后的目的：诗意\nThe distinction between 沉醉 (immersed) and 清醒 (lucid) dreamscapes is philosophically original. It offers a way of being meaning-engaged that is neither naive (pre-critical) nor nihilistic (post-critical). This has no direct Wittgensteinian parallel but is consistent with the later Wittgenstein's acceptance of forms of life as \"the given.\"\n\n### 范畴论与境 整理\nThis is where the formal apparatus is developed. The identification of associations (联想) with morphisms, and the tower structure of experience, are the framework's most technically innovative features. The examples (Ship of Theseus, \"what is a person?\", dragon's blood) effectively illustrate how the formal tools apply to traditional philosophical problems.\n\n### 范畴论与境：K1策略\nThis is the framework's culminating essay. The natural transformation analysis of understanding, the structural verification criterion, and the proposal for philosophical experiments are the most philosophically significant contributions. The explicit engagement with language games and philosophical therapy shows the author's awareness of the Wittgensteinian tradition.\n\n### 关于诗意和境的一些零散想法\nThis collection of notes extends and applies the framework. The self-referential observation that we are already constructing 境 in everyday life --- choosing clothes, decorating rooms, taking photographs --- grounds the abstract framework in lived practice, which is the most Wittgensteinian gesture in the entire collection.\n\n---\n\n## Supplementary Analysis: Two Follow-Up Topics\n\n### S1. Intersubjectivity via the Natural Transformation $\\eta$\n\nThe author suggests that the natural transformation $\\eta$ is the mechanism through which intersubjective verification is possible. Let me trace how this works and assess it from a Wittgensteinian perspective.\n\n#### The Mechanism\n\nConsider two people, Alice and Bob, both reading the sentence \"The cat jumped on the table\" (猫跳上了桌子). In K1策略, understanding this sentence requires a natural transformation between the sentence's structural evolution (its syntactic unfolding) and one's experiential evolution (the mental simulation of the event). If Alice has an $\\eta^A$ and Bob has an $\\eta^B$, the question of intersubjectivity becomes: do Alice and Bob understand the same thing?\n\nThe author's answer (K1策略 methodology point 3) is that we do not need ontological verification that $\\eta^A$ and $\\eta^B$ are qualitatively identical --- we need only that they occupy the same **structural position**. That is, if Alice's $\\eta^A$ relates the same objects and morphisms in the same way as Bob's $\\eta^B$, then their understanding is commensurable.\n\nMore precisely: the naturality condition requires that $\\eta$ commutes with all morphisms in the source category. This means $\\eta$ is not a free-floating subjective response but a **structurally constrained** response. Two people whose $\\eta$'s satisfy the same naturality diagrams are, in a rigorous mathematical sense, aligned --- even if the \"felt quality\" of their $\\eta$'s differs. The commutative diagram itself is the public, shareable criterion of understanding.\n\n#### Wittgensteinian Assessment\n\nThis is, I believe, the most philosophically significant move in the entire collection, and it represents a **genuine advance** on the intersubjectivity problem that goes beyond what Wittgenstein himself achieved. Here is why.\n\nWittgenstein's treatment of intersubjectivity operates on two levels:\n\n1. **The Private Language Argument (PI sections 243--315)**: Meaning must be public. The \"beetle in the box\" thought experiment (PI section 293) shows that if everyone has a box with something in it that only they can see, the \"something\" drops out of the language game --- what matters is the *role* of \"beetle\" in our shared practice, not its private content.\n\n2. **Agreement in Form of Life (PI section 241)**: \"So you are saying that human agreement decides what is true and what is false?\" --- \"It is what human beings *say* that is true and false; and they agree in the *language* they use. That is not agreement in opinions but in form of life.\"\n\nWittgenstein establishes that meaning is public and that intersubjective agreement is grounded in shared form of life. But he does not provide a **mechanism** for how this works. He would resist providing one, on therapeutic grounds --- the question \"how does intersubjective understanding work?\" is, for the quietist, already a confused question (understanding is not a process; cf. PI section 154).\n\nThe author's natural transformation framework provides what Wittgenstein deliberately withholds: a **positive structural account** of intersubjective alignment. The key insight is that **the naturality condition is itself the public criterion**. Consider:\n\n- The naturality square for $\\eta$ is a mathematical structure that can be checked, tested, and communicated.\n- Two people who both satisfy the naturality condition for the same source category are provably aligned in their structural responses.\n- This alignment does not require access to anyone's private experience --- it requires only that both people's responses are coherent with the same categorical structure.\n\nThis is precisely analogous to Wittgenstein's beetle-in-the-box: the private content ($\\eta^A$ vs $\\eta^B$ as felt experiences) drops out; what remains is the structural role ($\\eta$ as a natural transformation satisfying commutative diagrams). The author has given **mathematical content** to the beetle-in-the-box insight.\n\nFurthermore, the naturality condition addresses the **Kripkenstein problem** (Kripke's skeptical reading of Wittgenstein on rule-following). Kripke asks: what fact about me determines that I mean addition rather than \"quaddition\" by \"+\"? The author's framework suggests an answer: the fact that my $\\eta$ satisfies the naturality condition for the categorical structure of arithmetic. If my $\\eta$ is natural (commutes with all morphisms), then my understanding is structurally determined --- there is no room for quaddition-like deviance, because the naturality condition constrains $\\eta$ globally, not just at finitely many points. This is not Kripke's \"skeptical solution\" (meaning as community agreement) but something closer to a **structural solution**: meaning is fixed by the naturality constraint itself.\n\nHowever, a Wittgensteinian would raise the following concern: **who verifies the naturality condition?** If Alice checks whether Bob's $\\eta$ commutes with all morphisms, she must access Bob's $\\eta$ --- which is, by hypothesis, an experience in Bob's $\\mathbb{E}$. The author's response would presumably be the philosophical experiment methodology: construct situations designed to test whether specific components of $\\eta$ are present, and check for replicable behavioral responses. This converts the naturality check into an empirical procedure, which is consistent with Wittgenstein's emphasis on practice. But it also shows that **intersubjective verification is always partial and practical** --- we can check finitely many components of $\\eta$ through experiments, but we can never verify the full naturality condition. This partial, practical character is, I think, exactly right, and it is exactly what Wittgenstein would predict: agreement is always agreement in what we *do*, not in some metaphysical fact about shared understanding.\n\n**Key conclusion**: The natural transformation $\\eta$ provides a **structural criterion for intersubjective commensurability** that is (1) consistent with the private language argument's conclusion that meaning is public, (2) more specific than Wittgenstein's appeal to \"agreement in form of life,\" and (3) potentially testable through the philosophical experiment methodology. This is a genuine contribution to philosophy of language.\n\n#### Translation Note (Addendum to Dictionary)\n\nThe term 主体间性 should be translated as **intersubjectivity**. In the author's framework, intersubjectivity is not grounded in empathy, shared consciousness, or transcendental structures, but in **structural commensurability** --- the sharing of naturality conditions. This is distinct from Husserl's intersubjectivity (grounded in empathic appresentation), Habermas's (grounded in communicative rationality), and Wittgenstein's (grounded in agreement in form of life). The author's is perhaps closest to Brandom's inferentialism, where intersubjectivity is constituted by the mutual recognition of inferential commitments.\n\n---\n\n### S2. The Essays as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThe author proposes that \"philosophical experiments\" consist in constructing examples with specific structures to awaken specific experiences in readers, then checking whether those experiences are replicable (K1策略, methodology point 3). The author further suggests in \"写在最后\" that this practice is already ubiquitous: poetry, literature, art, music, games, memes, and even decorating one's room are all instances of constructing 境 to awaken experience.\n\nRe-reading the essays with this lens reveals that **several passages are indeed functioning as philosophical experiments** --- they are not merely *describing* philosophical positions but are actively *constructing* experiential structures in the reader. Let me identify the most significant instances.\n\n#### Experiment 1: The Sisyphus/Cat Essay as Dissolution of Absurdity\n\nThe essay 西西弗斯、班与猫 has a very specific argumentative structure that functions as a philosophical experiment:\n\n1. **Setup (establishing the target experience)**: The reader is invited to feel the absurdity of Sisyphus's situation, and then the absurdity of the office worker's situation. These are familiar scenarios; most readers will have a pre-existing $\\eta$ that connects \"repetitive labor\" with \"absurdity.\"\n\n2. **Pivot (disrupting the structural alignment)**: The author introduces the entrepreneur --- structurally identical labor, but no absurdity. This forces the reader to notice that their $\\eta$ between \"repetition\" and \"absurdity\" was not intrinsic but contingent on **alienation** (the meaning being external).\n\n3. **Dissolution (constructing a new $\\eta$)**: The cat example. Here the author constructs a scenario that is structurally identical to Sisyphus (repetitive, effortful, no cosmic purpose) but where the experience of absurdity is simply **absent**. The rhetorical force of this example depends on the reader *actually experiencing* the absence of absurdity when thinking about cat care. The sentence \"没有一个养猫的人会感到荒谬，荒谬从未来过\" is designed to trigger the reader's introspective verification: *Is this true? Do I feel absurdity when I think about caring for a cat?* The expected answer is no, and this no is itself the philosophical experiment's result.\n\nFrom a Wittgensteinian perspective, this is a paradigmatic example of **philosophical therapy conducted through examples** --- exactly what Wittgenstein does in the *Investigations*. Consider PI section 66, where Wittgenstein asks the reader to \"look and see\" whether there is something common to all games. The rhetorical structure is identical: Wittgenstein constructs a series of examples, invites the reader to introspect, and expects a specific experiential result (the *absence* of a common feature). The cat example works the same way: the author constructs a scenario, invites introspection, and expects the *absence* of absurdity.\n\nWhat makes this a philosophical *experiment* rather than merely a philosophical *argument* is that **the reader's introspective response is the evidence**. If the reader *does* feel absurdity when thinking about cat care, the experiment has failed for that reader, and the philosophical claim is not established. The claim is empirical-experiential, not logically necessary.\n\nThis is genuinely Wittgensteinian in method, even if the author's framework provides a more structural account of *why* the method works (the examples construct specific categorical structures that do or do not support a natural transformation involving \"absurdity\").\n\n#### Experiment 2: The 道德仁义礼 Reversal as Restructuring of the Reader's 境\n\nThe 道德仁义礼 passage in 后形而上学 整理 functions as a different kind of philosophical experiment --- one aimed at **restructuring** the reader's 境 rather than dissolving a specific feeling.\n\nThe passage proceeds in several steps:\n\n1. **The traditional ordering is presented**: 道 -> 德 -> 仁 -> 义 -> 礼. This is the familiar top-down metaphysical picture. Most readers educated in Chinese philosophy will have an existing $\\eta$ aligning this ordering with their understanding of the concepts.\n\n2. **The author introduces \"现象礼\"**: The reader is asked to recall the actual *experience* of ritual behavior --- how it feels, from the inside, to behave ritually toward others. This is a request for introspection.\n\n3. **The reversal is performed step by step**: 现象礼 -> 现象义 -> 现象仁 -> 德 -> 道. Each step is justified by appeal to the reader's own experience: \"this feeling is what you actually experience\" (切实感受到的). The reader is being guided through a reconstruction of their own experiential categories.\n\n4. **The inversion is made explicit**: \"整个逻辑的顺序就被倒反过来.\" The reader is invited to experience the *shift* --- the moment when the traditional ordering \"flips\" and the reader sees that what they took to be foundational (道) was actually derived (from 现象礼).\n\nFrom a Wittgensteinian perspective, this is a **perspicuous presentation** (*ubersichtliche Darstellung*, PI section 122) --- a rearrangement of what was already known that produces a new way of seeing. Wittgenstein's own method in the *Investigations* is precisely this: he does not introduce new facts but rearranges familiar facts so that we see them differently. The duck-rabbit (PI p. 194) is the iconic example: the same figure, seen differently.\n\nBut the 道德仁义礼 passage is more than a static perspicuous presentation --- it is a **guided restructuring** of the reader's experiential categories. The reader's $\\mathcal{E}$ is being actively reorganized: the meta-order of 道, 德, 仁, 义, 礼 is being inverted. If the experiment succeeds, the reader emerges with a different categorical structure --- one where phenomena are foundational and metaphysical concepts are derived. This is a restructuring of the reader's 境 itself.\n\nThis is something Wittgenstein does implicitly but never theorizes. The author, by providing the category-theoretic framework, can now describe *what happens* when a philosophical example restructures one's understanding: it changes the meta-ordering of objects in $\\mathcal{E}$, potentially changing which objects serve as universal properties, and thereby changing the reader's metaphysical commitments.\n\n#### Experiment 3: The \"1+1=2\" Passage as Evoking $\\eta$\n\nIn K1策略, the passage where the author asks the reader to introspect on the experience of understanding \"1+1=2\" is itself a philosophical experiment. The reader is asked:\n\n- Do you experience a \"direct confirmation sense\" when you see \"1+1=2\"?\n- Is this different from the experience of checking your answer against a reference?\n- Can you recognize the experience of $\\eta$ as identity (掌握) versus $\\eta$ as non-trivial (理解 without 掌握)?\n\nThe passage about the meme sentence \"你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国，记住我给出的原理\" is particularly effective: the reader is asked to notice the *failure* of $\\eta$ --- the experience of **not understanding** despite grammatical correctness. This negative result (the absence of alignment) is just as experimentally significant as the positive case.\n\n#### Experiment 4: The 忒修斯之船 (Ship of Theseus) as Evoking the Universal Property\n\nIn 范畴论与境 整理, the Ship of Theseus discussion asks the reader to introspect: \"When you think of the Ship of Theseus, what do you experience?\" The expected answer is a specific *feeling* --- the feeling that accompanies the concept of this particular ship, which is the universal property of the sub-category $\\mathcal{E}_{\\text{Theseus}}$. The author then shows that choosing $\\mathfrak{P}$ as the physical world leads to the paradox (the universal property becomes \"emptiness\"), while choosing $\\mathfrak{P}$ as phenomena resolves it (the universal property is the *feeling* of \"this ship\"). The reader is invited to verify this through introspection: \"Is the identity of the Ship of Theseus located in the physical planks or in my experience of the ship?\"\n\n#### Wittgensteinian Assessment of the Experimental Method\n\nWittgenstein would have a complex reaction to the philosophical experiment methodology:\n\n**What he would endorse**: The centrality of concrete examples, the appeal to introspective verification, the refusal to argue from abstract principles alone. These are all Wittgensteinian virtues. PI section 593: \"A main cause of philosophical disease --- a one-sided diet: one nourishes one's thinking with only one kind of example.\"\n\n**What he would resist**: The idea that introspective responses can be treated as *data* for a structural theory. For Wittgenstein, the examples are **self-sufficient** --- they do not serve a higher theoretical purpose. They are not evidence for a theory about natural transformations; they are the thing itself. The moment you treat introspective responses as data points in a structural theory, you have, from Wittgenstein's perspective, taken a step away from the phenomena and toward a philosophical construction.\n\n**What is genuinely new**: The author's key innovation is the claim that philosophical experiments can be designed *in advance* by specifying the categorical structure that should evoke the target experience. This is the reverse of Wittgenstein's method: Wittgenstein finds examples that dissolve existing confusions; the author proposes to *construct* examples that produce *specific predicted* experiences. This is a move from therapeutic philosophy to what we might call **constructive experimental phenomenology**. It has no precedent in Wittgenstein, though it has affinities with Austin's method of constructing specific speech-act scenarios to test linguistic intuitions. (Austin also believed that carefully constructed examples could serve as evidence for philosophical claims about language.)\n\n**The deepest insight**: The author's observation that the essays *themselves* are philosophical experiments --- not just descriptions of a theory but active interventions in the reader's experiential structure --- collapses the distinction between philosophical writing and philosophical practice. This is actually the most Wittgensteinian thing in the entire collection, because it embodies Wittgenstein's claim that philosophy is an *activity* (Tractatus 4.112), not a body of doctrine. The essays do not merely *say* that meaning is experiential alignment; they *show* it by constructing experiences in the reader. The medium is the message. This is philosophy as performance, as practice --- which is, in the end, what Wittgenstein always insisted philosophy should be.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":365,"oldLines":7,"newStart":365,"newLines":7,"lines":[" The distinction between 沉醉 (immersed) and 清醒 (lucid) dreamscapes is philosophically original.

Language Games in the Framework\n\n### The Author's Usage of 语言游戏 (Language Games)\n\nIn K1策略, the author explicitly invokes the concept of 语言游戏 (language games) as a method for investigating stable structures ($S_L$) within the linguistic sub-category $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$. The key passage states:\n\n> \"于是我们就可以通过语言游戏研究语言演化中的稳定结构 $S_L$，来间接获得对 $\\mathbb{E}_t$ 中 $S_E$ 的认识\"\n\nThis usage represents a **productive but significantly reoriented extension** of Wittgenstein's concept. In the *Philosophical Investigations*, language games serve multiple functions: they are simplified models of language use (PI section 2), they illustrate the multiplicity and heterogeneity of linguistic practices (PI section 23), and they are bound up with \"forms of life\" (PI section 23). Crucially, for Wittgenstein, language games are **not instruments for discovering underlying structures**. They are the thing itself --- the level at which meaning operates. There is no deeper structure that language games reveal; rather, language games *are* the bedrock.\n\nThe author, by contrast, treats language games as **probes** --- methodological instruments that, through the functor $(F_{E,L})_t$, can map linguistic stable structures onto experiential stable structures. This is closer to what we might call a **constructive-structuralist** appropriation of language games. Wittgenstein would likely resist this move, since for him the idea that language games reveal hidden invariants would itself be a philosophical confusion --- the very kind of theorizing he sought to dissolve.\n\nHowever, the author's framework is more subtle than a naive structuralism. The author acknowledges that the mapping $(F_{E,L})_t(S_L) \\approx S_E$ is only approximate, that it captures at best a partial overlap, and that the relationship is descriptive rather than constitutive. This qualification brings the author somewhat closer to Wittgenstein's therapeutic spirit: the framework does not claim to have found the *essence* of meaning, but rather offers a tool for mapping certain structural relationships.\n\n### Therapeutic vs. Constructive Conceptions\n\nWittgenstein's conception of philosophy is famously therapeutic: \"The philosopher treats a question; like an illness\" (PI section 255). The aim is not to construct theories but to dissolve confusions by achieving a \"perspicuous presentation\" (*ubersichtliche Darstellung*, PI section 122). PI section 133 states: \"The real discovery is the one that enables me to break off doing philosophy when I want to.\"\n\nThe author explicitly mentions 哲学治疗 (philosophical therapy) in K1策略 and claims that the framework explains why it works --- roughly, through the resolution of \"tension\" (张力) when experiential sub-categories lack a well-defined universal property. This is a **structural explanation of why therapy works**, which is itself a constructive philosophical move. Wittgenstein would not attempt to explain *why* therapy works in structural-mathematical terms; for him, the therapy works by showing us the way out of the fly-bottle (PI section 309), not by constructing a formal account of fly-bottles.\n\n**Assessment**: The author's use of language games is a **departure** from Wittgenstein's anti-theoretical stance, but it is a **self-aware departure**. The author does not claim to be doing what Wittgenstein did; rather, the author uses Wittgenstein's concept as one input among many in a constructive framework. This is closer to how Robert Brandom appropriates Wittgenstein --- taking the insight about the primacy of practice and embedding it within a systematic philosophical project --- than to the quietist reading of Wittgenstein associated with Cora Diamond and James Conant.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Meaning and Structure: 是结构先于意义，还是意义先于结构？\n\n### The Author's Resolution via Natural Transformations\n\nIn K1策略, the author asks: does structure precede meaning, or meaning precede structure? The resolution is given through the natural transformation framework:\n\n> \"结构和意义之间的关系是自然变换：一句话能够被理解，他必须能够在心理过程的演化和结构的演化中达成如上所述的这种一致性感受$\\eta$\"\n\nThis is a striking move. The author refuses the dichotomy by arguing that structure and meaning are related by a **natural transformation** --- neither generates the other, but they must be **aligned**. Understanding ($\\eta$) is precisely the experience of this alignment.\n\n### Relation to Wittgenstein's Meaning-as-Use\n\nWittgenstein's meaning-as-use thesis (PI section 43: \"the meaning of a word is its use in the language\") dissolves the structure/meaning dichotomy from a different direction. For Wittgenstein, there is no pre-linguistic meaning that structure then encodes, nor is there a pure structure that then generates meaning. Meaning simply *is* the pattern of use within a language game embedded in a form of life.\n\nThe author's framework can be read as a **formalization of why Wittgenstein's dissolution works**. If structure and meaning are related by natural transformation rather than by generation, then asking which comes first is indeed a confused question --- just as Wittgenstein suggests. The natural transformation framework gives mathematical content to the Wittgensteinian insight that meaning and use are co-constitutive.\n\nHowever, there is a crucial difference. For Wittgenstein, meaning-as-use is meant to *stop* philosophical theorizing about meaning. The point is that once we see that meaning is use, there is nothing further to explain. The author, by contrast, uses the dissolution of the dichotomy as a *starting point* for further structural analysis. This is characteristic of the author's general approach: taking Wittgensteinian therapeutic insights and converting them into constructive theoretical resources.\n\n### Contrast with Formal Semantics\n\nIn truth-conditional formal semantics (Montague, Davidson, Tarski), meaning is identified with truth-conditions, and structure (syntactic/logical form) determines meaning via compositional rules. This is a clear \"structure precedes meaning\" position. The author's framework differs from this in several ways:\n\n1. **No appeal to truth**: The author's framework, consistent with the Knowledge essay, does not invoke truth-conditions. Meaning is experiential alignment ($\\eta$), not truth-value assignment.\n2. **Bidirectionality**: Formal semantics maps structure to meaning; the author's natural transformation allows influence in both directions.\n3. **Dynamic character**: Formal semantics is typically static (a sentence has its meaning at a time); the author's framework is inherently evolutionary ($t \\to t+1$).\n\nThe author's position has more in common with **dynamic semantics** (Kamp, Heim, Groenendijk & Stokhof) and with **inferentialist semantics** (Brandom), where meaning is constituted by inferential role and responsive to context, than with classical Montague grammar.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The Picture Theory and Natural Transformations\n\n### Tractatus Picture Theory\n\nThe early Wittgenstein's picture theory (Tractatus 2.1--2.225) posits that propositions are pictures of reality. A picture shares \"logical form\" with what it depicts (T 2.18). The picture \"reaches up to reality\" (T 2.1511) through a structural isomorphism between the elements of the picture and the elements of the state of affairs.\n\n### The Author's Natural Transformation Framework\n\nThe author's framework posits that understanding occurs when the evolution of a formal structure (e.g., mathematics, language) and the evolution of experience are related by a natural transformation. The $\\eta_a$ component measures the alignment between two paths from structure to experience.\n\n### Comparison\n\nThere is a **genuine structural parallel**. Both frameworks posit that the relationship between language/formalism and reality/experience is mediated by **structural correspondence**. However, the differences are substantial:\n\n| Feature | Tractatus Picture Theory | Author's Framework |\n|---|---|---|\n| Correspondence type | Isomorphism (static) | Natural transformation (dynamic) |\n| What corresponds | Proposition and state of affairs | Structural evolution and experiential evolution |\n| Nature of correspondence | Logical form shared | Alignment ($\\eta$) experienced |\n| Status of correspondence | Metaphysical necessity | Empirical/experiential claim |\n| Directionality | One-way (picture depicts) | Bidirectional (natural transformation) |\n\nThe author's framework can be read as a **category-theoretic generalization** of the picture theory in the following precise sense: where the Tractatus requires a *single* structural isomorphism between a proposition and a fact, the author requires a *family* of morphisms ($\\eta_a$) that are *natural* (coherent across all objects and morphisms). The naturality condition is the key upgrade --- it captures not just point-by-point correspondence but **systematic coherence** across the entire categorical structure.\n\nMoreover, the author's framework **inherits the later Wittgenstein's corrections** to the picture theory. The Tractatus picture theory fails because it cannot account for the diversity of language uses (commands, jokes, prayers, greetings --- none of which \"picture\" anything). The author's framework avoids this by making the relevant correspondence *experiential* rather than *representational*. Understanding a joke is having the right $\\eta$ between the joke's structural unfolding and one's experiential response --- no picturing required.\n\n**Assessment**: The author's framework is best understood not as a generalization of the picture theory *per se*, but as a framework that **subsumes both** the picture theory (as a special case where $\\eta$ is an isomorphism) and the later Wittgenstein's meaning-as-use (as the general case where $\\eta$ captures experiential alignment).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Philosophical Therapy (哲学治疗)\n\n### The Author's Account\n\nIn K1策略, the author provides a structural account of why philosophical therapy works, centered on the concept of 张力 (tension) --- the state where a sub-category lacks a well-defined universal property, so that experience cannot resolve into a stable terminal point:\n\n> \"这也是哲学治疗为什么有效的原因\"\n\nThe author connects this to the idea that philosophical puzzlement arises from structural tension --- multiple potential universal properties competing without resolution --- and that therapy works by restructuring the category so that the tension is resolved.\n\n### Wittgenstein's Therapeutic Conception\n\nFor Wittgenstein, philosophical problems arise from linguistic confusions: \"philosophical problems arise when language goes on holiday\" (PI section 38). Therapy consists in \"assembling reminders for a particular purpose\" (PI section 127) --- drawing attention to how words are actually used so that the confused philosopher can see that there was no genuine problem.\n\n### The Tension\n\nThe author's account **explains** why therapy works; Wittgenstein would regard such an explanation as itself a philosophical confusion. Wittgenstein explicitly rejects the idea that philosophy should produce theories (PI section 109: \"we may not advance any kind of theory\"). For Wittgenstein, the therapeutic effect is self-evident once the confusion is cleared; there is nothing further to explain.\n\nHowever, the author's account does something that Wittgenstein's does not: it provides a **positive criterion** for when philosophical puzzlement should arise and when it should be resolved. By identifying puzzlement with categorical tension, the author can (in principle) predict which conceptual configurations will produce confusion and which will not. This is a genuinely productive extension, even if it violates Wittgenstein's quietism.\n\nFurthermore, the author's framework offers an interesting **bridge** between Wittgenstein's therapeutic approach and more constructive philosophical programs. If therapy works by resolving categorical tension, then constructive philosophy (building new frameworks, new concepts) is *also* a form of therapy --- it resolves tension not by showing that the question was confused, but by providing new categorical structure in which the tension can be resolved. This is close to what the author describes as the construction of 境.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Rule-Following and 恒常 (Constancy)\n\n### The Author's Account of Stable Structures\n\nThe concept of 恒常 (constancy) is introduced in 后形而上学 整理 as the core of metaphysical thinking:\n\n> \"形而上的核心是恒常。我们需要在变化的现象之中寻找到（追求）一种恒常性\"\n\nIn K1策略, this is formalized as stable structures $S_E$ preserved under the evolution functor $T$. The idea is that certain structural features of experience are invariant under experiential evolution --- they are the \"rules\" that constrain how experience can develop.\n\n### Wittgenstein's Rule-Following\n\nWittgenstein's rule-following considerations (PI sections 138--242) constitute one of the most profound and difficult passages in 20th-century philosophy. The central problem is: what constitutes following a rule? Wittgenstein argues against any **mentalist** or **Platonist** account of rules. A rule is not a mental state that determines its applications, nor is it an abstract object that we grasp. Rather, rule-following is a *practice* --- it consists in the regularity of a community's behavior, and there is no deeper fact that makes the behavior count as following *this* rule rather than *that* one.\n\nThe Kripkenstein paradox (Kripke's reading of Wittgenstein) sharpens this: for any finite sequence of applications, there are infinitely many rules consistent with that sequence. What determines that we are following addition rather than \"quaddition\"?\n\n### Comparison\n\nThe author's formalization of constancy as functorial invariance is in tension with Wittgenstein's anti-formalism in several ways:\n\n1. **Formalization vs. practice**: The author treats rules as mathematical invariants ($S_E$ preserved under $T$); Wittgenstein insists that rules are constituted by practice, not by any formal structure.\n\n2. **Community vs. individual**: Wittgenstein's rule-following requires a community of practitioners; the author's framework is largely individualistic (analyzing the evolution of a single person's $\\mathbb{E}_t$).\n\n3. **Determinacy**: The author's $S_E$ is (in principle) mathematically determinate; Wittgenstein argues that there is no fact of the matter about which rule is being followed apart from practice.\n\nHowever, the author's framework also has **surprising resonances** with Wittgenstein:\n\n1. **No ground-level rules**: The author explicitly states that $S_E$ is descriptive, not constitutive. The stable structures are observed regularities, not prescriptive rules. This is actually close to Wittgenstein's point: the \"rule\" is what we observe in practice, not a Platonic entity.\n\n2. **Non-uniqueness**: The author acknowledges that different choices of sub-categories and different time-ranges will yield different $S_E$. This echoes Wittgenstein's point that rule-following is context-dependent and community-relative.\n\n3. **The role of agreement**: When the author discusses philosophical experiments and the possibility of evoking shared experiences across different people, the criterion of success is structural agreement --- \"只需要他们具有相同的结构性位置.\" This is remarkably close to Wittgenstein's emphasis on \"agreement in form of life\" (PI section 241) as the basis for following the same rule.\n\n**Assessment**: The author formalizes what Wittgenstein deliberately left un-formalized. Whether this is a productive move or a misunderstanding depends on one's reading of Wittgenstein. On a therapeutic reading, it is a confusion. On a constructive reading (closer to Brandom or McDowell), it is a legitimate extension that preserves the anti-Platonist and practice-oriented spirit while adding mathematical precision.\n\n---\n\n## 6. On Certainty and the Knowledge Essay\n\n### The Author's Argument\n\nIn \"A Thought on Knowledge,\" the author argues that knowledge reduces to belief by analyzing each component of the traditional justified true belief (JTB) definition:\n\n1. **Truth condition**: methodologically impossible --- we have access only to phenomena, never to truth directly.\n2. **Justification condition**: all justification ultimately rests on phenomena or beliefs; phenomena must be \"digested\" into beliefs to be used; therefore justification is ultimately belief about belief.\n3. **Conclusion**: knowledge is, in practice, \"what each individual believes to be correct.\"\n\n### Wittgenstein's On Certainty\n\n*On Certainty* (OC), written in the last months of Wittgenstein's life, addresses Moore's \"proof of the external world.\" Wittgenstein argues that certain propositions function not as items of knowledge but as **hinge propositions** --- they are the framework within which knowledge claims, doubts, and justifications operate. \"The questions that we raise and our doubts depend on the fact that some propositions are exempt from doubt, as it were like hinges on which those turn\" (OC section 341).\n\nKey features of hinge propositions:\n- They are not known in the traditional sense; they are the **conditions** for knowing (OC section 403).\n- They cannot be justified, but this does not make them arbitrary (OC section 559).\n- They belong to a \"system\" or \"world-picture\" (*Weltbild*) (OC section 162).\n- They can change over time as practices change (OC section 96).\n\n### Connection\n\nThe author's analysis and Wittgenstein's *On Certainty* arrive at strikingly similar conclusions through different routes:\n\n1. **Foundationalism fails**: The author shows that justification bottoms out in unjustified belief or circular justification. Wittgenstein shows that justification bottoms out in hinge propositions that are not themselves justified.\n\n2. **Practice over theory**: The author repeatedly emphasizes \"in practice\" (在实践中) --- what people actually do when they claim to know something. Wittgenstein similarly focuses on what Moore *actually does* when he says \"I know this is a hand.\"\n\n3. **Knowledge as communal standard**: The author proposes that knowledge is \"what most people in a field believe to be correct.\" Wittgenstein's world-picture is similarly communal and practice-embedded.\n\n4. **Historical contingency**: The author notes that knowledge \"changes over time (e.g., geocentrism).\" Wittgenstein explicitly allows that hinge propositions can shift (OC section 96--99).\n\nHowever, there is a significant difference. Wittgenstein would resist the reduction of knowledge to belief. For Wittgenstein, hinge propositions are **neither** known **nor** believed --- they are the framework within which the distinction between knowledge and belief operates. The author's move is more radical: dissolving the knowledge/belief distinction entirely. This is closer to **pragmatism** (James, Dewey, Rorty) than to Wittgenstein, who preserves the grammar of \"knowing\" and \"believing\" even as he transforms their philosophical significance.\n\nThe author's analysis of scientific knowledge through the lens of high-energy physics (where \"fundamental particles\" are never directly observed, only electromagnetic signals in detectors that are then reconstructed through models) is particularly compelling and parallels Wittgenstein's observation in OC section 105: \"All testing, all confirmation and disconfirmation of a hypothesis takes place already within a system.\"\n\n---\n\n## 7. Private Language and Intersubjectivity\n\n### The Author's Position\n\nAcross the essays, the author repeatedly argues that we cannot access others' inner states:\n\n> \"人类不仅永远无法真正知道其他人的真实想法\" (关于集体利益)\n\n> \"我无法真正感受到他人的内心感受\" (后形而上学 整理)\n\nYet the author proposes a criterion for communication and intersubjective verification:\n\n> \"我们不需要本体论的验证不同的人获得了'同一'体验（例如Qualia），只需要他们具有相同的结构性位置\" (K1策略)\n\n### Wittgenstein's Private Language Argument\n\nWittgenstein's private language argument (PI sections 243--315) argues that a language whose terms refer to the speaker's private sensations, knowable only to the speaker, is impossible. The key moves:\n\n1. A private linguist cannot establish a criterion of correctness for their sensation-terms (PI section 258).\n2. Without such a criterion, there is no distinction between following a rule and merely thinking one is following a rule (PI section 202).\n3. Therefore, the meaning of sensation-terms must be grounded in public, shared practices.\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe author's position is **deeply compatible** with the private language argument, perhaps more than the author realizes. Consider:\n\n1. **Structural position as public criterion**: The author's proposal that shared experience is verified by \"structural position\" rather than by qualitative identity is exactly the kind of **public criterion** that Wittgenstein argues sensation-terms must have. We don't need to verify that your red *feels* the same as my red; we need only verify that \"red\" occupies the same structural position in both our linguistic/experiential networks.\n\n2. **Rejection of private access**: The author's insistence that we cannot know others' inner states, combined with the claim that structural verification suffices for communication, mirrors Wittgenstein's point that the \"private object\" drops out as irrelevant to meaning (PI section 293, the \"beetle in the box\" passage).\n\n3. **Category-theoretic formalization**: The author's framework provides a precise mathematical formulation of what \"same structural position\" means: isomorphic placement within a categorical structure. This goes beyond what Wittgenstein offers but is entirely consistent with his philosophical conclusions.\n\nWhere the author diverges from Wittgenstein is in maintaining that there genuinely *are* inner states that we cannot access --- the framework preserves subjective experience as ontologically real even if epistemically inaccessible. Wittgenstein, by contrast, argues that the very picture of \"inner states\" that others cannot access is confused: \"The essential thing about private experience is really not that each person possesses his own exemplar, but that nobody knows whether other people also have this or something else\" (PI section 272). For Wittgenstein, this \"not knowing\" is not an epistemic limitation but a grammatical observation --- the concept of \"knowing another's sensation\" has no clear application.\n\n**Assessment**: The author's structural verification criterion is one of the most philosophically productive ideas in the collection, and it can be read as a **constructive implementation** of Wittgenstein's insight that meaning is public. The category-theoretic apparatus provides precisely the tools needed to make \"same structural position\" rigorous. For the full account of how the natural transformation $\\eta$ serves as the mechanism of intersubjective verification --- and how the naturality condition itself functions as the public criterion, giving mathematical content to the beetle-in-the-box insight --- see Supplementary Section S1 below.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Forms of Life and 境/梦境\n\n### Wittgenstein's Forms of Life (Lebensformen)\n\n\"Forms of life\" is one of the most evocative and under-determined concepts in Wittgenstein. It appears only a handful of times in the *Investigations* (PI sections 19, 23, 241; PI p. 226). Its precise meaning is debated, but the central idea is that language games are embedded in broader patterns of human activity, behavior, and agreement. \"To imagine a language means to imagine a form of life\" (PI section 19).\n\nForms of life are:\n- **Not reducible to rules or structures**: they include the \"weave of life\" --- behaviors, reactions, training, natural history.\n- **The given**: \"What has to be accepted, the given, is --- so one could say --- forms of life\" (PI p. 226).\n- **Neither subjective nor objective**: they are the shared background against which subjectivity and objectivity make sense.\n\n### The Author's 境 and 梦境\n\nThe author's 境 ($\\mathbb{E}$) is defined as a categorical structure on phenomena ($\\mathfrak{P}$): experiences as objects, associations (联想) as morphisms, forming a tower structure. 梦境 is the \"environment\" in which meaning becomes possible --- the \"packaging\" of experience within which purposes and significance arise.\n\n### Comparison\n\nThere are genuine parallels:\n\n1. **Background for meaning**: Both forms of life and 境 serve as the background against which meaning, understanding, and purpose operate. Neither is itself an object of direct scrutiny --- both are the medium *in which* we think and act.\n\n2. **Given-ness**: The author's insistence that we cannot escape all 境 (\"抛弃所有的梦境即是不可能的\") parallels Wittgenstein's claim that forms of life are \"the given.\"\n\n3. **Multiplicity**: The author allows for multiple sub-categories ($\\mathcal{E}_L$, $\\mathcal{E}_M$, $\\mathcal{E}_K$) within $\\mathbb{E}$; Wittgenstein allows for multiple, overlapping forms of life.\n\nHowever, the differences are also significant:\n\n1. **Formalization**: 境 is explicitly formalized using category theory; Wittgenstein's forms of life are deliberately left informal. Wittgenstein would likely regard the formalization as a category mistake --- forms of life are not the kind of thing that *can* be formalized, because they include precisely those aspects of human activity that resist formalization.\n\n2. **Individualism vs. communalism**: 境 is fundamentally individual (each person has their own $\\mathbb{E}_t$); forms of life are fundamentally communal (they are shared patterns of activity). This is a deep philosophical difference. The author addresses intersubjectivity through structural correspondence, but the starting point is the individual subject.\n\n3. **Static vs. dynamic**: The author's 境 evolves ($T_t: \\mathbb{E}_t \\to \\mathbb{E}_{t+1}$); Wittgenstein's forms of life are relatively stable (they change historically but are not theorized as evolving).\n\n4. **Dreamscape metaphor**: 梦境 (dreamscape) --- particularly the distinction between 沉醉 (immersed/intoxicated) and 清醒 (lucid/awake) --- introduces an element of **self-awareness** that has no direct parallel in Wittgenstein. The idea of a \"lucid dream\" where one is fully invested yet fully aware of the constructed nature of the meaning-structure goes beyond Wittgenstein's framework. This is more reminiscent of Heidegger's distinction between authentic and inauthentic existence, or of the Buddhist concept of mindfulness within samsara.\n\n**Assessment**: 境 is best understood not as a formalization of Wittgenstein's forms of life, but as a **parallel concept** developed from different philosophical motivations. Forms of life are the communal background of meaning; 境 is the individual structural medium of experience. The two concepts address overlapping philosophical territory but from different starting points and with different emphases.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Translation Challenges\n\n### Key Terms with Wittgensteinian Resonance\n\nThe following terms require careful handling in translation due to their proximity to --- but divergence from --- established Wittgensteinian terminology:\n\n**语言游戏 (language games)**: The standard translation of Wittgenstein's *Sprachspiele* is \"language games.\" The author uses the same Chinese term but with a different emphasis: as a methodological tool for discovering stable structures rather than as the bedrock of meaning. Translators should use \"language games\" but add a note distinguishing the author's usage from Wittgenstein's. Consider: \"language games (in the methodological sense)\" on first occurrence, then simply \"language games\" thereafter.\n\n**哲学治疗 (philosophical therapy)**: This translates straightforwardly as \"philosophical therapy,\" which is the standard rendering of Wittgenstein's concept. But since the author gives it a structural explanation (resolution of categorical tension), a translator's note should clarify the difference.\n\n**结构 (structure)** and **意义 (meaning)**: These are the central terms in the structure/meaning question. \"Structure\" and \"meaning\" are straightforward, but the translator should be aware that the author's use of \"meaning\" is experiential/phenomenological rather than truth-conditional or referential.\n\n**理解 (understanding) vs. 掌握 (mastery/grasp)**: This distinction is philosophically crucial. The author defines 掌握 as the special case where $\\eta_a$ is the identity --- a \"direct confirmation sense\" without mediation. This corresponds to what Wittgenstein calls \"understanding\" in its most robust sense. I recommend translating 理解 as \"understanding\" and 掌握 as \"mastery\" or \"direct grasp,\" with a note explaining that the latter is a technical term in the author's framework corresponding to the identity natural transformation.\n\n**恒常 (constancy)**: This is the author's term for the invariance at the heart of metaphysics. \"Constancy\" is adequate but risks confusion with Husserl's \"constancy\" (*Bestandigkeit*). \"Invariance\" captures the mathematical sense better, but \"constancy\" preserves the more phenomenological register. I recommend \"constancy\" with a parenthetical \"(invariance)\" on first occurrence.\n\n**境**: See the full dictionary entry below. This is the most challenging term.\n\n**规则 (rules)**: Standard translation. But note that the author's \"rules\" are stable structures ($S_E$), not Wittgensteinian rule-following practices.\n\n### Critical Translation Implication: Experiential Sequence is Load-Bearing\n\nThe recognition that many passages in these essays function as **philosophical experiments** (see Supplementary Section S2 below) has a major implication for translation: **the experiential sequence of examples is load-bearing, not merely illustrative**. Translators must preserve the precise ordering, pacing, and experiential progression of the author's examples, because these sequences are designed to construct specific experiential structures in the reader.\n\nConcretely:\n\n1. **The Sisyphus -> office worker -> entrepreneur -> cat sequence** in 西西弗斯、班与猫 is a carefully staged dissolution. Each example builds on the previous one by modifying a single variable. Reordering, condensing, or abstracting this sequence would destroy the experiment --- the reader would not undergo the intended experiential progression from \"absurdity is inherent in repetition\" to \"absurdity is absent in intrinsically motivated repetition.\"\n\n2. **The 道德仁义礼 reversal** in 后形而上学 整理 requires the reader to first hold the traditional top-down ordering, then step-by-step experience its inversion. If a translator were to summarize this as \"the author argues that the traditional ordering is inverted,\" the philosophical experiment would be lost --- the reader would receive a proposition rather than undergoing an experiential restructuring.\n\n3. **The \"1+1=2\" and meme-sentence examples** in K1策略 require the reader to introspect in real time: first experiencing understanding (the $\\eta$ of \"1+1=2\"), then experiencing the *failure* of understanding (the meme sentence). Paraphrasing or footnoting these away would remove the experimental core.\n\n4. **The Ship of Theseus and \"what is a person?\" examples** in 范畴论与境 整理 are designed to evoke the universal property as a *felt experience*. The reader is supposed to notice the feeling itself, not just understand the proposition about it.\n\nThis means translators should treat these passages with the same care a literary translator gives to the pacing of a novel or the line breaks of a poem. The sequences are not decorative illustrations of abstract points; they are the philosophical argument itself, conducted in the register of experience. From a Wittgensteinian perspective, this is exactly right: for Wittgenstein, the examples *are* the philosophy (PI section 133), and any attempt to extract \"the point\" from the examples and present it abstractly is already a distortion.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Overall Significance\n\n### Does the Framework Achieve Something Wittgenstein Attempted?\n\nThe relationship between this framework and Wittgenstein's philosophy is best characterized as **complementary rather than duplicative**. Wittgenstein sought to dissolve philosophical problems by showing that they arise from linguistic confusions. The author seeks to **describe the structure of experience** in a way that makes philosophical problems tractable --- either dissolvable (by showing that they arise from categorical tension) or answerable (by mapping experiential structures through formal tools).\n\nThe deepest convergence is in the **anti-foundationalist** character of both projects:\n- Wittgenstein: there is no foundation beneath language games and forms of life; they are the given.\n- The author: there is no 第〇实在 (zeroth reality) accessible to us; phenomena are the 第一实在 (first reality), and all metaphysics is constructed *upon* phenomena.\n\nThe deepest divergence is in their attitudes toward **formalization**:\n- Wittgenstein: formalization is part of the disease, not the cure. Philosophical problems arise precisely from our attempt to force the richness of language use into formal molds.\n- The author: formalization (specifically, category theory) is a useful tool that, properly wielded, can illuminate the structure of experience without claiming to capture its essence.\n\n### Is the Category-Theoretic Formalization Productive?\n\nI believe it is, for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Natural transformations capture something real about understanding**. The idea that understanding is the alignment between structural evolution and experiential evolution, formalized as a natural transformation, is a genuinely illuminating philosophical proposal. It gives mathematical content to the vague notion of \"grasping\" meaning, and it does so in a way that is consistent with Wittgensteinian insights about the primacy of use and practice.\n\n2. **The structural verification criterion resolves a genuine problem**. Wittgenstein's private language argument establishes that meaning must be public, but it does not provide a positive account of *how* public meaning works. The author's structural position criterion fills this gap.\n\n3. **The framework is self-limiting**. The author repeatedly insists on the descriptive (rather than constitutive) character of the framework, and on the tool-like status of category theory. This self-limitation prevents the framework from falling into the kind of metaphysical dogmatism that Wittgenstein criticizes.\n\n4. **Connection to empirical verification**. The proposal for \"philosophical experiments\" --- constructing experiences with specific structural properties and verifying that they evoke the predicted experiential responses --- is a genuinely novel contribution to philosophical methodology. This goes beyond what Wittgenstein, the formal semanticists, or the speech act theorists have proposed.\n\nHowever, a Wittgensteinian critic would rightly note:\n- The framework may create new philosophical confusions even as it resolves old ones (e.g., reifying \"stable structures\" in experience).\n- The mathematical apparatus may obscure rather than illuminate for readers not trained in category theory.\n- The individualist starting point may miss the essentially communal character of meaning that Wittgenstein emphasizes.\n\n### Positioning in the Field\n\nWithin contemporary philosophy of language, this framework occupies a distinctive position:\n- It shares **inferentialism's** (Brandom) emphasis on structural relations over reference, but replaces inferential roles with categorical structures.\n- It shares **dynamic semantics'** emphasis on meaning as process, but operates at a more fundamental level (experience rather than discourse).\n- It shares **phenomenology's** (Husserl, Heidegger) emphasis on lived experience, but provides mathematical tools for structural analysis.\n- It inherits **Wittgenstein's** anti-foundationalism and emphasis on practice, but converts therapeutic insights into constructive resources.\n\nThe result is something genuinely new: a **structural phenomenology of meaning** that uses category theory as its formal backbone. Whether this will prove philosophically fruitful in the long run depends on whether the framework can generate specific, testable insights about the structure of understanding --- and the author's proposal for philosophical experiments suggests a path toward doing exactly that.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix: Notes on Individual Essays\n\n### 关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一\nFrom a philosophy of language perspective, the most interesting move here is the analogy between macro-level concepts (collective interest) and the renormalization group in physics. This parallels Wittgenstein's observation that concepts can operate at different \"levels\" without reducing to their micro-level constituents (cf. PI section 71 on family resemblance). The author's claim that \"人类不仅永远无法真正知道其他人的真实想法\" anticipates the private language considerations developed more fully in later essays.\n\n### A Thought on Knowledge\nThis essay is the most directly relevant to analytic epistemology and to *On Certainty*. The systematic stripping away of JTB components is clear and effective. The approach of focusing on \"how we access\" justification bases rather than \"what they are\" is thoroughly Wittgensteinian in spirit.\n\n### 西西弗斯、班与猫\nThe dissolution of absurdism through the concept of internally generated meaning (养猫) is philosophically elegant. From a Wittgensteinian perspective, the key insight is that meaning does not require articulation or justification --- the cat-owner does not need to state *why* cat care is meaningful. This resonates with Wittgenstein's observation that forms of life do not require external justification; they are the given. **This essay is itself a philosophical experiment** (see S2, Experiment 1): the Sisyphus -> worker -> entrepreneur -> cat sequence is a carefully staged experiential progression designed to dissolve absurdity in the reader's own experience. The translation must preserve the exact sequence and pacing.\n\n### 后形而上学 整理\nThe layered analysis of metaphysics (Types 0-3) and the \"inversion\" of 道德仁义礼 is sophisticated. The concept of 恒常 as the core of metaphysical thinking is a genuine contribution. The distinction between 第一实在 (phenomena) and 第二实在 (constructed reality) maps partially onto Wittgenstein's distinction between what is given and what is constructed in language, though the author's framework is more explicitly ontological. **The 道德仁义礼 reversal passage is itself a philosophical experiment** (see S2, Experiment 2): it does not merely *argue* that the traditional ordering is inverted but *performs* the inversion on the reader's experiential categories step by step. The translation must preserve the stepwise progression from 现象礼 through to 道, and the moment of explicit inversion (\"整个逻辑的顺序就被倒反过来\"), because the experiential \"flip\" is the philosophical content.\n\n### 形而上学后的目的：诗意\nThe distinction between 沉醉 (immersed) and 清醒 (lucid) dreamscapes is philosophically original. It offers a way of being meaning-engaged that is neither naive (pre-critical) nor nihilistic (post-critical). This has no direct Wittgensteinian parallel but is consistent with the later Wittgenstein's acceptance of forms of life as \"the given.\"\n\n### 范畴论与境 整理\nThis is where the formal apparatus is developed. The identification of associations (联想) with morphisms, and the tower structure of experience, are the framework's most technically innovative features. The examples (Ship of Theseus, \"what is a person?\", dragon's blood) are not merely illustrative --- **they function as philosophical experiments** (see S2, Experiment 4): they invite the reader to introspect and verify that \"what is X?\" resolves into a specific *felt experience* (the universal property). The dragon's blood example (龙血) is particularly effective as an experiment in meta-order relativity: the reader is asked to experience the same concept at different meta-orders depending on the narrative context, demonstrating that categorical structure is perspectival rather than absolute.\n\n### 范畴论与境：K1策略\nThis is the framework's culminating essay. The natural transformation analysis of understanding, the structural verification criterion, and the proposal for philosophical experiments are the most philosophically significant contributions. The explicit engagement with language games and philosophical therapy shows the author's awareness of the Wittgensteinian tradition.\n\n### 关于诗意和境的一些零散想法\nThis collection of notes extends and applies the framework. The self-referential observation that we are already constructing 境 in everyday life --- choosing clothes, decorating rooms, taking photographs --- grounds the abstract framework in lived practice, which is the most Wittgensteinian gesture in the entire collection.\n\n---\n\n## Supplementary Analysis: Two Follow-Up Topics\n\n### S1. Intersubjectivity via the Natural Transformation $\\eta$\n\nThe author suggests that the natural transformation $\\eta$ is the mechanism through which intersubjective verification is possible. Let me trace how this works and assess it from a Wittgensteinian perspective.\n\n#### The Mechanism\n\nConsider two people, Alice and Bob, both reading the sentence \"The cat jumped on the table\" (猫跳上了桌子). In K1策略, understanding this sentence requires a natural transformation between the sentence's structural evolution (its syntactic unfolding) and one's experiential evolution (the mental simulation of the event). If Alice has an $\\eta^A$ and Bob has an $\\eta^B$, the question of intersubjectivity becomes: do Alice and Bob understand the same thing?\n\nThe author's answer (K1策略 methodology point 3) is that we do not need ontological verification that $\\eta^A$ and $\\eta^B$ are qualitatively identical --- we need only that they occupy the same **structural position**. That is, if Alice's $\\eta^A$ relates the same objects and morphisms in the same way as Bob's $\\eta^B$, then their understanding is commensurable.\n\nMore precisely: the naturality condition requires that $\\eta$ commutes with all morphisms in the source category. This means $\\eta$ is not a free-floating subjective response but a **structurally constrained** response. Two people whose $\\eta$'s satisfy the same naturality diagrams are, in a rigorous mathematical sense, aligned --- even if the \"felt quality\" of their $\\eta$'s differs. The commutative diagram itself is the public, shareable criterion of understanding.\n\n#### Wittgensteinian Assessment\n\nThis is, I believe, the most philosophically significant move in the entire collection, and it represents a **genuine advance** on the intersubjectivity problem that goes beyond what Wittgenstein himself achieved. Here is why.\n\nWittgenstein's treatment of intersubjectivity operates on two levels:\n\n1. **The Private Language Argument (PI sections 243--315)**: Meaning must be public. The \"beetle in the box\" thought experiment (PI section 293) shows that if everyone has a box with something in it that only they can see, the \"something\" drops out of the language game --- what matters is the *role* of \"beetle\" in our shared practice, not its private content.\n\n2. **Agreement in Form of Life (PI section 241)**: \"So you are saying that human agreement decides what is true and what is false?\" --- \"It is what human beings *say* that is true and false; and they agree in the *language* they use. That is not agreement in opinions but in form of life.\"\n\nWittgenstein establishes that meaning is public and that intersubjective agreement is grounded in shared form of life. But he does not provide a **mechanism** for how this works. He would resist providing one, on therapeutic grounds --- the question \"how does intersubjective understanding work?\" is, for the quietist, already a confused question (understanding is not a process; cf. PI section 154).\n\nThe author's natural transformation framework provides what Wittgenstein deliberately withholds: a **positive structural account** of intersubjective alignment. The key insight is that **the naturality condition is itself the public criterion**. Consider:\n\n- The naturality square for $\\eta$ is a mathematical structure that can be checked, tested, and communicated.\n- Two people who both satisfy the naturality condition for the same source category are provably aligned in their structural responses.\n- This alignment does not require access to anyone's private experience --- it requires only that both people's responses are coherent with the same categorical structure.\n\nThis is precisely analogous to Wittgenstein's beetle-in-the-box: the private content ($\\eta^A$ vs $\\eta^B$ as felt experiences) drops out; what remains is the structural role ($\\eta$ as a natural transformation satisfying commutative diagrams). The author has given **mathematical content** to the beetle-in-the-box insight.\n\nFurthermore, the naturality condition addresses the **Kripkenstein problem** (Kripke's skeptical reading of Wittgenstein on rule-following). Kripke asks: what fact about me determines that I mean addition rather than \"quaddition\" by \"+\"? The author's framework suggests an answer: the fact that my $\\eta$ satisfies the naturality condition for the categorical structure of arithmetic. If my $\\eta$ is natural (commutes with all morphisms), then my understanding is structurally determined --- there is no room for quaddition-like deviance, because the naturality condition constrains $\\eta$ globally, not just at finitely many points. This is not Kripke's \"skeptical solution\" (meaning as community agreement) but something closer to a **structural solution**: meaning is fixed by the naturality constraint itself.\n\nHowever, a Wittgensteinian would raise the following concern: **who verifies the naturality condition?** If Alice checks whether Bob's $\\eta$ commutes with all morphisms, she must access Bob's $\\eta$ --- which is, by hypothesis, an experience in Bob's $\\mathbb{E}$. The author's response would presumably be the philosophical experiment methodology: construct situations designed to test whether specific components of $\\eta$ are present, and check for replicable behavioral responses. This converts the naturality check into an empirical procedure, which is consistent with Wittgenstein's emphasis on practice. But it also shows that **intersubjective verification is always partial and practical** --- we can check finitely many components of $\\eta$ through experiments, but we can never verify the full naturality condition. This partial, practical character is, I think, exactly right, and it is exactly what Wittgenstein would predict: agreement is always agreement in what we *do*, not in some metaphysical fact about shared understanding.\n\n**Key conclusion**: The natural transformation $\\eta$ provides a **structural criterion for intersubjective commensurability** that is (1) consistent with the private language argument's conclusion that meaning is public, (2) more specific than Wittgenstein's appeal to \"agreement in form of life,\" and (3) potentially testable through the philosophical experiment methodology. This is a genuine contribution to philosophy of language.\n\n#### Translation Note (Addendum to Dictionary)\n\nThe term 主体间性 should be translated as **intersubjectivity**. In the author's framework, intersubjectivity is not grounded in empathy, shared consciousness, or transcendental structures, but in **structural commensurability** --- the sharing of naturality conditions. This is distinct from Husserl's intersubjectivity (grounded in empathic appresentation), Habermas's (grounded in communicative rationality), and Wittgenstein's (grounded in agreement in form of life). The author's is perhaps closest to Brandom's inferentialism, where intersubjectivity is constituted by the mutual recognition of inferential commitments.\n\n---\n\n### S2. The Essays as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThe author proposes that \"philosophical experiments\" consist in constructing examples with specific structures to awaken specific experiences in readers, then checking whether those experiences are replicable (K1策略, methodology point 3). The author further suggests in \"写在最后\" that this practice is already ubiquitous: poetry, literature, art, music, games, memes, and even decorating one's room are all instances of constructing 境 to awaken experience.\n\nRe-reading the essays with this lens reveals that **several passages are indeed functioning as philosophical experiments** --- they are not merely *describing* philosophical positions but are actively *constructing* experiential structures in the reader. Let me identify the most significant instances.\n\n#### Experiment 1: The Sisyphus/Cat Essay as Dissolution of Absurdity\n\nThe essay 西西弗斯、班与猫 has a very specific argumentative structure that functions as a philosophical experiment:\n\n1. **Setup (establishing the target experience)**: The reader is invited to feel the absurdity of Sisyphus's situation, and then the absurdity of the office worker's situation. These are familiar scenarios; most readers will have a pre-existing $\\eta$ that connects \"repetitive labor\" with \"absurdity.\"\n\n2. **Pivot (disrupting the structural alignment)**: The author introduces the entrepreneur --- structurally identical labor, but no absurdity. This forces the reader to notice that their $\\eta$ between \"repetition\" and \"absurdity\" was not intrinsic but contingent on **alienation** (the meaning being external).\n\n3. **Dissolution (constructing a new $\\eta$)**: The cat example. Here the author constructs a scenario that is structurally identical to Sisyphus (repetitive, effortful, no cosmic purpose) but where the experience of absurdity is simply **absent**. The rhetorical force of this example depends on the reader *actually experiencing* the absence of absurdity when thinking about cat care. The sentence \"没有一个养猫的人会感到荒谬，荒谬从未来过\" is designed to trigger the reader's introspective verification: *Is this true? Do I feel absurdity when I think about caring for a cat?* The expected answer is no, and this no is itself the philosophical experiment's result.\n\nFrom a Wittgensteinian perspective, this is a paradigmatic example of **philosophical therapy conducted through examples** --- exactly what Wittgenstein does in the *Investigations*. Consider PI section 66, where Wittgenstein asks the reader to \"look and see\" whether there is something common to all games. The rhetorical structure is identical: Wittgenstein constructs a series of examples, invites the reader to introspect, and expects a specific experiential result (the *absence* of a common feature). The cat example works the same way: the author constructs a scenario, invites introspection, and expects the *absence* of absurdity.\n\nWhat makes this a philosophical *experiment* rather than merely a philosophical *argument* is that **the reader's introspective response is the evidence**. If the reader *does* feel absurdity when thinking about cat care, the experiment has failed for that reader, and the philosophical claim is not established. The claim is empirical-experiential, not logically necessary.\n\nThis is genuinely Wittgensteinian in method, even if the author's framework provides a more structural account of *why* the method works (the examples construct specific categorical structures that do or do not support a natural transformation involving \"absurdity\").\n\n#### Experiment 2: The 道德仁义礼 Reversal as Restructuring of the Reader's 境\n\nThe 道德仁义礼 passage in 后形而上学 整理 functions as a different kind of philosophical experiment --- one aimed at **restructuring** the reader's 境 rather than dissolving a specific feeling.\n\nThe passage proceeds in several steps:\n\n1. **The traditional ordering is presented**: 道 -> 德 -> 仁 -> 义 -> 礼. This is the familiar top-down metaphysical picture. Most readers educated in Chinese philosophy will have an existing $\\eta$ aligning this ordering with their understanding of the concepts.\n\n2. **The author introduces \"现象礼\"**: The reader is asked to recall the actual *experience* of ritual behavior --- how it feels, from the inside, to behave ritually toward others. This is a request for introspection.\n\n3. **The reversal is performed step by step**: 现象礼 -> 现象义 -> 现象仁 -> 德 -> 道. Each step is justified by appeal to the reader's own experience: \"this feeling is what you actually experience\" (切实感受到的). The reader is being guided through a reconstruction of their own experiential categories.\n\n4. **The inversion is made explicit**: \"整个逻辑的顺序就被倒反过来.\" The reader is invited to experience the *shift* --- the moment when the traditional ordering \"flips\" and the reader sees that what they took to be foundational (道) was actually derived (from 现象礼).\n\nFrom a Wittgensteinian perspective, this is a **perspicuous presentation** (*ubersichtliche Darstellung*, PI section 122) --- a rearrangement of what was already known that produces a new way of seeing. Wittgenstein's own method in the *Investigations* is precisely this: he does not introduce new facts but rearranges familiar facts so that we see them differently. The duck-rabbit (PI p. 194) is the iconic example: the same figure, seen differently.\n\nBut the 道德仁义礼 passage is more than a static perspicuous presentation --- it is a **guided restructuring** of the reader's experiential categories. The reader's $\\mathcal{E}$ is being actively reorganized: the meta-order of 道, 德, 仁, 义, 礼 is being inverted. If the experiment succeeds, the reader emerges with a different categorical structure --- one where phenomena are foundational and metaphysical concepts are derived. This is a restructuring of the reader's 境 itself.\n\nThis is something Wittgenstein does implicitly but never theorizes. The author, by providing the category-theoretic framework, can now describe *what happens* when a philosophical example restructures one's understanding: it changes the meta-ordering of objects in $\\mathcal{E}$, potentially changing which objects serve as universal properties, and thereby changing the reader's metaphysical commitments.\n\n#### Experiment 3: The \"1+1=2\" Passage as Evoking $\\eta$\n\nIn K1策略, the passage where the author asks the reader to introspect on the experience of understanding \"1+1=2\" is itself a philosophical experiment. The reader is asked:\n\n- Do you experience a \"direct confirmation sense\" when you see \"1+1=2\"?\n- Is this different from the experience of checking your answer against a reference?\n- Can you recognize the experience of $\\eta$ as identity (掌握) versus $\\eta$ as non-trivial (理解 without 掌握)?\n\nThe passage about the meme sentence \"你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国，记住我给出的原理\" is particularly effective: the reader is asked to notice the *failure* of $\\eta$ --- the experience of **not understanding** despite grammatical correctness. This negative result (the absence of alignment) is just as experimentally significant as the positive case.\n\n#### Experiment 4: The 忒修斯之船 (Ship of Theseus) as Evoking the Universal Property\n\nIn 范畴论与境 整理, the Ship of Theseus discussion asks the reader to introspect: \"When you think of the Ship of Theseus, what do you experience?\" The expected answer is a specific *feeling* --- the feeling that accompanies the concept of this particular ship, which is the universal property of the sub-category $\\mathcal{E}_{\\text{Theseus}}$. The author then shows that choosing $\\mathfrak{P}$ as the physical world leads to the paradox (the universal property becomes \"emptiness\"), while choosing $\\mathfrak{P}$ as phenomena resolves it (the universal property is the *feeling* of \"this ship\"). The reader is invited to verify this through introspection: \"Is the identity of the Ship of Theseus located in the physical planks or in my experience of the ship?\"\n\n#### Wittgensteinian Assessment of the Experimental Method\n\nWittgenstein would have a complex reaction to the philosophical experiment methodology:\n\n**What he would endorse**: The centrality of concrete examples, the appeal to introspective verification, the refusal to argue from abstract principles alone. These are all Wittgensteinian virtues. PI section 593: \"A main cause of philosophical disease --- a one-sided diet: one nourishes one's thinking with only one kind of example.\"\n\n**What he would resist**: The idea that introspective responses can be treated as *data* for a structural theory. For Wittgenstein, the examples are **self-sufficient** --- they do not serve a higher theoretical purpose. They are not evidence for a theory about natural transformations; they are the thing itself. The moment you treat introspective responses as data points in a structural theory, you have, from Wittgenstein's perspective, taken a step away from the phenomena and toward a philosophical construction.\n\n**What is genuinely new**: The author's key innovation is the claim that philosophical experiments can be designed *in advance* by specifying the categorical structure that should evoke the target experience. This is the reverse of Wittgenstein's method: Wittgenstein finds examples that dissolve existing confusions; the author proposes to *construct* examples that produce *specific predicted* experiences. This is a move from therapeutic philosophy to what we might call **constructive experimental phenomenology**. It has no precedent in Wittgenstein, though it has affinities with Austin's method of constructing specific speech-act scenarios to test linguistic intuitions. (Austin also believed that carefully constructed examples could serve as evidence for philosophical claims about language.)\n\n**The deepest insight**: The author's observation that the essays *themselves* are philosophical experiments --- not just descriptions of a theory but active interventions in the reader's experiential structure --- collapses the distinction between philosophical writing and philosophical practice. This is actually the most Wittgensteinian thing in the entire collection, because it embodies Wittgenstein's claim that philosophy is an *activity* (Tractatus 4.112), not a body of doctrine. The essays do not merely *say* that meaning is experiential alignment; they *show* it by constructing experiences in the reader. The medium is the message. This is philosophy as performance, as practice --- which is, in the end, what Wittgenstein always insisted philosophy should be.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":368,"oldLines":7,"newStart":368,"newLines":7,"lines":[" This is where the formal apparatus is developed. The identification of associations (联想) with morphisms, and the tower structure of experience, are the framework's most technically innovative features. The examples (Ship of Theseus, \"what is a person?\", dragon's blood) are not merely illustrative --- **they function as philosophical experiments** (see S2, Experiment 4): they invite the reader to introspect and verify that \"what is X?\" resolves into a specific *felt experience* (the universal property). The dragon's blood example (龙血) is particularly effective as an experiment in meta-order relativity: the reader is asked to experience the same concept at different meta-orders depending on the narrative context, demonstrating that categorical structure is perspectival rather than absolute."," "," ### 范畴论与境：K1策略","-This is the framework's culminating essay.

The natural transformation analysis of understanding, the structural verification criterion, and the proposal for philosophical experiments are the most philosophically significant contributions. The explicit engagement with language games and philosophical therapy shows the author's awareness of the Wittgensteinian tradition. **The essay itself performs philosophical experiments** (see S2, Experiment 3): the \"1+1=2\" passage and the meme-sentence passage are designed to evoke $\\eta$ (and its absence) in the reader directly. Crucially, the natural transformation $\\eta$ also serves as the mechanism for intersubjective verification (see S1): the naturality condition functions as the public criterion that replaces the need for shared qualia, giving mathematical content to Wittgenstein's beetle-in-the-box insight."," "," ### 关于诗意和境的一些零散想法"," This collection of notes extends and applies the framework.
