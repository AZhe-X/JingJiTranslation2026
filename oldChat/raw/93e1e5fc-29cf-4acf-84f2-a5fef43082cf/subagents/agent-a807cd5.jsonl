Better breathing room in the dense phenomenal-X accumulation.\n\n2. **Priority Flag 2 (line 42 sentence split) — ACCEPTED.** Split the 46-word subordinate clause at \"because\" into two sentences:\n   - \"...even though **no** actual phenomenal rightness or phenomenal humaneness appears in *my* phenomena.\"\n   - \"The feeling that arises from within the heart and the driving force are only what **I** feel when **I** practice phenomenal ritual conduct.\"\n   The period creates a decisive pause that lets the self/other gap claim land.\n\n3. **Priority Flag 3 (line 44 formatting) — ACCEPTED.** Changed \"**what a person is**\" to \"**what a *person* is**\" to match source formatting (bold + italic on 人). Confirmed against source: \"定义了**什么是*人***\".\n\n4. **Minor Flag 4 (line 36 phrasing) — ACCEPTED.** Changed \"run from first to last as from top to bottom\" to \"proceed from first to last, that is, from top to bottom.\" Clearer parallel construction.\n\n**Flags declined (with rationale):**\n\n5. **Minor Flag 5 (\"it is the phenomenal\") — DECLINED.** Adding \"the form itself\" risks B5 (adding content). The phrase is slightly flat but symmetrical with \"it is the metaphysical\" in the paired clause, which matters more for the argument's parallel structure.\n\n6. **Minor Flag 6 (footnote 3 \"is said to be\") — DECLINED.** \"Is said to be\" correctly signals these are traditional definitions being reported, not the author's own claims. \"Means\" would over-commit the author to these definitions, which the author is precisely in the process of reconceptualizing.\n\nUpdated file: `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L.

We therefore extend phenomenal humaneness and phenomenal rightness as our **explanation** of phenomenal ritual conduct more broadly. That is to say: because phenomenal ritual conduct — apparently — is exhibited in everyone around us, and because we interpret phenomenal ritual conduct as \"phenomenal humaneness generates phenomenal rightness, which in turn generates phenomenal ritual conduct,\" we conclude that everyone who practices phenomenal ritual conduct — ought to — possess this phenomenal humaneness.[^4]\n    39→\n    40→Next, we take what we believe (ought to be) universally possessed — here, phenomenal humaneness — and call it \"character\" (德, *de*).[^TN3] And why should there be such a universal regularity?

The feeling that arises from within the heart and the driving force are only what **I** feel when **I** practice phenomenal ritual conduct. I cannot truly feel **another person's** inner feelings; I have merely **imposed** my explanation of \"**my own** phenomenal ritual conduct\" onto the phenomenal ritual conduct we observe **others** performing. Therefore, the humaneness and rightness in other people are in fact *generated from* the phenomenal ritual conduct in phenomena. But in our interpretation, we take it to be the reverse: humaneness generates rightness, and from rightness one practices ritual conduct — as though phenomenal ritual conduct were generated *by* humaneness and rightness.\n    43→\n    44→Next, on the basis of this generated humaneness and rightness, we conclude: \"all people possess humaneness.\" But in fact it is: \"all people (**can**) possess humaneness,\" since we discovered from many people who exhibit humaneness that many people have it — humaneness is thus an inductively derived **property**. Yet our final understanding becomes: \"all people (**should**) possess humaneness\" — or rather, \"only those who possess humaneness count as human.\" And so a **property** that a person can have — here, humaneness — is transformed into a **definition** of personhood. These definitions, taken together, define **what a *person* is** — that is, \"character\": that which makes a person a person.[^TN4] We thus see that character, too, is in fact generated from humaneness — yet in our understanding we take it to be the reverse: *because* you are a person, *therefore* you must possess humaneness. Finally, character is a general regularity, because all things have their character (the pattern we take them to follow, that which makes a thing what it is), and so we gather all instances of character together, inductively abstract from them, and arrive at \"the Way.\" The Way, then, is in fact generated from character — yet we understand it as the Way generating character.\n    45→\n    46→Thus the entire logical order is reversed. The Way generates character; the character of a person is humaneness; from humaneness arises rightness; from rightness one practices ritual conduct.

In the conventional understanding — to take loving one's father as an example of humaneness — what I *ought to do* out of love for my father is rightness. And the concrete behavior that fulfills this rightness is ritual conduct. Rightness is thus the thing that connects humaneness to concrete action (ritual conduct). At the phenomenal level, I use \"phenomenal humaneness\" to describe the inner feeling (of love) I have toward my father — a feeling that impels me to act in certain ways.

Let me confirm each flag resolution:\n\n1. **Priority Flag 1 (em dashes):** Line 38 — confirmed. \"— apparently —\" and \"— ought to —\" are now in place. Better breathing room.\n\n2. **Priority Flag 2 (sentence split):** Line 42 — confirmed. The long subordinate clause is now split into two sentences at the period after \"phenomena.\" The self/other gap claim lands much more clearly.\n\n3. **Priority Flag 3 (bold+italic):** Line 44 — confirmed. \"**what a *person* is**\" now matches source formatting.\n\n4. **Minor Flag 4 (phrasing):** Line 36 — confirmed. \"proceed from first to last, that is, from top to bottom\" reads more cleanly.\n\n5. **Minor Flag 5 (declined):** Agree with rationale. The symmetry of \"it is the metaphysical\" / \"it is the phenomenal\" matters more than landing weight on the second clause alone.\n\n6. **Minor Flag 6 (declined):** Agree with rationale. \"Is said to be\" correctly distances the author from traditional definitions they are about to reconceptualize."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3476,"cache_read_input_tokens":101181,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":3476},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY1jyVMrMZTobh2ai82dy","type":"assistant","uuid":"fa0c4579-f5be-4e38-a9cd-a07989a77fa2","timestamp":"2026-02-11T05:37:51.232Z"}
