*Acknowledged feedback, waiting for team-lead instructions*

Thanks for the summary. I have all four recommendations noted and will keep them on hand. I'm currently waiting for instructions from team-lead on my next task. If your feedback pertains to something I'll be working on (e.g., a reader guide or review protocol), I'll incorporate it at that point. No need to re-send the full text for now -- your summary is clear.

Acknowledged. No action needed from my side -- the editor has my feedback on file and will incorporate as relevant. Continuing to stand by for team-lead instructions.
