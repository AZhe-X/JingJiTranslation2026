Parallels: 现象/第一实在 and Kant's Phenomena; 第〇实在 and Noumena/Things-in-Themselves\n    14→\n    15→The structural parallel is striking and runs deep, but it is not a simple equivalence.\n    16→\n    17→**现象 (Phenomenon) / 第一实在 (First Reality):**\n    18→In \"后形而上学 整理,\" the author declares that 现象 is what we \"possess\" (拥有) first and foremost -- it is the indubitable starting point from which all metaphysical construction proceeds upward. The author writes: \"现象...对于我们而言...是对于我们而言的'第一实在'\" (Phenomenon is, for us, the \"First Reality\"). This directly echoes Kant's position in the Critique of Pure Reason (CPR) that appearances (Erscheinungen) are the only objects of possible experience and that all cognition begins with experience (B1). The author's insistence that 现象 is \"indubitable\" (无可怀疑) because doubting it would leave no ground to stand on mirrors Kant's transcendental argument: without appearances, no categories, no judgments, no knowledge.\n    19→\n    20→However, there is a crucial nuance. For Kant, phenomena are already structured by the forms of intuition (space and time) and the categories of understanding. The author's 第一实在 appears to be pre-categorical -- raw experience or feeling (感受) prior to any intellectual processing. This is closer to what Kant would call the \"manifold of intuition\" before the synthesis of apprehension, or perhaps even closer to the sensory \"matter\" of appearance that Kant distinguishes from its \"form.\" The author's use of 感受 (feeling/experience) as the fundamental unit of P (现象) suggests something more phenomenologically immediate than Kantian Erscheinung, which is always already partially constituted by subjective forms.\n    21→\n    22→**第〇实在 (Zeroth Reality) and Noumena:**\n    23→The author's 第〇实在 corresponds structurally to Kant's thing-in-itself (Ding an sich). The author states explicitly: \"对于我们而言，并不存在第〇实在，而只存在第二实在。当我们提出第〇实在时，这个我们所提出的东西就是第二实在\" (For us, there is no Zeroth Reality, only Second Reality. When we propose the Zeroth Reality, what we propose is already Second Reality). This is remarkably close to Kant's famous doctrine that the thing-in-itself is a \"limiting concept\" (Grenzbegriff, B310-311) -- it cannot be known, and any attempt to determine it positively transforms it into an object of possible experience, i.e., a phenomenon.\n    24→\n    25→The author reinforces this with the Daoist parallel: 道 (the Way), like the thing-in-itself, is supposed to be the ultimate ground, but as soon as we articulate it, it becomes a construct of our understanding -- 第二实在. The author's formulation \"真正的道不可道不可名\" directly parallels the ineffability of Kant's noumenon in the positive sense.\n    26→\n    27→**Key difference:** Kant maintains a two-world (or two-aspect) distinction between phenomena and noumena that is architectonically necessary for his system. The author, working in a post-metaphysical framework, treats 第〇实在 as something whose \"special position\" has been \"disenchanted\" (祛魅). The post-metaphysical move is not merely to say we cannot know the thing-in-itself (Kant already says this), but to recognize that the *desire* for such a ground is itself non-rational (非理性). Kant would never characterize the postulation of the noumenon as non-rational -- for him it is a necessary thought of reason.\n    28→\n    29→---\n    30→\n    31→## 2. The Stable Structure S_E and Kantian Categories/Forms of Intuition\n    32→\n    33→The author's concept of S_E -- a stable structure preserved across the evolution of 境 (E) under the evolution functor T -- is perhaps the most directly Kantian element of the entire framework.\n    34→\n    35→In the K1 strategy essay, the author writes: \"如果你认为这一时刻是某种E_t首次出现的时刻，因此有可能独立于经验与感官印象，则你可以将这种稳定结构当中的这一部分认定为'先天'\" (If you consider this moment as the first appearance of E_t, independent of experience and sensory impressions, you may identify this part of the stable structure as \"a priori\"). Further: \"如果你认为E表示了某种认知，那么假如能够证明这一稳定结构当中的一部分一旦缺失，则无法从P_t中构建任何E_t，则可以将这部分稳定结构称之为'认知结构'\" (If E represents some cognition, and if it can be shown that without part of this stable structure no E_t can be constructed from P_t, then this part may be called \"cognitive structure\").\n    36→\n    37→This is a remarkably precise restatement of the Kantian transcendental argument for the categories. In CPR, Kant argues that the categories are conditions of the possibility of experience: without them, the manifold of intuition could not be unified into coherent experience (B143-144, the Transcendental Deduction). The author's S_{E_c} (the minimal stable structure) maps onto Kant's pure forms -- the structures that must be in place before any experience can be constituted.\n    38→\n    39→**Parallels with specific Kantian elements:**\n    40→\n    41→- **Forms of intuition (space and time):** The author's framework does not single out spatial and temporal forms as Kant does. Instead, the \"stable structure\" is left formally unspecified -- it is whatever structure the evolution functor preserves. This is more general than Kant, and deliberately so.\n    42→\n    43→- **Categories of understanding:** The author's description of how concepts like 笔 (pen) emerge as universal properties (泛性质) in subcategories of E parallels Kant's account of how the categories unify the manifold under concepts. The author's definition of 形而上 as universal property in a subcategory is structurally equivalent to a concept under which particulars are subsumed.\n    44→\n    45→- **The schematism:** The author's account of how the evolution functor T mediates between P (raw phenomena) and structured E (境) plays a role analogous to Kant's schematism, which mediates between the pure categories and sensible intuition. The natural transformation eta in the K1 strategy -- which links the evolution of formal structures with the evolution of experience -- is essentially a formalization of this mediating function.\n    46→\n    47→**Key difference:** Kant specifies the categories a priori through the table of judgments. The author deliberately leaves S_E unspecified and proposes to discover it empirically through \"philosophical experiments\" -- a fundamentally different methodological commitment. The author's approach is closer to a neo-Kantian research program or even to cognitive science's search for innate cognitive structures, rather than Kant's deductive approach.\n    48→\n    49→---\n    50→\n    51→## 3. The Meaning Question as \"Another Kind of Kantian Question\"\n    52→\n    53→In the appendix \"关于诗意和境的一些零散想法,\" the author and their interlocutor explicitly state:\n    54→\n    55→> \"第二个问题可能是另一类康德问题。即'一件事物的意义是什么'这一问题的回答可能是一种知识（即可能是一种先天综合判断），那么他自然不是任何物自体（如果存在），而是通过对现象的主观综合而来。\"\n    56→\n    57→This is a philosophically precise and important claim. Let me unpack it:\n    58→\n    59→**Kant's original question:** \"How are synthetic a priori judgments possible?\" (B19). This asks how we can have knowledge that is both necessarily true (a priori) and substantively informative about experience (synthetic). Kant's answer: through the transcendental conditions of experience -- the forms of intuition and categories of understanding structure experience in ways that yield necessarily true but non-trivial knowledge.\n    60→\n    61→**The author's parallel question:** \"How is meaning possible?\" -- specifically, how does meaning enter our experiential field or arise within it, given that there is no metaphysical ground (第〇实在) to supply it? The author proposes that the answer to \"what does X mean?\" is itself a kind of knowledge -- specifically, knowledge gained through the subjective synthesis of phenomena, not through access to any thing-in-itself.\n    62→\n    63→**The depth of this parallel:** The author is claiming that meaning has the same epistemic structure as scientific knowledge in Kant's framework. Just as \"every event has a cause\" is synthetic a priori (it cannot be derived from the concept of \"event\" alone, nor from pure experience alone, but emerges from the conditions of possible experience), so too \"this experience is meaningful in such-and-such a way\" is synthetic a priori -- it cannot be derived from the bare content of experience alone, nor from pure concepts alone, but emerges from the structural conditions (S_E, the stable structure of 境) through which experience is constituted.\n    64→\n    65→This is a genuinely original philosophical move. Kant restricted synthetic a priori knowledge to mathematics and natural science. The author is extending the Kantian architecture to the domain of meaning and value -- precisely the domain Kant cordoned off in the first Critique as belonging to practical reason rather than theoretical reason. The author is, in effect, proposing a \"Critique of Meaning\" that parallels the Critique of Pure Reason.\n    66→\n    67→The author also notes: \"我们（出于我的个人爱好）尝试用'境'的框架对这种综合进行了描述\" -- they are using the 境 framework to describe this synthesis, just as Kant used the architectonic of the three Critiques.\n    68→\n    69→---\n    70→\n    71→## 4. Synthetic A Priori Knowledge About Experience\n    72→\n    73→The question of whether the author's framework produces synthetic a priori knowledge is subtle and requires careful analysis.\n    74→\n    75→**The case for yes:**\n    76→\n    77→The author's S_E is posited as a structure that is:\n    78→- Preserved across all temporal evolution of E (hence invariant, hence in some sense necessary)\n    79→- Not derivable from any particular content of experience (hence not empirical in the usual sense)\n    80→- Substantively constraining of what experiences are possible (hence synthetic rather than merely analytic)\n    81→\n    82→This has the hallmarks of synthetic a priori knowledge. The claim \"there exists a stable structure S_E such that any E_t must preserve it\" is synthetic (it says something substantive about the structure of experience) and, if true, would be a priori (it holds necessarily for all possible evolutions of E).\n    83→\n    84→Furthermore, the natural transformation conditions in the K1 strategy -- the requirement that the evolution of formal structures (mathematics, language) be \"aligned\" with the evolution of experience -- yield specific, testable predictions about the structure of understanding. The claim that \"understanding requires a natural transformation between structural evolution and experiential evolution\" is a synthetic a priori claim about what it means to understand anything at all.\n    85→\n    86→**The case for \"not quite\":**\n    87→\n    88→The author is careful to note that the framework is \"descriptive\" (描述性的) rather than prescriptive. The author explicitly declines to make ontological claims about S_E: \"他是否具有某种形而上意义...在此我们并未得出结论.\" This modesty distinguishes the approach from Kant's, who makes strong transcendental claims about the necessity of the categories.\n    89→\n    90→Moreover, the author proposes to discover S_E through \"philosophical experiments\" -- empirical investigation of which structures can be stably evoked across subjects. This makes the framework more like an empirical research program about the structure of experience than a system of synthetic a priori truths in Kant's strong sense.\n    91→\n    92→**Assessment:** The framework has the *form* of synthetic a priori knowledge (necessary structural conditions of possible experience) but the author deliberately withholds the strong modal claims that Kant makes. The framework could be read as providing the *conditions* under which synthetic a priori knowledge about meaning and experience would be possible, while leaving the specific content of that knowledge to be filled in through practice and investigation. This is a philosophically sophisticated middle path.\n    93→\n    94→---\n    95→\n    96→## 5. Post-Metaphysical Framework and Kant's Limitation of Metaphysics\n    97→\n    98→Kant's critical project in the CPR is fundamentally a limitation of metaphysics: the understanding can only operate legitimately within the bounds of possible experience, and the traditional metaphysical questions (God, freedom, immortality, the soul) cannot be answered by theoretical reason because they concern objects beyond possible experience.\n    99→\n   100→The author's post-metaphysical framework (后形而上学) shares this limiting impulse but goes further in several respects:\n   101→\n   102→**Shared ground:**\n   103→- Both Kant and the author insist that knowledge must begin with and remain tethered to phenomena/experience.\n   104→- Both deny that we can reach a \"终极实在\" (ultimate reality) through theoretical/rational means.\n   105→- Both treat metaphysical constructs as arising from phenomena rather than generating them.\n   106→\n   107→**Where the author goes further:**\n   108→\n   109→1. **Disenchantment of the noumenon:** Kant maintains the noumenon as a necessary limiting concept and even gives it practical significance (in moral philosophy). The author performs a \"祛魅\" (disenchantment) that Kant would not: the 第〇实在 loses its \"special position\" entirely. The non-rational (非理性) desire for ultimate reality is acknowledged and accepted, but not given the architectonic significance Kant gives to the Ideas of Reason.\n   110→\n   111→2. **Nihilism as transitional:** The author treats nihilism not as a conclusion but as a transitional moment -- the collapse of pre-metaphysical frameworks that clears ground for post-metaphysical construction. Kant does not pass through nihilism in this way; his critical philosophy is designed precisely to prevent the slide into nihilism by securing the legitimate domains of knowledge, morality, and aesthetic judgment.\n   112→\n   113→3. **Constructive rebuilding:** The author's post-metaphysics is actively constructive. After the disenchantment, we rebuild through 实践 (practice) and 诗意 (poetic engagement). This is closer to the spirit of Fichte's or the early Romantics' response to Kant than to Kant himself.\n   114→\n   115→4. **The role of non-rationality:** The author explicitly acknowledges that our pursuit of metaphysical structure (恒常性, constancy) is non-rational, and that this non-rationality must be \"承认\" (acknowledged). Kant would resist this characterization: for him, reason's demand for the unconditioned is rational, even if it cannot be satisfied theoretically. The author's acknowledgment of non-rationality at the foundation is closer to Nietzsche's genealogical approach or to certain strands of existentialism.\n   116→\n   117→---\n   118→\n   119→## 6. Transcendental Argument Structure: Phenomena -> Conditions of Possibility -> Framework\n   120→\n   121→The author's argumentative structure is recognizably transcendental in form, even if the author does not use this terminology.\n   122→\n   123→**The classical Kantian transcendental argument:**\n   124→1. Experience has such-and-such features (premise).\n   125→2. X is a necessary condition for experience to have those features (transcendental premise).\n   126→3. Therefore X obtains (conclusion).\n   127→\n   128→**The author's parallel structure:**\n   129→1. We have phenomena (P / 现象 / 第一实在) -- this is indubitable.\n   130→2. Phenomena exhibit structure (E / 境) -- we can identify this through introspection and formal description.\n   131→3. The evolution of E under T preserves a stable structure S_E.\n   132→4. S_E is a condition of possibility for any E_t to be constituted from P_t.\n   133→5. Therefore S_E obtains as a structural feature of experience.\n   134→\n   135→Steps 3-4 are the transcendental moment. The author argues (in K1 strategy) that if S_E were absent, no 境 could be constructed from phenomena -- this is structurally identical to Kant's argument that without the categories, no experience would be possible.\n   136→\n   137→**The natural transformation as transcendental condition:** The requirement that formal structural evolution and experiential evolution be linked by a natural transformation (eta) is itself a transcendental condition -- a condition of the possibility of understanding anything. The author's claim is: for any structured domain (language, mathematics, etc.) to be understandable, there must exist this alignment between structural and experiential evolution. This is a transcendental claim about the conditions of intelligibility.\n   138→\n   139→**Differences from Kant's transcendental arguments:**\n   140→- Kant derives the categories from the table of judgments through a systematic deduction. The author's S_E is posited as a conjecture to be investigated, not deduced.\n   141→- Kant's transcendental arguments yield apodictic certainty. The author's are explicitly tentative and open to empirical investigation.\n   142→- The author's framework allows for different S_E structures for different subjects or populations -- a relativization that Kant would not countenance for the categories.\n   143→\n   144→---\n   145→\n   146→## 7. Key Divergences from Kant -- Differences and Innovations\n   147→\n   148→### 7a. Phenomenological immediacy vs. transcendental constitution\n   149→Kant holds that phenomena are always already constituted by the forms of intuition and categories. The author's 第一实在 / P appears to be pre-constitutive -- raw feeling (感受) before any structuring. This is more Husserlian than Kantian, closer to the \"lived experience\" (Erlebnis) of phenomenology.\n   150→\n   151→### 7b. Category theory vs. table of categories\n   152→Kant derives his twelve categories from the logical forms of judgment. The author uses mathematical category theory (范畴论) as the descriptive language for the structure of experience. This is not merely a notational choice -- it shifts the framework from Kant's logic-first approach to a structure-first approach. Universal properties (泛性质) replace Kantian categories, functors replace the schematism, natural transformations replace the synthetic unity of apperception. This is a genuine innovation: it provides a formally precise language for describing what Kant could only gesture at with his often opaque technical vocabulary.\n   153→\n   154→### 7c. The role of evolution and dynamics\n   155→Kant's framework is essentially static -- the categories and forms of intuition do not change. The author introduces the evolution functor T, making the structure of experience fundamentally dynamic. This allows for developmental, historical, and cultural variation in cognitive structure -- something Kant's architecture cannot accommodate. The author explicitly notes that S_E can be investigated across different populations and developmental stages.\n   156→\n   157→### 7d. Meaning as a legitimate object of transcendental inquiry\n   158→As discussed in section 3, the author extends the Kantian framework to cover meaning and value -- domains Kant restricted to practical reason. This is the most significant philosophical innovation: a unified transcendental framework for both knowledge and meaning.\n   159→\n   160→### 7e. The poetic (诗意) as the proper stance\n   161→Kant's response to the limitation of metaphysics is the critical philosopher's \"discipline of pure reason.\" The author's response is 诗意 -- poetic engagement with experience, a \"lucid dreaming\" (清醒的梦境) in which we construct and inhabit meaningful structures while knowing they are constructions. This has more affinity with Nietzsche's \"gay science,\" Heidegger's \"poetic dwelling,\" or the Daoist sage's play than with Kantian critical sobriety.\n   162→\n   163→### 7f. Empirical verifiability of philosophical claims\n   164→The author proposes \"philosophical experiments\" (哲学实验) -- using structured stimuli to evoke specific experiences across subjects, thereby empirically testing claims about the structure of experience. Kant would regard this as a category mistake: transcendental claims are about conditions of possibility, not empirical regularities. The author's approach is closer to experimental philosophy or cognitive science, though framed within a transcendental architecture.\n   165→\n   166→### 7g. Non-rationality at the foundation\n   167→As noted, the author acknowledges that the drive toward metaphysical structure is fundamentally non-rational. Kant's architectonic presupposes that reason itself demands the unconditioned -- the Ideas of Reason are products of reason's own nature. The author's genealogy of metaphysical desire (from non-rationality to constancy to self-realization) is closer to Nietzsche or Schopenhauer.\n   168→\n   169→### 7h. Renormalization as a model for abstraction\n   170→The first essay on collective interest uses the physical concept of renormalization as a model for how abstract concepts emerge from concrete phenomena at different scales. This is entirely outside Kant's conceptual repertoire and represents a genuinely novel approach to the problem of abstraction -- one that draws on contemporary physics rather than formal logic.\n   171→\n   172→---\n   173→\n   174→## 8. Translation Challenges for Terms with Kantian Resonance\n   175→\n   176→### 8a. 现象 (xianxiang) -- \"Phenomenon\"\n   177→The standard philosophical translation is \"phenomenon,\" which carries strong Kantian resonance. However, the author's usage is broader than Kant's Erscheinung: it includes raw feeling, sensory experience, and everything in the experiential field before any intellectual processing. Translating as \"phenomenon\" risks importing Kantian assumptions about transcendental constitution that the author does not make. Consider: \"phenomenon\" in the main text, with a translator's note explaining the broader scope; or occasionally \"experiential field\" or \"what is given in experience\" for clarity.\n   178→\n   179→### 8b. 第一实在 -- \"First Reality\"\n   180→This is the author's own coinage. The footnote explains it is a name, not an ontological claim. \"First reality\" works well and carries the appropriate connotation of epistemic primacy. A translator's note should clarify that \"first\" is ordinal (what we encounter first), not ontological (what exists first). The Kantian reader will naturally hear echoes of \"empirical reality\" (empirische Realitat).\n   181→\n   182→### 8c. 第〇实在 -- \"Zeroth Reality\"\n   183→Another coinage. \"Zeroth reality\" preserves the mathematical/ordinal flavor. The Kantian resonance is with the \"thing-in-itself\" or \"noumenon.\" A note should explain the parallel and the differences.\n   184→\n   185→### 8d. 第二实在 -- \"Second Reality\"\n   186→This corresponds roughly to the \"objective world as we construct it\" -- what Kant would call the object of experience as constituted by the understanding. \"Second reality\" or \"constructed reality\" both work.\n   187→\n   188→### 8e. 形而上 / 形而上学\n   189→\"The metaphysical\" / \"metaphysics.\" The author carefully distinguishes 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a property or construct) from 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the study of the metaphysical). This distinction is important and should be preserved in translation. The author's reinterpretation of 形 as 现象 (phenomenon) rather than the traditional reading is a significant hermeneutical move that should be noted.\n   190→\n   191→### 8f. 恒常 (hengchang) -- \"Constancy\" or \"Permanence\"\n   192→This is the author's term for what underlies all metaphysical construction. In Kantian terms, this resonates with the First Analogy (the principle of permanence of substance) and more broadly with the synthetic unity that the understanding imposes on experience. \"Constancy\" is the best translation; \"permanence\" carries too much Kantian specificity.\n   193→\n   194→### 8g. 境 (jing) -- This is the hardest term.\n   195→The author defines it through the symbol E (Enclosed, Emotion, Experience). It is the structured whole of experience at a moment. It has no direct Kantian equivalent, though it resonates with several concepts: the \"field of consciousness,\" the \"unity of apperception,\" the \"world\" as a totality of experience. Given its Buddhist and Chinese aesthetic connotations (境界 = realm, state of being), I would recommend keeping it untranslated as \"Jing\" or translating as \"experiential realm\" or \"realm of experience\" -- but see the team's overall decision on this central term.\n   196→\n   197→### 8h. 诗意 (shiyi) -- \"The Poetic\" or \"Poetic Engagement\"\n   198→This has no Kantian equivalent. It resonates more with Heidegger's \"dichterisch wohnen\" (poetic dwelling) or with Schiller's \"aesthetic education.\" In the context of Kant, one might compare it to the \"free play of imagination and understanding\" in the third Critique, but the author's concept is broader and existentially weightier.\n   199→\n   200→### 8i. 非理性 (fei lixing) -- \"The Non-rational\"\n   201→Not \"irrational\" (which implies opposition to reason) but \"non-rational\" (which implies something outside reason's domain). This is important: the author's framework acknowledges non-rational drives without condemning them. In Kantian terms, this might be compared to the \"interest of reason\" -- but Kant would insist that reason's interests are rational, whereas the author locates the drive for metaphysics in something prior to and outside of reason.\n   202→\n   203→### 8j. 稳定结构 (S_E) -- \"Stable Structure\"\n   204→The direct translation works. In Kantian terms, this corresponds to \"conditions of possible experience\" or \"transcendental structure.\" The mathematical formalism (category theory, functors, natural transformations) does not have Kantian equivalents and should be rendered in standard mathematical English.\n   205→\n   206→### 8k. 梦境 -- \"Dreamscape\" or \"Dream-realm\"\n   207→The author's technical use of this term (as the environment in which meaning becomes possible) is distant from ordinary usage. It has no Kantian parallel but resonates with Fichte's notion of productive imagination.\n   208→\n   209→---\n   210→\n   211→## 9. Overall Significance from a Kantian Perspective\n   212→\n   213→This collection of essays represents a genuinely original philosophical project that stands in a complex and productive relationship with the Kantian tradition. Let me summarize its significance:\n   214→\n   215→### 9a. A post-Kantian transcendental philosophy of meaning\n   216→The most important achievement, from a Kantian perspective, is the extension of the transcendental framework from knowledge to meaning. Kant asked: \"How is experience possible?\" and \"How is synthetic a priori knowledge possible?\" The author asks: \"How is meaning possible?\" -- and provides a framework (境, S_E, evolution functors, natural transformations) that answers this question with the same structural rigor that Kant brought to the first two questions. This fills a genuine gap in the Kantian tradition: Kant himself was unable to give a satisfactory transcendental account of meaning, aesthetic experience, or existential significance, distributing these across the three Critiques in ways that have never been fully unified.\n   217→\n   218→### 9b. Mathematical formalization of transcendental structures\n   219→The use of category theory to formalize what Kant could only describe in discursive prose is a significant methodological advance. The notion of universal properties as the structure of concepts, functors as the dynamics of cognitive evolution, and natural transformations as the conditions of understanding -- these provide a precision and generativity that Kant's own vocabulary lacks. This opens the possibility of deriving specific, testable claims from the transcendental framework.\n   220→\n   221→### 9c. A Chinese philosophical inflection of the critical project\n   222→The author's engagement with Daoist concepts (道德仁义礼) as examples of metaphysical construction, and the use of 境 (a term with deep roots in Buddhist and Chinese aesthetic thought) as the central concept, represents a genuine cross-cultural philosophical achievement. The author is not merely applying Kantian categories to Chinese material, nor merely translating Chinese concepts into Western terms, but constructing a new framework that draws on both traditions and transcends both.\n   223→\n   224→### 9d. The integration of phenomenology, pragmatism, and transcendental philosophy\n   225→The author's insistence on 实践 (practice), the acknowledgment of 非理性 (the non-rational), the phenomenological emphasis on 感受 (feeling), and the pragmatic orientation toward what is \"useful\" and \"accessible\" -- these weave together strands from Kant, Husserl, Wittgenstein (language games), Heidegger (Being-in-the-world), pragmatism, and Chinese philosophy into a coherent whole. The result is more philosophically ambitious and more practically oriented than any of these traditions alone.\n   226→\n   227→### 9e. Limitations and open questions from a Kantian perspective\n   228→- The author does not provide a transcendental deduction in Kant's sense -- a proof that S_E must have such-and-such a form. The stable structure is conjectured, not deduced.\n   229→- The relativization of S_E to different populations and developmental stages raises the question of whether there is a truly universal S_E, or whether the framework only yields culturally and individually relative \"transcendental\" structures. Kant would insist on universality; the author leaves this open.\n   230→- The relationship between the author's framework and normativity remains undeveloped. Kant's categories are not just structures of experience but norms of cognition -- they tell us what experience *ought* to be like. The author's descriptive stance avoids normative claims, but the question of whether and how norms emerge from the 境 framework remains.\n   231→- The treatment of time is underdeveloped compared to Kant. In CPR, time is the form of inner sense and the medium of all synthesis. The author's evolution functor T operates over a label t that \"不一定是物理时间\" (is not necessarily physical time). A more thorough engagement with temporality would strengthen the framework.\n   232→\n   233→### 9f. The essay on knowledge (\"A Thought on Knowledge\") from a Kantian lens\n   234→This essay argues that knowledge in practice reduces to belief, since truth is methodologically inaccessible and justification ultimately rests on phenomena or other beliefs. From a Kantian perspective, this is both correct and incomplete. Kant would agree that we have no direct access to truth (things-in-themselves), and that knowledge is constituted through the synthesis of phenomena. But Kant would insist that knowledge is more than mere belief: it is belief that is structured by the categories and grounded in the synthetic unity of apperception. The author's framework (in the later essays) actually provides the resources to make this Kantian point: knowledge is belief that is embedded in a stable structure S_K within the evolution of the knowledge-category E_K. The K1 strategy essay's treatment of knowledge-generation through language games and the $(F_{L \\to K})_t$ functor is precisely the kind of structural account that distinguishes knowledge from mere belief.\n   235→\n   236→### 9g. The Sisyphus essay from a Kantian lens\n   237→The dissolution of absurdism through the recognition that meaning is internally generated (not sought from the external universe) has a Kantian resonance: the autonomy of practical reason. For Kant, moral meaning does not come from the world but from the rational will's self-legislation. The author's version is broader (meaning comes from internal feeling, not just rational will) and more existentially engaged, but the structural move -- from seeking meaning outside to recognizing it as internally constituted -- is the same.\n   238→\n   239→---\n   240→\n   241→## Final Assessment\n   242→\n   243→These essays constitute a serious, original, and philosophically sophisticated body of work that deserves to be understood as a contribution to post-Kantian transcendental philosophy. The translation should make the Kantian resonances explicit where appropriate (through careful terminological choices and translator's notes) while also making clear where the author innovates beyond or diverges from the Kantian framework. The author's own acknowledgment that the meaning question is \"another kind of Kantian question\" provides a valuable entry point for Western readers who are likely to approach this work through the lens of the critical tradition.\n   244→\n   245→The appendix note -- \"为诗性体验和哲学奠定合法性基础\" (laying a legitimacy foundation for poetic experience and philosophy) -- explicitly parallels Kant's project of \"laying a legitimacy foundation for empirical science.\" This self-awareness on the author's part confirms that the Kantian parallel is not merely imposed by the reader but is part of the author's own self-understanding of what they are doing. The translation should honor this self-understanding while also noting where the author's project exceeds or transforms the Kantian template.\n   246→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

其一]]》草稿的整理，删去了一些相关性较弱和未完成的部分。在这一篇文章里，作者用自己的语言大概记录和梳理其高中时期对传统的形而上学的一些看法。许多名词和概念和哲学传统有差别，需要读者注意甄别以免混淆。\n     8→\n     9→\n    10→## 前形而上学\n    11→\n    12→*前形而上学*[^1]，或者我也把它叫做传统形而上学，经典形而上学，是我创造出来的一个名词。所谓前，指的是相对于虚无主义而言的前，即在虚无主义之前的形而上学。\n    13→\n    14→我们将我们在当前所“拥有”的一切叫做*现象*。而在*现象*上，我们推断出一系列*现象*的运行方式/规律。我们似乎认为，所谓“现象的运行方式/规律”，既是前形而上学[^2]。\n    15→\n    16→前形而上学有一个**形式上的**错误理解，既是对“*上*”的理解。形而上学的英文，“*metaphysics*”，字面上来看，既是*元物理*。倘若把物理理解为*现象*，那么形而上学所描述的，既是产生现象的原因。然而事实上，请看上一段对形而上学的解释，形而上学事实上是**自现象而产生的**。所谓“上”，应当是我们**基于现象之上**而有的一套理解，而非自上而下由形而上**生成**了形。因此，*现象*，亦或者说我们所感受到的世界，对于我们而言，并非*生成的世界*，而是对于我们而言的“*第一实在*”[^25]。我们任何的对于现象的理解，都**基于**现象。唯有承认现象既是“*第一实在*”，我们才能够作出任何形而上的推断。\n    17→\n    18→请看如下例子：\n    19→\n    20→> 故失*道*而后*德*，失*德*而后*仁*，失*仁*而后*义*，失*义*而后*礼*。——老子\n    21→\n    22→其中，*道*，*德*，*仁*，*义*，*礼*，自前往后，既是从上至下。*道*生万物，*道*既是最“元始”的*元物理*（*metaphysics*），而有此往后，皆是*生成*的。因此，道既是最上者，是为形而上，而礼既是最下者，是为形。\n    23→\n    24→然而，礼事实上是从现象所总结出来的，我们不妨将这个**切实**的*现象*中的行为称之为“*现象礼*”，我对“*现象礼*”有一个**解释**，既是我对人时发乎于心的对他人感受，这个感受是我个人**切实**感受到的，因而是*现象*的一部分，因此我将其称之为“*现象仁*”。这个感受使得我想要去如何如何地对待他人，这种推动力（motivation）也是我所**切实**感受到的，因此我将其称之为“*现象义*”[^3]。“*现象礼*”不仅仅存在于在我对待他人时，也同样存在于其他人是如何对待他人上，我们便将“*现象仁*”和“*现象义*”作为我们对“*现象礼*”的**解释**推而广之。也就是说，因为“*现象礼*”（似乎）在我们周围的所有人身上都有体现，而我们认为（将“*现象礼*”解释为）“*现象仁*”产生了“*现象义*”又产生了”*现象礼*”，所以我们认为所有（行“现象礼”的）人都（应当）有这种“*现象仁*”[^4]。接下来，我们便把我们认为（应当是）人人皆而有之的东西，在这里便是“*现象仁*”，称之为“*德*”，而为什么会有这种人人皆而有之的**规律**呢？因为“*道*”[^24]。\n    25→\n    26→因此我们看到，在现象的层面上，*仁义*仅仅是对于*礼*的一个解释。对于我们看到的外在的*现象*而言，事实上我们仅仅看到了*现象*中的“*现象礼*”，因而我们**推断**出了“*现象义*”，续而由“*现象义*”**推断**出了“*现象仁*”，即便并**没有**任何**切实**的“*现象义*”和“*现象仁*”出现在我的*现象*中，因为**我**所感受到的发乎于心的感受和推动力仅仅是**我**在行“*现象礼*”时所感受到的，而我无法真正感受到**他人**的内心感受，仅仅是将我对“**自己**的‘*现象礼*’”的解释**套用**到了我们看到的**别人**所行的“*现象礼*”上。因此，别人身上的*仁义*，其实是由*现象*中的“*现象礼*”所生成的。但是我们在解释上却认为是由*仁*而生*义*，因*义*而行*礼*，“*现象礼*”反而是由*仁义*所生成的了。接下来，基于这种生成的*仁义*，我们便总结出来，“人都是有*仁*的”。但是，事实上是“人都是（**可以**）有*仁*的”，因为我们是从诸多有*仁*的人身上发现许多人都是有*仁*的，因此*仁*是我们归纳出来的一个**属性**（**property**）。但是我们最终对其的理解是“人都是（**应该**）有*仁*的”——或者说，“有*仁*的才是人”。因此人可以拥有的一个**属性**，在这里既是“*仁*”，反而变成了人的一个**定义**。而这些**定义**合起来，便定义了**什么是*人***——也就是“*德*”，使得*人*而成为*人*的东西。因此我们看到，事实上“*德*”也是由“*仁*”生成的，但是我们在理解上却认为，是因“*德*”而生“*仁*”：因为你是*人*，所以你要有*仁*。最后，“*德*”是一种一般的规律，因为凡事诸物皆有其*德*（我们认为他应该遵守的规律，使得一样东西成为其本身的东西），因而又将所有的“*德*”合起来，归纳抽象出“*道*”，因此“*道*”实则为“*德*”而生成的，我们却理解为“*道*”生成了“*德*”。\n    27→\n    28→因此，整个逻辑的顺序就被倒反过来。道生德，人德为仁，因仁生义，因义行礼。而这最后的“*礼*”已经不再是一开始的“*现象礼*”，因为从“*现象礼*”生成“*道*”的逻辑已经被**掩埋不见**，已经全部**失**去了，人们以为“*道*”才是最元始的*元物理*。因此最终生成的“*礼*”已然仅仅是一种规范，而不一定是最初的（解释上）发乎于心的而有的*现象礼*了。\n    29→\n    30→在实践中，这种失将继续层层下跌，逐末而忘本。上述并非对《老子》的解释，而是在这一段当中，恰好出现了这种自形而上至形的阶梯，因此将此作为一个例子。\n    31→\n    32→### 形而上\n    33→\n    34→在上述的例子中，我用了中国哲学举例。然而，中国哲学大多是有*形而上*而无*形而上学*的。所谓形而上学，既是研究形而上的学科和学问，是对形而上的学习和分析。在西方，形而上学追求的是*终极实在*，既是最终的，最原始的*元物理*——*根源*之所在。而在中国，大多数时候，我们在一个给定好的*形而上*的框架中抵达这个框架中的*至善*，追求的是*圣人*，因而一是皆以*修身*为*本*。对于*形而上*的探索（也就是*形而上学*）因而相较西方要少了许多。因此，一定要区分*形而上*和*形而上学*的区别。*形而上*是我们对现象的一种**理解**、**解释**。而*形而上学*是对形而上的**研究**。\n    35→\n    36→\n    37→在这里我将形而上分为如下几种：\n    38→\n    39→#### *第〇种*：经验的总结\n    40→\n    41→形而上的核心是***恒常***。我们需要在变化的现象之中寻找到（追求）一种*恒常*性，因此我们才能够有意作出任何有（对于我们而言的）结果的行为。有人将形而上学的基础总结为*同一*，*因果*。然而，*因果*即为时间上的*同一*，因此其本质上是一回事。我在这里将其称之为*恒常*。*恒常*的意义是一种（我们给自己的）“**保证**”。这个**保证**既是：同样的*现象*（*实在*）将会**重复**的出现。\n    42→\n    43→也就是说，我们首先认为，我们眼前的一个苹果（的图像），在下一刻，他和这一刻，是**同一个***东西*——既是*恒常*。\n    44→我们看着这个苹果（的图像）在我们的视野中变化位置，缩放，甚至旋转（旋转改变了他的图像，因而递进），我们却依旧认为这是**同一个***东西*——既是*恒常*。\n    45→\n    46→我们根据我们**眼前的**这个**具体的**[^5]苹果的图像，构建了一个（具体的）“*东西*”，也就是这一个**具体**的（我们认为是）“客观存在的”苹果，这个（具体的）“*东西*”，相对于变化的*现象*，既是*恒常*。\n    47→注意到，这个“*东西*”实则我们对我们**眼前的**苹果图像的**解释**——他是由现象中的苹果图像所*生成*的。我们把这个“*东西*”叫做“*第二实在*”。\n    48→\n    49→我们看到了数个不同的具体的苹果，我们从他们的相似之处中*抽象*出了一个“苹果”的概念。这也是*恒常*。这个“*理想的‘苹果’*”，或者说，这个“*形而上的苹果*”，是我们对具体的苹果的*归纳*（*抽象*）[^6]。\n    50→\n    51→我们把这两种恒常叫做*第〇种形而上*。\n    52→\n    53→#### *第一种*：经验的预测\n    54→\n    55→*第一种形而上*必须要基于*第〇种形而上*。他是基于*第〇种形而上*之上的*恒常*：总是发生的事情（大概率）会（在未来或者空间中）**重复**发生[^7]。\n    56→\n    57→例一：我看到了**很多次**苹果树上结苹果，苹果变大了掉下来。所以我认为苹果树**以后**也会**重复**地结苹果，他结的苹果**以后**也会**重复**地掉下来——是为*恒常*。\n    58→\n    59→例二：李四**每次**用我的东西都会送回来，张三**每次**用我的东西都大多自己拿走了。所以我认为，**以后**李四用我的东西也**都**会送回来，张三**以后**用我的东西也**都**大多自己拿走了——是为*恒常*。\n    60→\n    61→#### *第二种*：经验的抽象\n    62→\n    63→我们将第一种形而上*归纳*，*抽象*为一种概念，例如“*诚信*”——是为*恒常*。\n    64→\n    65→我们注意到，*第〇、一、二种形而上*，都是同样的两步过程：对**重复**事物的认知（这种认知是*恒常*的，因其认知正在于其**重复**）[^8]，然后将这种认知抽象理解，**固定**为一个（*形而上*）*概念*（这个*概念*是*恒常*的，因其已经**脱离***现象*而恒在）[^9]。第一步既是*第一种形而上*，第二步既是*第二种形而上*。\n    66→\n    67→所谓*第〇种*，其实只是*第一种*（步）和*第二种*（步）最简单（trivial）和基础（fundamental）的形式。第〇种更强调的是其原材料**全部**来自于（“原始的”）*现象* [^10]，而*第一二种*中，其原材料除了来自于（“原始的”）*现象*，也来自于已有的*概念*（*形而上*）[^11]。\n    68→\n    69→注意到，这种“*归纳*”，是**合**，也是**分**。他界定了什么是**同一个**东西/概念——于是也界定了哪些**不是同一种**东西/概念。\n    70→\n    71→#### *第三种*：抽象的组合\n    72→\n    73→*第三种形而上*，便是对*第二种形而上*的理解。他**连接**不同的*形而上*，又自*形而上*而产生*形而上*——也就是说，他是对已有*形而上*的一种**形式化**，因此他可能是一种**框架**、一种**价值**。\n    74→\n    75→---- \n    76→\n    77→注意到，我们提到了两种形而上的“理解”。第一种是自下而上的，例如形式为*归纳*的理解：我们看到了高楼林立，因此我们把高楼林立的地方归纳为城市。另一方面，则是自上而下的，形式为*定义*的理解：我们认为城市**应当**是高楼林立的。甚至我们可以通过再其上的形而上（*第三种*），重新定义城市，再要求具体的城市具有哪些功能和特征。这也是自上而下的。有了实践作为桥梁，自下而上将会影响到自上而下，而自上而下也会影响到自下而上。因而最终上述几种形而上会夹杂在一起[^12]。\n    78→\n    79→### 客观世界\n    80→\n    81→*客观世界*是**基于***现象*而提出的一种**模型**。按照本篇中的定义，所谓“*客观世界*”，既是由*第二实在*所构成的“世界”。即是说，我们认识中的*客观世界*，是以*现象*，既*第一实在*，为**基础**，所**生成**的对*现象*其本身的**解释**。在这个解释之中，**形式上**是由*客观世界*生成了被我们所观测到的世界，也就是*现象*。\n    82→\n    83→**形式上**，倘若一开始没有任何东西，那么**先**存在一个**真正的***客观世界*，和**先**存在*现象*，有着巨大的区别（也没有任何区别）。当我们说“**先**存在一个**真正的***客观世界*”时，*现象*是生成的，然后自生成的现象上，生成了**认识中的***客观世界*（而**不**是**真正的***客观世界*）[^13]。当我们说，“**先**存在*现象*”时，就**不**存在**真正的***客观世界*，只存在“**真正的**

   86→\n    87→\n    88→#### 附录：关于本篇中“形而上”一词的一点说明\n    89→\n    90→“形而上学”一词，乃是自英文“metaphysics”翻译而来。其中，“形而上”，取自《易经系辞传》第八章第五节：\n    91→\n    92→> 是故形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器，化而裁之谓之变，推而行之谓之通，举而措之天下之民，谓之事业。\n    93→\n    94→在本片文章中，对将形解为“现象”。现象是一切的基础，因而是最下者。因此这种解释有异于系辞传中“形”的本意。如果要一一对应，还是以苹果为例子，那么系辞传中的形对应于本篇中的“理想中的‘苹果’”，器对应于对应于*第二实在*的苹果。\n    95→\n    96→## 前形而上学的讨论\n    97→\n    98→一般认为，形而上学的末路是*虚无主义*。\n    99→\n   100→在我看来，形而上学的发展有其脉络。其脉络既是对于终极实在的层层回避，步步后退，而向着实用性逐渐靠近的过程。因为愈探求，愈不可探求，因为“事实上并不存在这样的终极实在可以背触及”。随着“最高价值”（既“终极实在”）的丧失，形而上学的大厦自然地倒塌，留下的遗迹被称之为虚无主义。虚无主义不是一种有、一种主义，而是一种无，一种缺位。虚无主义不是被生产、创造出来的，正如虚空并不是被生产创造出来的，而是因为没有生产和创造了，这里什么都没有而已。\n   101→\n   102→但是，注意到，虚无主义中的大部分议题实际上是**非理性**的。\n   103→\n   104→### 非理性\n   105→\n   106→显然的，理性的目的必然要在理性之外[^23]，所以，理性的目的必然是非理性的——也就是说，理性仅仅作为一种工具而存在。\n   107→\n   108→因此我们自然的知道，**对*终极实在*的追求本身就是非理性的**（形而上学本身就是非理性的）。因此，虚无主义之所以能够被提出来（虚无主义之所以是虚无**主义**、之所以使得“没有终极实在”成为一种议题）的原因也是**非理性**的。\n   109→\n   110→而形而上学和虚无主义之所以是非理性的原因，是因为我们对*形而上*的**追求**是非理性的。因为倘若不存在任何的形而上，那么我们面对现象就没有任何“抓手”——我们就无法（对于我们而言）有意义的作出任何行为[^19]。也就是说，我们（看似理性的）对*形而上*的**追求**其实就是我们**非理性**的对*恒常性*的追求。而这种**非理性**是应当被**承认**的[^20]。因为这种非理性所造成的结果既是使得理想和现象重叠，使得我们能够（似乎是主观的）作出任何（有主观意义上的结果的）实践。\n   111→\n   112→这种非理性的由来，在追求恒常性之上，我认为还有一层，即是我们需要这种“实践”。这种理想和现象的重叠，既是“自我实现”（Self Realization，使得自我得以成为现实）——我们在现象中看到我们自身，证实我的存在，使得现象成为“我的一部分”（籍于理想和现象的重叠，我们在现象中重现了我的理想）。\n   113→\n   114→## 后形而上学\n   115→\n   116→后形而上学，必然是虚无主义之后才可以产生的形而上学。以我所见，所谓后形而上学，既是以现象为核心，承认所有形而上皆为现象之上的构造的形而上学。因此，其必须时时刻刻认识到，任何的形而上仅仅是对形的描述和建模——因此其方法论的核心必然要将形而上和现象紧密的联系在一起。因此我所见到的大道既是前述的“理想和现象之重叠”——实践。\n   117→\n   118→*后形而上学*，同*前形而上学*一样，是一种*形式化*的*形而上*（即 *第三种形而上*）。与*前形而上学*的区别在于，后形而上学对“价值”、“意义”、“本质”一类的*第〇实在*进行了祛魅：认识到对这些概念的追求来源于一种*非理性*。这一认知立刻自然导致了如下改变：\n   119→1. *第〇实在*不再具有特殊的位置，因为其特殊位置是由*非理性*给定的（直到我们理性的给定这样一个人造的目的为止，但是此时任何*形而上*都可以被如此给定）。\n   120→2. *现象*现在被放到了特殊的位置[^21]。我们意识到任何的*形而上*仅仅是对*现象|形*的描述和建模。\n   121→\n   122→这些改变使得我们需要重申如下结果：\n   123→1. 再次强调，*后形而上学*是形式化的*形而上*。\n   124→2. 在整个形式化体系中，*非理性*得到了承认。这一承认在认识上有两点：承认其（不可避免的）存在、和承认其效果（如承认人对*形而上*的追求）。这两点都我们作为人进行*形而上*的结果[^22]。\n   125→3. *后形而上学*，作为一种*形而上*，具有一种功能性：理想和现象之重叠——*实践*。这一功能性同时具有*非理性*层面上的目的性。\n   126→\n   127→----\n   128→\n   129→请读者移步至《[[形而上学后的目的：诗意]]》文章继续关于后形而上学的探讨。\n   130→\n   131→\n

136→[^3]:\t仁义礼实则是已经是一套形而上的框架了。而我们又不得不借助一些框架来描述现象，因而即便我极力尝试还原其作为现象的本来面貌，但是其仍旧是失准的。中国哲学常将仁义并提。所谓仁，是谓爱人。所谓义，是谓应当。按照形式上的理解，以爱父亲这一仁来举例。我爱我的父亲所应当做的，就是义。而这个义的具体行为，则是礼。因而义是连接仁和具体行为（礼）的那个东西。在现象上，我这里用现象仁来描述我内心对我父亲的某种（爱的）感受，这个感受使得（推动）我去做一些行为。那么这种推动力，这种“motivation”本身，就是连接我的这种感受（现象仁）和我的这种行为（现象礼）的东西，因而把它叫做现象义是合适的。\n

142→[^6]:\t在本篇文章中，归纳和抽象似乎常常混用，因而在此作出一些解释。抽象和抽象都可以理解为从材料中略去部分特定的细节，选中某些选定的共性，而生成一个概念（形而上）的过程。但是其强调的方面有所不同。归纳强调归类（选定共性），而抽象强调生成（生成形而上）。\n   143→\n   144→[^7]:\t这里的恒常和第〇种中介绍的恒常没有区别。\n   145→\n

155→\n   156→[^13]:\t而**认识中的***客观世界*也并不是对**真正的***客观世界*的拟合，而是对*现象*的拟合（以期望达成对**真正的***客观世界*的拟合）。\n   157→\n   158→[^14]:\t因为对于我们而言现象已经是最下者。\n   159→\n   160→[^15]:\t这个逻辑和先前讨论的*道*是相同的。在形式上，是*道*生万物，然而事实上，*道*才是被生成的。因此，**形式上**，倘若真的有真正的*道*，既*第〇实在*（或者更下），当他被提出就成为了*第二实在*（或者更上），因而真正的*道*不可道不可名，无可讨论无法提出。\n   161→\n   162→[^19]:\t假设**我**是有（理性和非理性的）目的性的。那么如果我**完全**不知道做一件事情的后果，那么做不做这件事情**对我而言**就没有区别。就像是拿手指在波涛汹涌的海洋（现象）中随手搅拌一样。\n   163→\n   164→[^20]:\t这种承认是出于一种目的而承认的。\n   165→\n   166→[^21]:\t这是基于我们（作为人）的认知而导致的。\n

此处需要注意，更加符合道家的关于“道”的解释更类似于使得存在得以成立的那个东西。形象地说，就像是对于一幅画而言的画纸一样。在这里，我们仅仅是结构上表达可以认为“道”决定和产生了“德”。\n   173→\n   174→[^25]:

我铺开羊皮纸，开始撰写我新的魔法书。让我看看之前这本书上开头的两个魔法……哦！是*猫猫*变狗术和**鸭鸭**变狗术。哼……多么的简单！我挥动羽毛笔，写下了——*猫猫*和**鸭鸭**都变狗狗术！这可是在之前的这本书上都没有的全新魔法！（因为之前书上的魔法并没有作用于两个动物身上都有效的魔法）如此简单的任务真是令我发笑！我如法炮制，迅速的写完了这本魔法书——《复合动物变形指南——一年级》（$\\mathcal

**猪猪鼠鼠**全都变成狗狗术”！我如法炮制……迅速的写完了这本魔法书——《复合动物变形指南——二年级》，把他放在了《复合动物变形指南——一年级》的旁边。（$\\mathcal T_2$是两册书一起。那些出现在第二册中的魔法的绝对元阶为2。出现在第一册中的魔法的绝对元阶为1。）\n   126→3. 我按照这样的摸鱼方法，开始继续写下一本书。当然！我每次的新书都会参考我从一年级开始的所有书！这能大大提高摸鱼效率。比如说在第一本书里我写过了“*猫猫和鸭鸭*都变狗狗术”，在第二本书里我写过了\"**狮狮虎虎蛙蛙獭獭**全都变成狗狗术\"，那我自然要在第三本里写下“*猫猫鸭鸭* **狮狮虎虎蛙蛙獭獭**大变狗狗术”！。\n   127→4. 如此简单的任务！在那一个下午，我按照相同的套路，摸鱼了——几乎无数本魔法书！\n   128→\n   129→注意到该魔法教授构造新一元阶魔法的方法将会使得在最后一本魔法书中，将有可能包含将所有动物都变成绵羊的真正终极变羊术。但是不会包含把所有动物都变成狗的真正终极变狗术，因为狗在$\\mathcal O$中不是一个终对象。也就是说我们可以推断在这些书当中不存在把羊变成狗的魔法，但是却必然存在把狗变成羊的魔法。\n   130→\n   131→注意到，本质上来说，“*猫猫*和**鸭鸭**都变狗狗术”是为了帮助读者直觉上去理解高阶射态，他实际上是一个把“*猫猫*变狗术”和“**鸭鸭**变狗术”相互转换的魔法。有了这一魔法后，我们自然可以创造一个新的魔法：把“‘*猫猫*变狗’和‘**鸭鸭**变狗’相互转换术”和“*猫猫*变狗术”（或者“**鸭鸭**变狗术”）相互“加”在一起，得到一个“*猫猫*和**鸭鸭**都变狗狗术”。这个“*猫猫*和**鸭鸭**都变狗狗术”和“‘*猫猫*变狗’‘**鸭鸭**变狗’相互转换术’”具有相同的结构，因为每一个“‘*猫猫*变狗’和‘**鸭鸭**变狗’相互转换术”都可以找到一个唯一的“*猫猫*和**鸭鸭**都变狗狗术”。\n

World（物质世界），或者是Physics（物理法则）。我用P以指代是任何在某理论中被认为是第一实在的东西（例如说，一些人可能会认为P除了物质世界之外，还应当加上（客观的）Spirit World（精神世界）。\n   147→\n   148→本文中，P最终应当指代现象（Phenomenon）。并且我将用“感受”和“体验”一词以指代P中的任何一个部分。其原因在于，即便对于客观世界模型来说，任何对于我们有影响的事物都必须通过“感受”或者“体验”以“进入”我们的“视野”以成为“现象”。因此“全部的感受之总和”既是现象。\n   149→\n   150→在本文中，我将用$\\mathfrak P$以指代完整的P，即是“全部的感受之总和”、完整的现象，而用$\\mathfrak p$以指代某部分的P，例如“所有我从手机中所接受到的信息”。\n   151→\n   152→### E\n   153→\n   154→以P为范例，在这里，我拟用代号E（$\\mathbb E$或$\\mathcal

P$的一部分。例如$\\mathfrak p$，并构造$\\mathfrak p$上的结构$\\mathcal E_\\mathfrak p$。此后我将使用$\\mathcal E$指代$\\mathbb E$或者某些$\\mathfrak p$上的$\\mathcal E_\\mathfrak p$。\n   161→\n   162→注意到，$\\mathcal E$中的态射也是$\\mathfrak P$中的部分（即感受），因此即是说，$\\mathcal E$当中的态射也是$\\mathcal E$中的对象，因此我们可以断言$\\mathcal E$的结构是塔式结构。\n   163→\n   164→注意到，你可以通过内省来**体验**和**验证**这个结构$\\mathcal E$。也就是说，如果想要获取某一个特定的感受$a$，可以以$\\mathcal E$中$a$所处的结构位置作为地图去唤醒这个特定的感受。\n   165→\n   166→#### 附言\n   167→\n   168→值得注意的是，一个更加恰当的描述是使用*纯态射范畴*（arrows-only metacategory）。通过将单位元和其对应对象等同，两者构成相同的数学结构。为了方便理解，这里继续使用常见的范畴的语言。\n   169→\n   170→在数学上，可以认为$\\mathfrak P$是某种意义上在范畴论中常使用的\"universe\"或者Large Categories，不过其边界被限定为给定的P。某种意义上，$\\mathcal E$是对$\\mathfrak P$这种“无结构的大集类”中元素的选取。选取所构成的$\\mathcal E$作为塔式结构中的对象和射态具有相同的地位（正如$\\mathfrak P$中并不区分对象和射态）。通过塔式构造重构$\\mathcal E$即是通过赋予元阶，对塔式结构$\\mathcal E$中的对象赋予了分层结构的过程。这一点将在后续讨论到。\n   171→\n   172→## 形而上：A1策略\n   173→\n   174→A1策略是使用范畴论描述境的一个尝试。\n   175→\n   176→### 联想和形而上\n   177→\n   178→$\\mathcal E$中的态射，如前所述，被称之为联想。例如说，我看到铅笔而想到钢笔，因而联想，做为一个态射，链接了铅笔和钢笔。与此同时，这一联想也作为一个对象而存在于$\\mathcal E$中，即是那个我看到铅笔而想到钢笔的那种“感受”。这种感受可能源于铅笔和钢笔当中的某种**相似性**（一般由感官的模糊性导致）。在这种情况下，遵照先前的魔法书例子，我们可以将许多种**类似**的对象（例如蜡笔、粉笔）和他们两两之间的联想当作是$\\mathcal E$中某种构造中的$\\mathcal T_1$（或者说，我们将这些对象选择作为基石），那么必然在$\\mathcal T_\\infty$中存在某种“终极联想”，即终对象，这个终对象的一个表示即是那种感觉，那种我看到这些**类似**的东西都会感受到的那种感觉（而这种感觉在这种状况下意味着某种终极的**相似性**）——我们把这个感觉叫做*笔*。\n   179→\n   180→注意到，*笔*这一概念是一种对具体的、个别的笔（例如铅笔、或者例如这支我拿在手上的笔）的*形而上*。推而广之，我们给出*形而上*的如下定义：\n   181→\n   182→> 一个*形而上*$m$是$\\mathcal E$中的联想，且$m$在$\\mathcal E$的某个子范畴中是范性质。我们将这个子范畴记作$\\mathcal E_m$，简记成$\\mathcal M$。\n   183→\n   184→注意到，不是所有子范畴内都存在范性质。\n   185→\n   186→#### 例子：忒修斯之船\n   187→\n   188→什么是忒修斯之船（忒修斯之船的本质是什么）？忒修斯之船即是那个我们看到任意的“忒修斯之船的碎片或关联物”（如船的部件）都会联想到的东西（体验）、或是当我们提到时会联想到所有的“忒修斯之船的碎片或关联物”的那个东西（体验）。也就是说，他是某一个体验（$\\mathfrak p_{Theseus}$中的一部分），某一个和这艘船（$\\mathfrak p_{\\text{Theseus}}$中的一部分）上的所有部件都相关的体验。这个特定的体验即是关于忒修斯之船 的$\\mathcal E_{\\text{Theseus}}$的泛性质，是当我们提到忒修斯之船时的“本质”。\n   189→\n   190→如果我们将物理世界作为$\\mathfrak P$，我们可以定义物质意义上的$\\mathcal E$。此时$\\mathcal E$当中的全部对象即是任意忒修斯之船的部分（例如说甲板，和甲板上的这一块和那一块木板，和船舵）。注意到，此时空总是$\\mathcal E$中的对象，也是他的子范畴中的对象。我们不妨将包含关系当作$\\mathcal E$上的态射（他作为对象是什么？），那么此时，_忒修斯之船_（我在这里使用了简记，用*忒修斯之船*以指代$\\mathcal E_{\\text{Theseus}}$）的范性质有两种：始对象即是完整的忒修斯之船（包含了任何一个对象）、终对象即是空（被任何对象所包含）。因此，在如此选定的$\\mathfrak P$上，我们必然会出现忒修斯悖论：\n   191→\n   192→> 如果忒修斯的船上的木头逐渐被替换，直到所有的木头都不是原来的木头，那这艘船还是原来的那艘船吗？\n   193→\n   194→并且我们会得到忒修斯之船的本质即是无这样的谬论——因为无确实是*忒修斯之船*的范性质。这一悖论的原因即是我们对$\\mathfrak P$的错误选取——$\\mathfrak P$应当被选择为现象而非物理世界，因为*忒修斯之船*之形而上并不存在于物理世界，而存在于我们的脑海之中。\n   195→\n   196→同样的，我们注意到，当我们选取$\\mathfrak P$为现象时，$\\mathcal E$上的态射不应单独的选择为包含关系。例如说，当我们追问我是谁的时候，我们常常把自己的特征去掉（如果我不会弹钢琴了，我还是我么？），直至最后得到了“空”这样的答案。倘若以范性质以描述我，“我”是那个感受，那个当你提到任何有关我的方面时，都会让我联想到的那个感受，这个感受即是我。\n   197→\n   198→练习：试分析秃头悖论：当一个人少了多少根头发，我们会认为他秃了？\n   199→\n   200→#### 例子：什么是人？\n   201→\n   202→另外一个例子是“什么是人”。“人”即是当你看到所有你认为是人的时候所想到的，感受到的那个感觉，那个感觉就告诉了你什么是“人”。\n   203→\n   204→但是我们常常还会想要一些更多关于我们认为什么是“人”的信息。那么我们自然可以探索，在以这个感觉作为范性质（形而上）的子范畴中，那些元阶介于这一感觉和看到具体的人之间的那些感受和东西，例如说，有什么样的手、有什么样的脸、有什么样的社会性，等等。\n   205→\n   206→要注意到，这一回答不是本体论的回答，而是实践上的回答：这就是我们在描述我们所认为的“什么是人”的时候唯一能做的事情，正如当小孩问他们的父母，“什么是人？”时，他的父母唯一能做的一样。\n   207→\n   208→#### 例子：对象化（Objectification）\n   209→\n   210→当工人创造其工作成果时，这一行为有时会用对象化一词来形容。有的时候，工人的劳动成果被看作是工人的“我”的一部分。在这个时候，所谓“我的一部分”，其意义在于生产成果是工人认识自身的一种途径：人在劳动成果中“认出自己”，由此，成果不仅属于人，而且是人的延伸，构成人的“现实的我”。\n   211→\n   212→我们在这里提出一种新的，类似的对象化。回想，按照我们的定义：\n   213→\n   214→> “我”是那个感受，那个当你提到任何有关我的方面时，都会让我联想到的那个感受，这个感受即是我。\n   215→\n   216→当工人看到自己的产品时，会感受到这个东西其中自己倾注其中的具体工作和努力，由此会体验和联想到“我”的感受。正如当我们想到我们的身体时，激活了“我”的感受一样，这个产品也成为了“我”的一部分，加入了以“我”作为范性质（形而上）的子范畴中。\n   217→\n   218→### 元阶？\n   219→\n   220→我们注意到，$\\mathcal E$是$\\mathfrak p$上的结构，即是说，$\\mathcal E$是描述性的，是一种对$\\mathfrak p$的理解，而非构造性的，一种对$\\mathfrak p$的定义。也就是说，我们所面对的$\\mathcal E$（几乎）是不区分元阶的。请看如下例子：\n   221→\n   222→#### 例子：龙血\n   223→\n   224→>生活在魔法之都的约翰出生于炼金世家，从小他就对各种炼金原料了如指掌：例如说人血和龙血。在他的眼中，人血就是人的血、而龙血就是龙的血。他们都是血，只是从不同的生物身上得道而已。\n   225→\n   226→我们可以说，人、龙、血对于约翰都是同一元阶的，倘若我们将人、龙、血，作为基石，那么显然，人、龙、血都是1元阶对象；而人血和龙血则都是2元阶对象。\n   227→\n   228→>在遥远的北方，有着一座被巨龙统治的小镇。卢克打小就生活在此，在他的印象中，龙是不可战胜，无可损伤的，然而在龙的压迫下，镇民的生活一日不如一日，反抗的低语此起彼伏，但是却没有人胆敢攻击那无可战胜的龙。然而，卢克有一日却忽然意识到——他从未见过龙受过伤……但是龙血应该也是存在的吧？就和人血一样？ （to do：not a good example）\n   229→\n   230→我们可以说，人血、龙对于卢克都是同1元阶的，倘若我们将人血、龙作为基石，那么显然，人血、龙都是1元阶对象；而根据人血和龙而联想到的龙血，则是2元阶对象。\n   231→\n   232→> 在过了许久之后，卢克和镇民们已经成功反抗的龙的统治，用一把黑剑刺入了龙的心脏。在卢克的晚年，龙血对于他而言已经没有什么特别的了。龙血只是龙的血而已，正如人血只是人的血而已，龙和人一样，都只是会受伤的生物罢了。\n   233→\n   234→我们可以说，此时，人、龙、血对于卢克都是同一元阶的，倘若我们将人、龙、血，作为基石，那么显然，人、龙、血都是1元阶对象；而人血和龙血则都是2元阶对象。\n   235→\n   236→----\n   237→\n   238→为什么会产生这种无法区分元阶的情况呢？其原因在于元阶的定义依赖于第一章所介绍的构造方法，$\\mathcal T_n$总是由$\\mathcal T_{n-1}$所*生成*的，给定某种构造，我们才可以定义元阶——或者说，当我们给对象指定元阶时，我们就确定了一组特定的构造方法。但是$\\mathcal E$本身并不是被构造出来的，**$\\mathcal E$是$\\mathfrak p$上的结构**，而不是$\\mathfrak p$是$\\mathcal E$的结果。\n   239→\n   240→我们并不能够直接说*笔*的概念生成了*铅笔*，因为我们可能先知道了铅笔，然后将许多笔抽象，得到了笔的概念，我们也不能够直接说*铅笔*的概念生成了*笔*，因为可能我之前见过许多笔，有了笔的概念，但是却没有见到过铅笔，于是用*笔*的概念想到了一种特别的用石墨做芯的笔（也就是铅笔）。\n   241→\n   242→###  构造（Construction）和形而上学\n   243→\n

8→\n     9→这篇文章是为了记录想法， 于仓促间写就，因而没有为阅读体验做过额外打磨，许多技术性的地方还没有像《范畴论与境》中那样给出贴近生活的例子，阅读节奏也比较凌乱。所以对于过于技术性的部分，如果读者感到困难，可以暂时跳过。\n    10→\n    11→## 函子\n    12→\n    13→由于本篇文章是快速记录，我们略过函子的定义。总而言之，一个从范畴C到D的函子把C中的对象映射到D中的对象，把C中的射态映射到D中的射态。并且保持单位元，而且射态的组合在映射前进行和在映射后进行没有差别。\n    14→\n    15→## K1形式\n    16→\n    17→我们定义演化函子 $T$ 和转换函子 $F$。\n    18→\n    19→$$\n    20→T_t: \\mathbb{E}_t \\to \\mathbb{E}_{t+1}\n    21→$$\n    22→这里的 $\\mathbb{E}$ 是境，$\\mathbb{E}_t$可以理解为在某一个特定的思想状态下那个特定的境，这个 $T$ 是境的演化函子，$t$ 不一定是物理时间，只是某种 label，他可以是物理时间，也可以是某种心理时间或者其他的东西。如果$t$是物理时间，那么$\\mathbb{E}_t$可以理解为在某一个瞬间一个人的境。虽然$t$ 不一定是物理时间，在接下来我将会用“时刻”指代某一特定的$t$。为了简便，$t$在这里我们将其取离散值。\n    23→\n    24→接下来，我们将定义一系列的转换函子，并以其引出数个$\\mathbb{E}_t$的子范畴（境）。\n    25→\n    26→首先，我们可以从$\\mathbb{E}_t$中“抽取”出一些特定的境：\n    27→$$\n    28→(F_{E,L})_t: (\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\to \\mathbb{E}_t\n    29→$$\n

  35→$$\n    36→其中 $(\\mathcal{E}_M)_t$ 是主观时刻 $t$ 下的数学结构范畴。\n    37→\n    38→类似地，可以定义：\n    39→$$\n    40→(F_{E,M})_t: (\\mathcal{E}_M)_t \\to \\mathbb{E}_t\n    41→$$\n    42→\n    43→我们还可以定义某种跨演化的境，例如说，我们可以构造一种“通用的”语言范畴：\n    44→$$\n    45→(F_{L})_t: (\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\to \\mathcal{E}_L\n    46→$$\n    47→其中 $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$ 是语言范畴 $\\mathcal{E}_L$ 的子范畴。数学部分类似地有：\n    48→$$\n    49→(F_{M})_t: (\\mathcal{E}_M)_t \\to \\mathcal{E}_M\n    50→$$\n    51→\n    52→注意到，本节中的定义仅仅是一种描述（建模）的尝试，也仅仅只是一种选择。例如说，或许相较与离散的实践变换，一种更连续的变换在一些方面会更有优势。\n    53→\n    54→## K1策略：$\\mathbb E_t$的某种稳定结构\n    55→\n    56→接下来，我们做出一个猜想：在 $T$ 函子的演化中，例如从演化 $\\mathbb{E}_{t_a}\\to\\mathbb{E}_{t_a+1}\\to\\cdots\\mathbb{E}_{t_b-1}\\to\\mathbb{E}_{t_b}$ 中，应该存在某种稳定结构（不知道是什么结构）被保持在每一个$\\mathbb{E}_{t_i}$中，我们暂把其写作$S_E$，并且这个结构具有某种不变性。也就是说，这种不变性在 $T$ 中以某种方式是可以被识别出来的，因为$T$保持他。虽然我们可能很难找到它。\n    57→\n    58→倘若包含在上述演化中的某一个时刻$t_c$所对应的$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$是所有$\\mathbb E_{t}$当中拥有对象最少的（或许这是人一生中的某一个极早时刻），那么这意味着这一稳定结构至多即是某个$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$中的稳定结构，我们把在这种选择下的稳定结构写作$S_{E_c}$。如果你认为这一时刻是某种$\\mathbb E_t$首次出现的时刻，因此有可能独立于经验与感官印象，则你可以将这种稳定结构当中的这一部分认定为“先天”。进一步的，如果你认为$\\mathbb{E}$表示了某种认知，那么假如能够证明这一稳定结构当中的一部分一旦缺失，则无法从$\\mathfrak P_t$中构建任何$\\mathbb{E}_{t}$，则可以将这部分稳定结构称之为“认知结构”。由此，这意味着，在一些哲学框架下，这一稳定结构当中的一部分即有可能是“先天认知结构”[^1]。倘若我们更加平凡的选取$t_a$和$t_b$，不要求演化中包含这样特定的$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$，我们则可以寻找到到更大的和不同的$S_E$，其中则可能除了$S_{E_c}$之外还有其他的（但可能与之相关的）稳定结构，在一些哲学框架下，这些稳定结构可以被认为是后天构建的认知框架。\n    59→\n    60→进一步，在 $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$ 的演化中也应该存在某种稳定结构，这种结构就是我们平时所说的“限定语法规则”之类的东西。\n    61→\n    62→我们已经知道，直接研究 $\\mathbb{E}_t$ 以及 $T_t$ 的演化是困难的。但是我们已经有了函子：\n    63→$$\n    64→(F_{E,L})_t: (\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\to \\mathbb{E}_t\n    65→$$\n    66→这样，我们就可以设想存在某种稳定结构 $S_L$ 在 $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$ 中稳定出现，同时存在某种结构 $S_E$ 在 $\\mathbb{E}_t$ 中保持稳定。通过 $(F_{E,L})_t$（或者某种其他的$(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\to \\mathbb{E}_t$的函子，例如针对某句特定的话内省，当我们看到一句话时其导致我们内心的反应），我们就有可能可以建立一个结构之间的映射关系去至少部分的获取有关 $S_E$ 的信息：\n    67→$$\n    68→(F_{E,L})_t(S_L) \\approx S_E\n    69→$$\n    70→于是我们就可以通过语言游戏研究语言演化中的稳定结构 $S_L$，来间接获得对 $\\mathbb{E}_t$ 中 $S_E$ 的认识，也就是明晰他在感受的范畴之中和其他感受的联系。我们的核心假设是$(F_{E,L})_t(S_L)$和$S_E$至少有一部分重叠。\n    71→\n    72→虽然在这里我们以语言游戏为例，在更好的情况下，我们可以对数个不同的境，例如 $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$ 和 $(\\mathcal{E}_M)_t$等等进行这样的操作，那么通过他们的集合$\\{(F_{E,i})_t(S_i)\\}_i$，我们将能够或许有机会进一步接近$S_E$。事实上，如果我有两个能够以某种形式化的方法（在这里我们的选择是范畴论）去描述的境$(\\mathcal{E}_A)_t$和$(\\mathcal{E}_B)_t$，并且我能够将其中的对象在两个境内进行转换，也就是存在某种$(F_{A \\to B})_t$或者$(F_{B \\to A})_t$，那么，我们之后将会论证，这样的$(F_{A \\to B})_t$必然需要途径$\\mathbb E_t$而捕捉到一部分$\\mathbb E_t$当中到稳定结构。也就是$\\mathbb E_t$中必然存在某些“可被多种形式系统共同描述”的结构，因而这部分稳定结构必然可以用某种形式化的方法（在这里是范畴论）描述。\n    73→\n    74→除了针对$S_E$，我们也可以对其他的存在于$\\mathbb E_t$中的某些结构做类似的研究。这也同时给出了为什么语言游戏作为哲学治疗是有效的，并且将其扩展到其他非语言的境中。\n    75→\n    76→注意到，这里的稳定结构仅仅是描述性的，并且在一些场景下可能具有一定的实用性，但他是否具有某种形而上意义，是否到来某种价值论，例如是否应当追求他，在此我们并未得出结论。\n    77→\n    78→## K1策略：知识的发生\n    79→\n    80→本章节的目的，在于描述语言本身的结构，如何逼迫知识结构的形成。也就是说，某些语言形式似乎强制性地要求我们建立某种特定的“信念–证实”网络， 语言不是只是表达已知知识，而是一种知识验证框架，甚至反向促成了知识结构的构建。一些语句试图“拉出”一组态射，或者指出其断裂：语言行为（如对话、辩护、叙事）要求我们给出论证关系，于是我们开始构造知识结构本身。\n    81→\n    82→接下来考虑$(\\mathcal E_K)_t$，即某一时刻的知识结构。一个形象的理解是其中的对象为信念，射态为证实关系（注意证实关系是一种信念，即是我们认可什么样的论证方式）。我们可以类似$(\\mathcal E_ L)_t$的构造相关的射态和$\\mathcal E_L$。尤为重要的是，存在某种函子\n    83→$$\n    84→(F_{L \\to K})_t: (\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\to (\\mathcal{E}_K)_t\n    85→$$\n    86→即是某一些语句，可以对应某一存在于知识网络中的信念。因为这两个范畴都存在于$\\mathbb E_t$中，因此函子本身作为高阶射态也可以存在于$\\mathbb E_t$中（因为境是塔式结构）。幸运的是，这一函子对于许多人来说恰好确实存在。我们可以通过自省来验证该函子的存在：当我们阅读某句话时，是否能够感受到思想内关于这句话所描述信念的存在，并且确认这一信念在知识网络中的位置：他会令自己联想到哪些其他的信念。\n    87→\n    88→接下来，我们考虑如下过程，通过玩语言游戏，我们构造了在$(\\mathcal{E}_L)_{t}$中的新语句$a$。我们马上可以自省以使用$(F_{L \\to K})_t$将该语句映射为一信念，并在接下来的时刻（$t'$之前）尝试构建知识网络。我们注意到，类似于$(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$，$(\\mathcal E_K)_t$有其内部的某种稳定结构$S_L$，这一稳定结构可以由$(\\mathcal E_K)_t$的演化中识别。而“将该语句映射为一信念并尝试构建知识网络”就是知识范畴的演化过程。根据是否能保持这一特定的稳定结构，$a$所对应的信念将被接受或者拒绝，两种情况都将导致$(\\mathcal E_K)_t$演化为$(\\mathcal E_K)_{t'}$，并且他可能等同或者不等同于$(\\mathcal E_K)_t$（也就是说，即便拒绝，演化后的知识网络不包含$a$所对应的信念，这一演化过程也可能对知识网络产生扰动）。当$a$对应的信念成为$(\\mathcal E_K)_{t'}$的对象时，知识就发生了。\n    89→\n    90→在这一过程中，有两个地方有可能会使用到$\\mathbb{E}_t$中的稳定结构$S_E$。首先，函子$(F_{L \\to K})_t$有可能是通过函子$(F_{E,L})_t$和$(F_{E,K})_t$构建的，例如：\n    91→$$\n    92→(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,L})_t} \\mathbb{E}_t \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,K})_t^{-1}} (\\mathcal{E}_K)_t\n    93→$$\n    94→由此在$(F_{L \\to K})_t$的过程中，由于上一章节的原因，使用（途经/穿过）了$\\mathbb{E}_t$中的$S_E$。或者，函子$(F_{L \\to K})_t$需要通过$\\mathbb{E}_{t}$的演化来生成新的信念感受$a$，然后尝试将其加入知识网络，也就是说，我们可以把$(F_{L \\to K})_t$定义为\n    95→$$\n    96→(F_{L \\to K})_t=(F_{E,K})_{t+1}^{-1} \\circ T_t \\circ (F_{E,L})_t\n    97→$$\n    98→这里使用$\\circ$表示函子的组合以防止歧义。用另一种表达方式，我们可以说：\n    99→$$\n   100→(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,L})_t} \\mathbb{E}_{t+1} \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,K})_{t+1}^{-1}} (\\mathcal{E}_K)_{t+2}\n   101→$$\n   102→此时应当将$(F_{L \\to K})_t$认为是某种特定的开始于时刻$t$的内省过程，并且此处$(F_{E,L})_t$是$T_t$的限制（restriction，可以理解为“子函子”：$(F_{E,L})_t=T_t|_{(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t}$）。不论采用哪种记号，都在$(F_{L \\to K})_t$中都有演化过程，其中可以识别出$S_E$。其次，$(\\mathcal E_K)_t$的演化，遵照上一章节的描述，其内部的特定稳定结构应当可以构成同$S_E$的函子。\n   103→\n   104→最后，这意味着我们可以通过玩语言游戏明晰$S_K$。\n   105→\n   106→## 策略K1：自然变换\n   107→\n   108→我们接下里考虑观察到的他人、语言、数学等对感受到影响。接下来，我将先用数学语言进行描述，然后根据在K1形式中的定义进行解释。我们以数学为例，考虑以下两条路径从 $(\\mathcal{E}_M)_t$ 到 $\\mathbb{E}_{t+1}$：\n   109→\n   110→1.  \n   111→$$\n   112→(\\mathcal{E}_M)_t \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,M})_t} \\mathbb{E}_t \\xrightarrow{T} \\mathbb{E}_{t+1}\n   113→$$\n   114→\n   115→2.  \n   116→$$\n   117→(\\mathcal{E}_M)_t \\xrightarrow{T_M} (\\mathcal{E}_M)_{t+1} \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,M})_{t+1}} \\mathbb{E}_{t+1}\n   118→$$\n   119→其中$T_M$是某种在数学范畴内的演化。注意到这不立刻意味着$T_M$是$T$的限制。\n   120→\n   121→我们可以猜测，存在自然变换：\n   122→$$\n   123→T \\circ (F_{E, M})_t\\Rightarrow(F_{E,M})_{t+1} \\circ T_M\n   124→$$\n   125→\n   126→它意味着，对于每一个公式$a\\in(\\mathcal{E}_M)_t$，都存在一个射态\n   127→$$\n   128→\\eta_a: T((F_{E,M})_t(a)) \\to (F_{E,M})_{t+1}(T_M(a))\n

135→我们接下来遵照K1形式给出的定义对这两个公式进行解读。\n   136→\n   137→我们首先理解什么是$\\eta_a$。\n   138→$$\n   139→\\eta_a: T((F_{E,M})_t(a)) \\to (F_{E,M})_{t+1}(T_M(a))\n   140→$$\n   141→为了方便理解，让我们使用一个公式$a$的例子：“1+1”$\\xrightarrow{T_M}$“1+1=2”。\n   142→\n   143→注意到，由于$\\eta_a$是$\\mathbb E_t$中的射态，因此它是一种体验。也就是说我们有机会能够通过内省去获得他：\n   144→- 左边（domain）描述当我们看到“1+1”后我们对其进行思考后得到的体验\n   145→- 右边（codomain）描述\"1+1\"遵照数学规律演化为\"1+1=2\"，我们看到了\"1+1=2\"后的体验\n   146→\n   147→也就是说，$\\eta_a$ 是一种在体验中，我们看到 “1+1” 后对其进行思考后所产生的那种感受，与我们看到 “1+1=2” 时所感到的那种感受之间的链接感受。它就像是我们做完一道数学题后，对照参考答案时所经历的那种“确认过程”的体验。我们可以将 $\\eta_a$ 理解为：通过数学结构对思考进行确认的过程，其对应的感受。\n   148→\n   149→特殊地，当 $\\eta_a$ 是单位元时，意味着我们对 “1+1” 的思考结果所带来的感受，与我们直接看到 “1+1=2” 时的感受完全一致，不需要经过任何额外思考来完成确认。就像是我们对照答案时，一眼就意识到自己的解答与参考答案完全一致，不需要任何过程就直接意识到自己脑海当中的推导是对的的那种感觉。是那种无需中介、直接闭合的“直接确认感”。我们可以将这种情况称之为对$a$对掌握。\n   150→\n   151→\n   152→接下来，我们理解自然性条件。\n   153→$$\n   154→(F_{E,M})_{t+1}(T_M(f)) \\circ \\eta_a = \\eta_{a'} \\circ T((F_{E,M})_t(f))\n   155→$$\n   156→我们可以认为$f$为某种联系$a$和$a'$的数学关系（例如由$a$可以推出$a'$），则总的来说\n   157→-

161→为了获得更加直觉的理解，让我们使用两个常见的特例来理解这一公式。首先取$f$为某个固定的可逆的（充分必要的）推导关系，也就是说他在函子$T_M$的演化下不变（即我们不使用数学规律把他变为另一种形式）。此时关于这样的$f$的自然性条件可以化简为\n   162→$$\n   163→\\eta_a = \\hat{f}^{-1}_{t+1} \\circ  \\eta_{a'} \\circ T(\\hat{f}_t) \n   164→$$\n   165→其中 $\\hat{f}_t = (F_{E,M})_t(f)$（即 $f$ 在 $\\mathbb{E}_t$ 中的嵌入），以及 $\\hat{f}_{t+1} = (F_{E,M})_{t+1}(f)$（即 $f$ 在 $\\mathbb{E}_{t+1}$ 中的嵌入）。\n   166→\n   167→如果$T(\\hat f_t)=\\hat f_{t+1}$，则\n   168→$$\n   169→\\eta_a = \\hat{f}^{-1}_{t+1} \\circ  \\eta_{a'} \\circ \\hat{f}_{t+1} \n   170→$$\n   171→此时可以证明$\\eta_a$和$\\eta_{a'}$都必须为单位元。这意味着，如果$a$和$a'$在数学上可以通过某种数学关系相互推导（$f:a\\rightarrow a'$且$f$可逆），并且你能稳定的在脑海中重现这种推导过程（$T(\\hat f_t)=\\hat f_{t+1}$）。那么如果你已经掌握了$a'$，则掌握$a$（即获得对$a$的直接确认感）就需要是\n   172→1. 你把$a$按照你脑海当中的推导过程$f$推导为$a'$，\n   173→2. 无需过程就意识到$a'$是对的，\n   174→3. 然后由$a'$重新推出$a$的过程。\n   175→\n   176→如果我无法通过这一过程获取对$a$的直接确认感，则自然性条件不满足。注意到，最后一步由$a'$重新推出$a$的过程是必要的。因为我们可能会偶然地从不理解的结构推出一个简单结果，但却无法从该结果返回推理出原结构的合理性。在这种情况下，我们并不会感觉我们真正“掌握”了 $a$，因为我们无法从已知结构自然地产生出对它的确认体验。\n   177→\n   178→接下来，如果$f$为某个固定的不可逆的（即充分但不必要的）推导关系，此时自然性条件为\n   179→$$\n   180→\\hat{f}_{t+1} \\circ \\eta_a = \\eta_{a'} \\circ T(\\hat{f}_t)\n   181→$$\n   182→注意此时$\\eta_a$和$\\eta_{a'}$不一定是单位元。如果$T(\\hat

190→我们打一个生活中的比方，想象一个游戏，游戏只有两个选项，选择一项为正确，另一项为错误。如果$a$为游戏攻略中的指南，而$a'$为具体在游戏中的正确操作。如果我能稳定的从指南中描述的游戏玩法推断出具体操作，则\n   191→- 我在玩游戏前游戏攻略确认了玩法，然后在玩的时候从玩法规则在脑内正确的推演了我现在具体要怎么操作\n   192→- 我没有看看游戏攻略确认玩法，直接用印象中的玩法在脑内推演我现在的操作，然后我通过游戏的结果进行确认我的操作\n   193→这两个不同路径能够稳定地达到同样的效果，即是我正确操作并通过了游戏。如果我记错了游戏玩法，那么前者能够通过游戏，而后者则不能；如果游戏在发布攻略后修改了游戏玩法，则前者不能通过游戏，而后者则有可能通过。也就是说，自然性条件可以理解为要求某个范畴的演化和内部感受的演化的一致性：即是说，自然性要求“你以为这个游戏怎么玩”和“这个游戏实际上怎么玩”这两者之间相互契合，这一契合通过对操作结果（作为现象）的确认是否成立，即是否存在$\\eta$，达成。\n   194→\n   195→最后，当$f$在$T_M$下有变换时，类似上面的描述，可以理解为这一变换必须要和我们在脑海中设想的他的变换兼容。\n   196→\n   197→当我们把这一框架使用在语言上，我们可以得到一个经典问题的描述性解答：对于语言来说，是结构先于意义，还是意义先于结构？如果我们认为句子的意义是某一段语言所引发的心理过程，那么我们现在知道，结构和意义之间的关系是自然变换：一句话能够被理解，他必须能够在心理过程的演化和结构的演化中达成如上所述的这种一致性感受$\\eta$，一种对齐。\n   198→- 从语言的角度来说，也就是说如果我们只能改变一个句子的句法结构，那么这个句子要被理解，他必须要“回应”某种给定的心理过程；\n   199→- 从心理的角度来说，也就是说如果我们只能尝试改变自身的心理状态，那么要能读懂一个给定的句子，我们也必须要改变我们的心理状态去“回应”这个句子的结构。\n   200→\n   201→进一步的，我们现在可以做出如下猜测：当你看到一个东西，并且认为你懂这个东西，这意味着这个东西的结构演化与你自身的经验演化之间确立了一个自然变换。形象的说，当你看到“猫跳上了桌子”这句话。这句话在语言中的构造有着固定的演化结构（例如遵照主谓宾的构造方法），而你在逐字阅读这句话的过程（也就是句子演化逐步展开），你在你的脑海中也模拟了这个动作，在脑中看到猫移动、跃起、落到桌上。当这两个演化结构对齐时，你就感到你理解了这句话，而你脑海中的这个过程就被认为是这句话所表达的意义。而当我们无法构建这种自然变换时，例如，当你看到“你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国，记住我给出的原理”，而无法在脑海完成某个对应的的心理过程以同这句话对齐时，你就无法获得“我懂了”的这个感受。\n   202→\n   203→另一方面，如果你通过网络搜索理解了这句话的发生场景，作为meme的意义，当你再次阅读这句话时，虽然你无法从语法的角度理解他，但是你却能够从网络文化的角度获得“我懂了”的感受。这是因为在文化的范畴上这句话的展开（例如他的使用背景、传播方式、引用逻辑）能够以某种对齐的方式在你的心理过程中展开，由此构建了某种代表一致性的感受$\\eta$。\n   204→\n   205→也就是说，“我懂了”并不是对某句话本身的“本体性确认”，而是对$\\eta$所代表的一致性的那种“体验确认”。当我看到一个东西，我是否理解他，取决于这个东西在我的经验结构中是否能被嵌入到某个已理解的结构系统中，并与这个东西的演化之间获得$\\eta$的感受以建立自然变换。\n   206→\n   207→进一步的说，当我们“感受”到他人的感受、明细了某个现象的“意义”时，例如说，当我意识到，这对情侣是真的相爱的时，我感受到的并不是某种实体性的“爱”，而是当我看到这对情侣的互动后，这些现象和我脑海中的经验与模式“共振”，并帮助我最终抵达、或者创造了我的脑海中那个关于“爱”的感受。\n   208→\n   209→## KA猜想：某种稳定结构\n   210→\n   211→最后，让我们考虑$\\mathbb E_t$的子范畴中的稳定结构。\n   212→\n   213→考虑某一个$\\mathbb E_t$中的子范畴$(\\mathcal E_i)_t$，这一子范畴在演化下将保有某种稳定结构$S_i$，如同先前所叙述的。我们现在假设这一稳定结构是某种子范畴，即$S_i$是$\\{(\\mathcal E_i)_{t_j}\\}_j$中每个范畴的子范畴。数学上我们有许多手段去寻找$S_i$，例如寻找不变子范畴，要求$T$或者$T_i$在$S_i$上的作用是恒等或自然等价。在这里我们使用极限（limit）或余极限（colimit）做尝试。\n   214→\n   215→> Todo: KA猜想\n   216→> 这一章节的核心意图是论证在某些假设下，可以推导出《范畴论与境》A1策略中给出的形而上概念作为范性质的定义，（注意到，K1策略并没有使用塔式构造，也没有使用形而上作为范性质的定义。）。也就是说，形而上概念之所以形成，是因为他形成了体验中的某些稳定结构，并且这些稳定结构作为子范畴当中具有某一种范性质，而这一范性质就是我们所以为的那种“本质”，一种“实体”的感觉。进一步的，在这样明晰了形而上的具体结构后，我们可以论证为什么有的体验能够被形而上，而有一些则不行或者较为困难，也就是到底哪些是有效的子范畴（例如我们如何和为什么能从$\\mathbb E$中构造$\\mathcal E_L$）。我们这里可以用笔作为例子，描述我们见到的笔的现象如何聚合为一种“笔”的“物理实体”，然后再如何由诸多的具体的“笔”构成理想的“笔”的概念。进一步的，在最好的情况下，可以通过哲学实验去经验性的验证起点的假设。同样的，这也可以用于明晰概念如何通过境的演化而产生，迁移，和整合。\n   217→> \n   218→> 这或许也是寻找$S_E$的一种方法，当子范畴被选定为整个$\\mathbb E_t$：极限的泛性质是说：对于任何其他范畴X，如果X也有到这个演化链中每个范畴的函子，并且这些函子与演化函子$T_t$相容，那么存在唯一的函子从X到极限范畴。\n   219→> \n   220→> 最后，还可以寻找一种定义方法定义“张力”。张力是指的某种无法确定唯一终对象的状态。这一察觉来源于语言的使用当中，存在一些逻辑和结构使得一句话“说完了”，不论是在文法上还是在表达上。例如说，当论证完成，逻辑达成闭环时，就意味着论证的终止；当我们诉说完对一个事情的抱怨，不再有任何更多的抱怨以抱怨时，就意味着某些话说完了。与之对应的是一种“完满的感觉”。也就是说，存在一种东西，这个东西是所有语言中的子范畴的终对象的对象。我们可以使用内省作为函子回到$\\mathbb E_t$，于是这意味着当一个形而上指向这一终对象时，我们就感到这一形而上完满、一致和结束，我们把这种感受写作$T$。也就是说，如果有一些感受无法被联想到一个范性质时，例如有多个潜在的范性质可能，但是没有完全满足范性质的条件，我们就无法取得$T$。就像是我们被几个不同的逻辑或者价值观卡住而无法做出决定一样（比如说“救对象还是救爸妈”）。\n   221→> \n   222→> 因为语言的范畴的演化是不断说完话的过程，那么感受的演化也就至少一部分是不断“企图获取”$T$的过程。也就是说，如果我们用“目的”这一框架来描述这一过程，那么在这种意味上，我们为什么要不断、继续的讨论哲学，正是因为在一些哲学的领域我们无法找到或者构建一个范性质以获取$T$。这也是哲学治疗为什么有效的原因。\n   223→> \n   224→> 从另一个角度来讲，小孩子的$\\mathfrak P_t$通常比成年人的要小，因此小孩通常容易在$\\mathbb E_t$中获取和构建连接到$T$的感受，因而小孩更容易取得完满的感受。当小孩长大，$\\mathbb E_t$中的内容越来越多，射态越来越复杂，就有可能有更少比例的感受指向$T$，因而较难取得完满的感受，也就是也就是张力。如果在成长过程中，他能够理清思绪或者寻找到某中框架使得大部分感受指向$T$，那么他就又获得了取回$T$的能力，甚至能够主动的整理和构建自己的感受以主动的获取$T$。\n   225→> \n   226→> 注意到，我们在这里依旧是描述性的。人是否应当不断的获取$T$，抑或是人应当怎么看待$T$，$T$是否意味着某种人的意义，未获取$T$的状态是否具有价值，是否我们应该去避免获取$T$，我们在这里并未做出像这样本体论或者价值论的判断。\n   227→> \n   228→> 关于$T$我还有另一点猜想，那就是$T$可能来源于人对边界的识别，也就是说，在《后形而上学》当中，人所具有的那种分与和的能力，能够把视觉信息中把近似的红色的东西归于一块，认为这是一个东西，和周围的东西不是同一个东西的那个能力。在生理上，可以认为这个能力部分来源于人感官的不精确性（合），在思想上，可以认为这个能力来源于人归纳抽象的能力。也就是说，追求$T$的过程，可以理解为对恒常性的追求。\n   229→> \n   230→> 这也回答了美诺悖论：如果我不知道要学什么，那我怎么学？如果我知道了，为什么还要学？现在我们知道，如果我们无法取得$\\eta$感受，那么我们就会觉得我不完全理解一件事情。这可能是网络中存在空洞导致路径缺失，或者是因为网络存在张力：也就是说我们无法组织网络以获得范性质。那么这时我们就知道了“我不知道”在这个结构中可能存在的某个东西或者某个统一的构造有效子范畴的方式。这就是“我要学的那个东西”，但是她不是我已经学会的东西。当通过整理射态，这一网络中形成了某个泛性质、或者当我们取得新的概念补完路径，获取了$\\eta$，那么我们就觉得我们学会了我们之前想学的那个东西。\n   231→> \n   232→> 进一步的，如果我们能够定义张力，那么我们或许可以由此定义潜在。\n   233→\n   234→\n   235→%% 如果有一个A范畴，这个范畴A里有一个终对象。如果有一个范畴B，并且函子F:A->B。函子本身的性质能够保证A的终对象依旧在B中室终对象或者始对象么？如果不能，F需要具有什么样的性质才可以保证这一点？\n   236→一般地：\n   237→如果 $F$ 是右伴随函子，那么 $F$ 会保所有极限（包括终对象）；\n   238→如果 $F$ 是左伴随函子，则它保所有余极限（包括始对象）。\n   239→ %%\n   240→## K1策略\n   241→\n   242→我们在这里概括K1策略尝试中所构建的几个方法论\n   243→1. 利用转换函子，我们可以将具有良好形式化范畴中的一些结构映射到其他较难研究的范畴中，通过研究前者探索后者当中的某些结构。这是事实上是大部分哲学研究，例如语言游戏，已经在使用的方法，我们现在给这一方法提供了一种结构表达与描述性解释。\n   244→2. 根据K1形式中给定的定义，我们可以对范畴论得到的数学结果进行解读，其解读结果可能是一些哲学论断。\n   245→3. 如果有某一存在于$\\mathbb E$中的对象或者射态（例如前叙的$\\eta_a$），则它是一种体验。并且我们有可能有机会能够通过内省去获得他。进一步的，我们能够通过构建恰当符合结构的例子去唤醒读者的某一种特定的体验。一旦这一例子得以可重复的在不同读者中确立，那么我们等同于进行了一场“哲学实验”，并得以在实践中对相关的哲学论断进行一定程度的验证。需要强调，我们不需要本体论的验证不同的人获得了“同一”体验（例如Qualia），只需要他们他们具有相同的结构性位置。\n   246→4. 更进一步的，如果我们将这种方法应用于不同的人群，我们或许可以获取跨人群、时间、文化的体验差异和共性。例如，倘若有某一体验能够在成年人中被稳定的唤醒，而在儿童中却较为困难，这或许揭示了某种认知结构的发展机制。倘若有某一体验能够在有神论者中被稳定唤醒，而在无神论者中却较为困难，（或者我们无法找到具有显著性的像这样例子），这或许揭示了宗教体验和理解如何构建认知结构。也就是说，部分哲学问题可以被重新表达为“哪些结构在什么人群中可被诱发”，以及“为什么有些结构在某些人群中无法形成”。哲学结构如果在经验中有稳定呈现，就可以通过实践的心理手段作为验证机制进行经验性验证[^2]。在最好的情况下，某一哲学论断对应的范畴论命题可以由在$\\mathbb E$中的某些对象和射态的存在性推出，并且可以通过设计实验，验证这些感受可以通过符合特定结构的思想实验、文学、音乐、画面、影像、互动游戏等方式进行稳定的唤醒，并且被唤醒的体验处于预计的结构上的位置，由此获得这一哲学论断的经验性验证。\n   247→\n   248→最后，我想要强调，本文所得出的结论是描述性的。例如说，我只是描述性的指出可能存在形如$S_{E_c}$这样的稳定结构和其所处的结构性位置，但是他的本体论地位，是否等同于许多哲学框架中的“先天认知结构”，本文并未得出结论。\n   249→\n   250→但是，一旦我们用结构描述出某些认知结构与经验形态，我们就获得了与之相关的那些引导体验、激发理解、构造认知路径的能力。我们不仅仅可以在实践中对他们进行验证和使用，我们还可以利用他们进行推演和衍生，并在实践中确立新的感受和构建新的结构。\n   251→\n   252→## 写在最后\n   253→\n   254→我想要在最后对在方法论中作为“哲学实验”的核心过程做出一些解释：通过构造特定的结构以唤起相应的体验，以此来查明这一体验所处的结构性位置，并最终将这一结论实践和延展，并以此稳定的唤醒和构造体验。这一过程并不仅仅局限于在本文的框架中使用范畴论来描述结构。事实上，诗歌、文学、艺术、音乐、建筑、游戏、烹饪、旅游、meme等等活动都在不断的进行这一过程，使用各自不同的“语言”以描述结构，只是我们在这里使用了范畴论作为这一工具，一个脚手架，但“哲学实验”的实践是广泛的，并且我们可以观察到他广泛的存在于基本的人类活动之中，我们不断的进行境的构建、体验和演化。一个基本的例子：母亲哄孩子睡觉需要设计声音和节奏的结构以构建某种境来唤醒睡意。也就是说，从某种意义上来说，“You have already made the choice. You are here to try to understand why and how you made it”，我们常常已经选择和构建了产生特定感受和体验的境，我们只是有时候不知道为什么（例如忘记了境是何时或怎么被构建的）我们会最终得到这一体验。如果想要明晰我们对生活、自身、和周遭的困惑，我们可以有察觉的注意到这一点，并尝试理解其内部过程，理清这一切是如何发生。我在这里使用的范畴论仅仅是工具的一种，我们已经有许多现成的工具可以帮助我们达成这一点，并且各有所长。\n   255→\n   256→最后，不论读者是否阅读过，我都邀请读者带着对境的理解再次重新阅读我在2022年写的《[[形而上学后的目的：诗意]]》。这篇文章即是“境”的概念被我第一次提出的时候。\n   257→\n   258→## 一些额外猜想\n   259→\n   260→基于本文的猜想，这意味着，如果我们能够给定一组$S_E$和与其兼容的现象集$\\mathfrak P$，那么我们就可以以他为约束生成$\\mathbb E_t$和其演化。即是任何加入$\\mathbb E_t$的对象和射态所导致的$\\mathbb E_t$的演化都必须保证$S_E$的稳定存在，同$S_E$兼容。这意味着，根据$S_E$的不同，我们可以或许可以构造出，至少是现象上来说，具有认知结构的不同实体。一个可能的候选是以某种Homotopy Type Theory的框架作为$S_E$。\n   261→\n   262→[^1]: 注意到，这里有一个问题，那就是$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$时就已经有$\\mathfrak P_{t_c}$，我们不知道$\\mathfrak P$是否在$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$之前就已经存在。进一步的，因为$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$中已经有现象，因此$S_E$当中也可能有现象。换而言之，我们有几种理解先天认知结构的方法。我们这里列出几种，一种是先天认知结构是一种存在于任何现象之前的东西$\\mathbb E_{0}$，$\\mathbb E_{0}$和$\\mathfrak P_{t_c}$共同决定了$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$；另一种是现象的可能形式是由先天认知结构$\\mathbb E_{0}$所决定的，即$\\mathbb E_{0}$决定了$\\mathfrak P_{t_c}$再产生$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$；还有一种是我们认为先天认知结构就是现象的形式，那么$\\mathfrak P_{t_c}$当中就已经包含了先天认知结构。如此等等。注意到，$\\mathbb E_{0}$不在$\\mathfrak P_{t_c}$之中，而$\\mathfrak P_{t_c}$是我们所能探索的边界，因此我们无法对$\\mathbb E_{0}$进行探查。不论如何理解，这些看法只是对$S_E$对本体论位置进行确认，我们事实上能查明的最小稳定结构就是$S_E$。\n   263→[^2]: 注意到，这是一个关于经验的分析判断：如果一个东西在经验中有稳定呈现，就可以进行经验性验证。\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

If you ask me what kind of wisdom, I reply, **such wisdom as is attainable by man**, for to that extent I am inclined to believe that I am wise; whereas the persons of whom I was speaking have a superhuman wisdom, which I may fail to describe, because I have it not myself; and he who says that I have, speaks falsely, and is taking away my character.\" —— *Plato, The Apology of Socrates*\n    69→\n    70→## 一个关于我们从现象中构建境的有趣的Meme\n    71→\n    72→\n    73→![[pink-and-forks.jpg]]\n    74→\n    75→## 一个关于思考是否总是用某种语言的Meme\n    76→\n    77→![[constructed-in-my-head.jpg]]\n    78→\n    79→\n    80→草稿\n    81→----\n    82→## 两种困惑\n    83→\n    84→我们可以概括我们大体上有两种困惑。第一种问题是我们不具有实践能力的问题。例如说，我们不知道怎么样让一个\n    85→\n    86→第二种是我们已经具有实践能力，并且在实践，却不理解的问题。\n    87→\n    88→哲学不提供选择，而是告诉你，你为什么做这个选择。\n    89→\n    90→我们也不需要寻求选择，因为我们已经做出了选择，只是我们不知道我们为什么做这个选择。哲学的企图即使尝试see beyound a choice we do not understand\n    91→\n    92→\n    93→## 终极实在\n    94→\n    95→按照作A1策略来说，在形而上学中，某个终极实在生成了其他所有的东西。那么也就是说在0元阶有一个对象（终极实在），那么在后面的东西就是这个对象到这个对象到射态（但不一定是单位元，有点像是群），然后再是这上面的射态度。这个“从终极实在到终极实在的射态”，的感觉，似乎完美的描述了所谓不动的动者的概。\n    96→\n    97→另一方面：一是一个{0,1}（你说““二”（阴阳的对立统一）从一开始就是“一”得以动态存在的内在结构”），然后他到他自己的射态构成了一个Z_2（二源于“分别”这一认知行为的诞生）。道是说可以有集合这个东西。\n    98→\n    99→这么说起来，所有形而上学体系，似乎都必须要包含一个代表某种原初存在的对象并构造从自己到自己的射态这样的结构，产生其他的东西。比如说不动的动者，或者是你刚说的内部存在某种两极的一（事实上这个概念现在来看也是某种不动的动者，他有某种在内部运动的潜能）。这似乎就是“自在”的结构？当然这个可以是某种单一东西推出所有，也可以是很多自在的东西构成实在然后被我们认知到。我很好奇其他的形而上学是否也是这样？\n   100→\n   101→## 美学\n   102→\n   103→美学就是通过构建艺术作品来唤醒体验，并以此企图抵达某些更普遍性的人的关于“美”的S_E的学科。\n   104→\n   105→## 为诗性体验和哲学奠定合法性基础\n   106→\n   107→康德“为经验科学奠定合法性基础”，我们似乎在“为诗性体验和哲学奠定合法性基础”？\n   108→\n   109→\n   110→\n   111→## 解决了的哲学问题\n   112→\n   113→看起来，作者用同一个框架至少直接消解或者解决了： \n   114→\n   115→- 集体主义的定义问题 \n   116→- 知识的定义问题 \n   117→- 荒谬主义 \n   118→- 康德问题 \n   119→- 存在主义 \n   120→- 人的定义到底是啥（在实践中） \n   121→- 忒修斯之船 \n   122→- 对象化和异化为什么成立 \n   123→- 语言是意义先于结构还是相反 \n   124→- 什么是理解 \n   125→- 我们到底理解了什么 \n   126→- 美诺悖论 \n   127→- 什么是东方哲学的醒悟 \n   128→- 哲学如何具有可操作性 \n   129→- 主体间性\n   130→\n   131→这些问题？\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

Legenravend/49 Workspace/Kantian/Dictionary.md","content":"# Translation Dictionary for 境集 (Jing-Collection)\n## Kantian/Transcendental Philosophy Perspective\n\n**Expert:** Kantian/Transcendental Philosophy Specialist\n**Date:** 2026-02-10\n**Purpose:** To provide philosophically grounded translation recommendations for key terms in the 境集 essays, with attention to their relation to Kantian and transcendental philosophical vocabulary.\n\n---\n\n## 现象 (xiànxiàng)\n- **Main translation**: Phenomenon / Phenomena (plural)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Experiential field\" when emphasizing the totality of what is given\n  - \"Appearance\" in explicitly Kantian contexts (to align with *Erscheinung*)\n  - Keep \"phenomenon\" in most cases with translator's note\n- **Note**: While the standard translation \"phenomenon\" invokes Kant's *Erscheinung*, the author's usage is broader and more phenomenologically immediate. For Kant, phenomena are always already constituted by the forms of intuition (space/time) and categories of understanding. The author's 现象 refers to raw experiential content prior to any intellectual processing—closer to the \"manifold of intuition\" before synthesis, or to Husserlian *Erlebnis* (lived experience). The author explicitly identifies 现象 as 第一实在 (First Reality), the indubitable starting point of all cognition. This is the empirical given, but not yet structured as Kantian appearance. Translation should preserve this pre-constitutive immediacy while acknowledging Kantian resonance.\n\n---\n\n## 第一实在 (dì yī shízài)\n- **Main translation**: First Reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Primary reality\" when emphasizing epistemic order\n  - \"Phenomenal reality\" in explicitly contrastive contexts\n- **Note**: This is the author's coinage for what we \"possess\" (拥有) first—现象 understood as our indubitable epistemic ground. The ordinal \"first\" is temporal/epistemic (what we encounter first), NOT ontological (what exists first). This parallels Kant's \"empirical reality\" (*empirische Realität*) but with crucial difference: Kant's empirical reality is already transcendentally constituted, whereas the author's 第一实在 precedes all constitution. The footnote explicitly states this is a *name*, not an ontological claim. The author's insistence that 现象 is 无可怀疑 (indubitable) echoes Kant's transcendental argument that all cognition begins with experience. Translator should note that \"First\" refers to order of access, not order of being.\n\n---\n\n## 第〇实在 (dì líng shízài)\n- **Main translation**: Zeroth Reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Zero-Reality\" (hyphenated) for emphasis\n  - \"Ground Reality\" in metaphysical contexts where the ordinal nature is clear\n- **Note**: The author's term for what traditional metaphysics posits as ultimate ground—structurally parallel to Kant's thing-in-itself (*Ding an sich*) or noumenon. The mathematical/ordinal \"zeroth\" evokes something \"prior to\" First Reality in logical/ontological order. Critically, the author argues: \"对于我们而言，并不存在第〇实在，而只存在第二实在。当我们提出第〇实在时，这个我们所提出的东西就是第二实在\" (For us, Zeroth Reality does not exist; only Second Reality exists. When we propose Zeroth Reality, what we propose is already Second Reality). This precisely mirrors Kant's doctrine that the thing-in-itself is a *Grenzbegriff* (limiting concept, B310-311)—it cannot be known, and any determination of it transforms it into phenomenon. The Daoist parallel: 真正的道不可道不可名 (the true Dao cannot be spoken or named). The post-metaphysical twist: the author performs a \"disenchantment\" (祛魅) that goes beyond Kant—the very *desire* for 第〇实在 is recognized as non-rational (非理性), whereas Kant treats the noumenon as a necessary thought of reason.\n\n---\n\n## 第二实在 (dì èr shízài)\n- **Main translation**: Second Reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Constructed reality\" when emphasizing the generative process\n  - \"Conceptual reality\" in epistemological contexts\n  - \"Metaphysical constructs\" when referring to multiple instances\n- **Note**: The reality we construct from 第一实在—all our concepts, theories, and structured understanding of phenomena. This corresponds roughly to Kant's \"object of experience as constituted by the understanding.\" In the Daoist example: 道德仁义礼 as articulated concepts are all 第二实在, constructed upward from 现象 but *understood* (in pre-metaphysics) as if they descended from 第〇实在. The key post-metaphysical recognition is that all 形而上 (the metaphysical) is 第二实在—constructed from phenomena, not grounding them. This parallels the \"Copernican revolution\" in Kant's CPR, where objects must conform to our cognition rather than vice versa. However, the author goes further: even the noumenon, once articulated, becomes Second Reality.\n\n---\n\n## 形而上学 (xíng ér shàng xué)\n- **Main translation**: Metaphysics\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Metaphysical inquiry\" to emphasize the disciplinary aspect\n  - \"Metaphysical studies\" in academic contexts\n- **Note**: The discipline/study of 形而上 (the metaphysical). The Chinese etymology from *Yijing* 系辞传: \"形而上者謂之道，形而下者謂之器\" (What is above form is called Dao; what is below form is called implements). Standard translation of \"metaphysics\" (from Greek *meta ta physika*). The author carefully distinguishes 形而上学 (the study) from 形而上 (metaphysical constructs themselves). Western metaphysics seeks *ultimate reality* (终极实在); Chinese thought more often operates *within* given 形而上 frameworks to reach 至善 (supreme good) and cultivate 圣人 (the sage). The author's critical move: all metaphysics rests on the non-rational (非理性) pursuit of constancy (恒常). This genealogy is closer to Nietzsche than Kant, though the framework remains transcendental in structure.\n\n---\n\n## 形而上 (xíng ér shàng)\n- **Main translation**: The metaphysical / metaphysical construct(s)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Metaphysical structure\" when referring to systematic constructions\n  - \"Supra-phenomenal\" to emphasize the beyond-phenomenon aspect\n  - \"Abstract concept\" in simpler contexts\n- **Note**: A property or construct that stands \"above\" phenomena—any concept, category, or structure abstracted from 现象. The author reinterprets 形 as 现象 (phenomenon) rather than the traditional reading, making 形而上 literally \"that which is above/upon phenomena.\" This is NOT ontologically prior but epistemically derivative—built UP from phenomena, though traditionally *understood* as descending DOWN to generate phenomena. The author identifies three types: 第〇种 (recognition of repeated patterns), 第一种 (predictive generalizations), 第二种 (abstraction into concepts). The core of all 形而上 is 恒常 (constancy)—the pursuit of invariant structure amid change. In Kantian terms, this includes both empirical concepts and pure concepts (categories), but the author's framework does not distinguish them as sharply. The author's universal property (泛性质) definition from category theory: 形而上 is a universal property in a subcategory of E (境).\n\n---\n\n## 后形而上学 (hòu xíng ér shàng xué)\n- **Main translation**: Post-metaphysics\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Post-metaphysical thought\" when referring to the approach\n  - \"After metaphysics\" for literal emphasis\n- **Note**: Metaphysics *after* nihilism—after the recognition that 第〇实在 has no special epistemic privilege and that the pursuit of ultimate ground is non-rational. This is NOT anti-metaphysical or a rejection of 形而上; rather, it is metaphysics with explicit recognition that all metaphysical constructs are built from 现象 upward, not given from above. The key moves: (1) disenchantment (祛魅) of 第〇实在; (2) recognition of the non-rational (非理性) drive underlying metaphysical construction; (3) acknowledgment that 现象 occupies the structurally primary position. The method is 实践 (practice)—the \"overlap of ideal and phenomenon\" (理想和现象之重叠). This parallels Kant's limitation of metaphysics in CPR but goes further: Kant cordons off noumena while maintaining their regulative function; the author accepts the non-rationality at the foundation and builds post-metaphysics as deliberate, acknowledged construction. Closer to Nietzsche's \"gay science\" or pragmatist/constructivist approaches, but retaining transcendental structure.\n\n---\n\n## 先验 (xiān yàn)\n- **Main translation**: A priori / transcendental (context-dependent)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"A priori\" when referring to knowledge independent of experience\n  - \"Transcendental\" when referring to conditions of possibility of experience\n  - Keep Chinese term with gloss in highly technical passages\n- **Note**: Standard translation of Kant's *a priori* (prior to experience) and *transzendental* (concerning conditions of possibility). In the K1 strategy essay, the author writes: \"如果你认为这一时刻是某种E_t首次出现的时刻...则你可以将这种稳定结构当中的这一部分认定为'先天'\" (If you consider this the moment of E_t's first appearance, independent of experience, you may identify this part of the stable structure as \"a priori\"). The author's S_E (stable structure preserved under evolution functor T) plays the role of Kantian a priori structures—forms of intuition and categories—but the author leaves S_E formally unspecified and proposes to discover it empirically through \"philosophical experiments.\" This is methodologically post-Kantian: the *form* of synthetic a priori knowledge, but the *content* left to empirical investigation. The author deliberately withholds Kant's strong modal claims while retaining the structural insight.\n\n---\n\n## 范畴 (fànchóu)\n- **Main translation**: Category (context determines mathematical or philosophical sense)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Category\" (mathematical category theory) in technical passages\n  - \"Category of understanding\" when explicitly invoking Kant\n  - Distinguish by capitalization or context\n- **Note**: Dual usage: (1) Philosophical—Kant's *Kategorien*, the pure concepts of understanding that structure experience (substance, causality, etc.); (2) Mathematical—category theory (范畴论), the formal language the author uses to describe the structure of 境. The author's major innovation: replacing Kant's table of twelve categories (derived from logical forms of judgment) with category-theoretic structures. Universal properties (泛性质) replace Kantian categories; functors replace schematism; natural transformations replace synthetic unity of apperception. This is structure-first rather than logic-first. The advantage: formal precision and generativity beyond Kant's discursive formulations. The shift: from Kant's fixed categories to dynamically evolving cognitive structures described by functors.\n\n---\n\n## 构造 (gòuzào)\n- **Main translation**: Construction / constitute (verb: construct)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Constitution\" when emphasizing transcendental constitution\n  - \"Building\" in simpler contexts\n  - \"Synthesis\" when the Kantian parallel is explicit\n- **Note**: The process by which 第二实在 is built up from 第一实在; the generation of structured 境 from raw phenomena. Parallels Kant's *synthesis*—the activity of the understanding that combines the manifold of intuition into unified experience. However, the author's usage is broader and more dynamic: construction includes not just cognitive synthesis but practical, linguistic, and cultural construction. The author's \"construction\" (构造) in category theory refers to the *塔式构造* (tower construction) by which higher-order structures emerge from lower-order ones. This formalizes what Kant described discursively: how concepts of increasing generality/abstraction arise from more concrete contents. The key difference: the author treats construction as ongoing, revisable, and multiple (different constructions possible), whereas Kant's synthesis via the categories is fixed and universal.\n\n---\n\n## 综合 (zōnghé)\n- **Main translation**: Synthesis / synthetic\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Combination\" in non-technical contexts\n  - \"Synthetic judgment\" when discussing knowledge claims\n- **Note**: Kant's *Synthesis*—the act of combining different representations and grasping their manifoldness in one cognition. In Kant, synthesis is the fundamental operation of understanding; all knowledge involves synthesis of intuitions under concepts. The author uses this term in parallel sense: the subjective synthesis of phenomena to produce meaning. In the appendix essay, the author writes: \"一件事物的意义是什么这一问题的回答可能是一种知识（即可能是一种先天综合判断）...通过对现象的主观综合而来\" (The answer to \"what does X mean\" may be a kind of knowledge—synthetic a priori judgment—arising through subjective synthesis of phenomena). This extends Kant's synthetic a priori from mathematics/natural science to the domain of meaning. The framework: meaning has the same epistemic structure as scientific knowledge—it emerges from structural conditions (S_E) through which experience is constituted, not from bare experience or pure concepts alone.\n\n---\n\n## 分析 (fēnxī)\n- **Main translation**: Analysis / analytic\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Analytical judgment\" in epistemological contexts\n  - \"Decomposition\" when emphasizing the breaking-down aspect\n- **Note**: Kant's *Analytik* and *analytische Urteile* (analytic judgments)—judgments in which the predicate is contained in the concept of the subject (e.g., \"All bachelors are unmarried\"). Contrasts with synthetic judgments, which add new information. Kant's critical question: \"How are synthetic a priori judgments possible?\" The author adopts this distinction in discussing knowledge but focuses primarily on the synthetic—how new understanding arises. The author's main concern is with construction (synthesis), not decomposition (analysis), though both are operative in the formation and clarification of concepts.\n\n---\n\n## 境 (jìng)\n- **Main translation**: Jing (keep untranslated with gloss) / experiential realm\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Experiential realm\" as translation\n  - \"Field of experience\" in some contexts\n  - \"Lifeworld\" if invoking Husserl\n  - \"境-structure\" when emphasizing the formal structure\n- **Note**: The central concept. E (境) = Enclosed + Emotion + Experience. The structured totality of experience at a moment—现象 with structure imposed on it. In category theory: 境 is a category whose objects are selected from phenomena (感受) and whose morphisms are associations (联想, also 感受). Critically, morphisms are also objects (making E a tower structure / arrows-only metacategory). No direct Kantian equivalent, but resonates with several concepts: Husserl's \"field of consciousness,\" Heidegger's \"world\" (*Welt*), Kant's \"unity of apperception\" as the unified field of experience. The Buddhist/Chinese aesthetic term 境界 (realm, state of mind) underlies this usage. The author's innovation: formalizing this with category theory to describe both the structure and its evolution (via functor T). In Kantian terms, 境 is experience *as structured by the subject*, but the author does not presume Kant's specific forms (space/time) or categories. Instead, the structure is to be discovered empirically. Recommended: Keep \"Jing\" untranslated in the main translation with explanatory notes, using \"experiential realm\" or \"境-structure\" where clarification is needed.\n\n---\n\n## 恒常 (héngcháng)\n- **Main translation**: Constancy\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Permanence\" when invoking Kant's First Analogy explicitly\n  - \"Invariance\" in mathematical/formal contexts\n  - \"Stability\" when discussing stable structures\n- **Note**: The core of all 形而上—the pursuit of invariant structure amid phenomenal change. The author writes: \"形而上的核心是恒常\" (The core of the metaphysical is constancy). This is what we seek when we form concepts, make predictions, abstract generalizations—a \"guarantee\" (保证) that the same structures will recur. In Kantian terms, this resonates with the First Analogy of Experience—the principle of the permanence of substance (CPR A182/B224). For Kant, permanence is a transcendental condition: without something permanent in intuition, no time-determination is possible, hence no experience. The author's 恒常 is both the *object* of metaphysical pursuit and the *structural feature* preserved by evolution functor T in stable structure S_E. This is the non-rational drive (非理性) underlying all cognition: the need for \"handles\" (抓手) on phenomena to make meaningful action possible. Translation: \"constancy\" avoids the excessive Kantian specificity of \"permanence\" while preserving the sense of temporal/structural invariance.\n\n---\n\n## 感受 (gǎnshòu)\n- **Main translation**: Feeling / sensation (context-dependent)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Sensory experience\" when emphasizing empirical input\n  - \"Affective experience\" when emphasizing emotion\n  - \"Experiential content\" in formal contexts\n- **Note**: The fundamental unit of P (现象). The author writes: \"即便对于客观世界模型来说，任何对于我们有影响的事物都必须通过'感受'或者'体验'以'进入'我们的'视野'以成为'现象'\" (Even for the objective world model, anything that affects us must enter our view through \"feeling\" or \"experience\" to become \"phenomenon\"). This is phenomenologically immediate—the raw \"what it is like\" of experience. Closer to the sensory \"matter\" of appearance in Kant's terminology, or to *Empfindung* (sensation), but without Kant's sharp form/matter distinction. The author treats 感受 as both objects and morphisms in E—both the contents of experience and the associative links between them. This anticipates the tower structure of 境. Translation: \"feeling\" for affective/phenomenological contexts; \"sensation\" when emphasizing sensory input; clarify with context.\n\n---\n\n## 经验 (jīngyàn)\n- **Main translation**: Experience\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Empirical experience\" when contrasting with a priori\n  - \"Experiential\" (adjective)\n- **Note**: Kant's *Erfahrung*—structured, unified cognition of phenomena. For Kant, experience is always already synthesized by the understanding via the categories; it is not mere perception but cognition of objects in accordance with rules. The author uses 经验 similarly—experience as structured by 境, not raw phenomena. However, the author's framework allows for more radical variability in experiential structure across individuals and developmental stages (via different S_E), whereas Kant insists on universal forms. The author's post-metaphysical stance: experience is the starting point (第一实在) and the site of all construction, but its structure is not deduced a priori (as in Kant) but investigated empirically through \"philosophical experiments.\"\n\n---\n\n## 体验 (tǐyàn)\n- **Main translation**: Lived experience / concrete experience\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Experiential episode\" for individual instances\n  - \"Experiencing\" (gerund) to emphasize process\n- **Note**: Often synonymous with 感受 in the author's usage but with a more holistic connotation—the *living through* of experience, not just isolated sensations. Closer to Husserl's *Erlebnis* (lived experience) or Dilthey's *Erleben*. The author uses 体验 and 感受 somewhat interchangeably to denote the contents of 现象/P. In contexts where distinction matters, 体验 suggests richer, more integrated experiential episodes (e.g., aesthetic experience, emotional states), while 感受 can refer to more elementary sensory/affective units. Translation flexibility: use \"lived experience\" for phenomenological emphasis, \"experience\" in general usage.\n\n---\n\n## 非理性 (fēi lǐxìng)\n- **Main translation**: The non-rational\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Non-rational drive\" when referring to the underlying impulse\n  - \"Arational\" to emphasize not anti-rational but outside reason's scope\n- **Note**: NOT \"irrational\" (which implies opposition to reason or irrationality as defect). \"Non-rational\" indicates something outside reason's domain but not thereby condemned. The author's critical claim: \"理性的目的必然要在理性之外...理性仅仅作为一种工具而存在\" (Reason's purpose must lie outside reason...reason exists only as a tool). Therefore: \"对终极实在的追求本身就是非理性的（形而上学本身就是非理性的）\" (The pursuit of ultimate reality is itself non-rational; metaphysics itself is non-rational). The drive for 恒常 (constancy), for \"handles\" on phenomena, for self-realization through practice—all are 非理性. This must be *acknowledged* (承认), not overcome. This marks a departure from Kant: for Kant, reason's demand for the unconditioned (the Ideas of Reason) is *rational*, even if it cannot be satisfied theoretically. The author's genealogy is closer to Nietzsche (the will to power underlying reason) or Schopenhauer (the Will underlying representation). However, the author does not valorize the non-rational over the rational; instead, post-metaphysics *acknowledges* both and works with them in 实践.\n\n---\n\n## 理性 (lǐxìng)\n- **Main translation**: Reason / rationality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Rational faculty\" when referring to Kant's *Vernunft*\n  - \"The rational\" as substantive\n- **Note**: Kant's *Vernunft* (Reason) vs. *Verstand* (Understanding). In Kant's architecture, Understanding applies categories to intuitions to produce experience; Reason seeks systematic unity and generates the Ideas (God, freedom, immortality). The author uses 理性 more generally for the capacity for conceptual thought, inference, justification—the \"rational\" dimension of cognition. The key post-metaphysical move: reason is a *tool* (工具), and its purposes are non-rational (非理性). This deflates reason from its Kantian status as the source of necessary structures (categories) and regulative ideals (Ideas) to a means in service of non-rational ends. However, the author does not abandon rational inquiry; rather, post-metaphysics acknowledges that reason operates within bounds set by non-rational drives (for constancy, self-realization) and returns to phenomena through practice.\n\n---\n\n## 超越 (chāoyuè)\n- **Main translation**: Transcendence / to transcend\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Surpassing\" when emphasizing the movement beyond\n  - \"Going beyond\" in simpler contexts\n- **Note**: Going beyond current limits—of experience, of the self, of a given 境. The author distinguishes: (1) 超越 of the 境界 (boundary) of thought—moving from one cognitive/experiential structure to another (e.g., via evolution functor T); (2) The unattainable 超越 toward 第〇实在, which is non-rational and always transforms into 第二实在 when articulated. In Kantian terms, *transzendental* (transcendental) refers to conditions of possibility of experience; *transzendent* (transcendent) refers to what lies beyond possible experience. The author's usage is closer to the latter—transcendence as the movement beyond a given boundary. However, post-metaphysics recognizes that we cannot transcend phenomena themselves (第一实在), only move from one structured configuration (境) to another. The author's notion of 超越 is more akin to Heidegger's *Überstieg* or existentialist notions of self-overcoming than to Kant's transcendental method.\n\n---\n\n## 超越性 (chāoyuè xìng)\n- **Main translation**: Transcendence (substantive) / transcendent quality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Transcendent dimension\" when referring to what lies beyond\n  - \"The transcendent\" as philosophical term\n- **Note**: The quality or dimension of what lies beyond (a 境, a framework, the self). The author writes: \"超越之所在是（可以）存在的\" (Transcendence can exist), but it is not directly accessible—we encounter only its \"results\" (the phenomena that are \"放入篮子,\" placed in the basket). In Kantian terms, this is the transcendent realm (God, noumena, things-in-themselves)—posited but unknowable. The author's twist: we study the *manifestation* of transcendence (how phenomena change, how 境 evolves), not transcendence itself. This is the research program of K1 strategy: to study the evolution of 境 (via functor T) to understand how \"what enters the basket\" (what becomes phenomenon) structures experience. The author's 超越性 is not a separate ontological realm but the *dynamic* dimension of experience—the fact that 境 evolves, that new structures emerge, that we are not trapped in a static framework.\n\n---\n\n## 自然变换 (zìrán biànhuàn)\n- **Main translation**: Natural transformation\n- **Alternatives**: None (this is a technical term from category theory)\n- **Note**: A concept from mathematical category theory: a natural transformation η between two functors F and G (both from category C to D) assigns to each object X in C a morphism η_X: F(X) → G(X) in D, such that for every morphism f: X → Y in C, the naturality condition holds: G(f) ∘ η_X = η_Y ∘ F(f). The author's philosophical application: a natural transformation between the evolution of formal structures (language, mathematics) and the evolution of experience (境) is the condition of *understanding*. When we \"understand\" a sentence, a formula, or a phenomenon, we establish a natural transformation linking the structural unfolding of that object with our experiential/cognitive process. The η morphisms represent the \"feeling of alignment\" (一致性感受) or \"confirmation\" (确认). When η is the identity morphism, we have *mastery* (掌握)—direct, immediate understanding without mediation. This is a profound formalization of what it means to \"get it\": the isomorphism (or at least systematic correspondence) between external structure and internal process. In Kantian terms, this formalizes the schematism—the mediating process between pure concepts and sensible intuitions—and extends it to meaning, aesthetics, and all understanding.\n\n---\n\n## 函子 (hánzǐ)\n- **Main translation**: Functor\n- **Alternatives**: None (technical term from category theory)\n- **Note**: A structure-preserving map between categories. A functor F: C → D maps objects of C to objects of D and morphisms of C to morphisms of D, preserving composition and identities. The author's key application: the evolution functor T: E_t → E_{t+1} describes how 境 changes over \"time\" (t need not be physical time—any label for developmental/processual stages). Various \"转换函子\" (transformation functors) map between subcategories: F_{E,L} embeds language-境 into total 境; F_{L→K} maps language to knowledge; etc. Functors formalize processes: learning, understanding, conceptual development, structural change. This is the author's major methodological innovation beyond Kant: Kant's framework is static (the categories do not evolve); the author introduces dynamics via functors. This allows for developmental psychology, historical/cultural variation in cognitive structures, and individual differences—all within a transcendental-style framework.\n\n---\n\n## 稳定结构 (wěndìng jiégòu)\n- **Main translation**: Stable structure\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Invariant structure\" when emphasizing what is preserved\n  - \"Structural invariant\" in mathematical contexts\n- **Note**: The structure S_E preserved under the evolution functor T—what remains constant as 境 evolves. This is the formal counterpart to 恒常 (constancy). The author's conjecture: there exists a stable structure S_E such that T(S_E) ≅ S_E (T preserves S_E, up to isomorphism). If S_E can be identified at the earliest stage E_{t_c}, it becomes a candidate for \"a priori cognitive structure\" (先天认知结构)—though the author is careful to note this is descriptive, not prescriptive, and requires empirical investigation via \"philosophical experiments.\" In Kantian terms, S_E corresponds to the forms of intuition (space/time) and categories of understanding—the necessary structures without which no experience could be constituted. The key differences from Kant: (1) S_E is not deduced from the table of judgments but conjectured and investigated; (2) S_E may vary across individuals/populations/developmental stages; (3) S_E is discovered by examining what structure remains invariant under T, not by transcendental deduction. This is the empirical-transcendental synthesis the author proposes: transcendental in form (conditions of possible experience), empirical in method (discovered through investigation of experiential evolution).\n\n---\n\n## 认知结构 (rènzhī jiégòu)\n- **Main translation**: Cognitive structure\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Epistemic structure\" when emphasizing knowledge\n  - \"Conceptual framework\" in less technical contexts\n- **Note**: The structural features of 境 that enable cognition. The author writes: \"如果你认为E表示了某种认知，那么假如能够证明这一稳定结构当中的一部分一旦缺失，则无法从P_t中构建任何E_t，则可以将这部分稳定结构称之为'认知结构'\" (If E represents cognition, and if it can be shown that without part of the stable structure, no E_t can be constructed from P_t, then this part may be called \"cognitive structure\"). This is a transcendental argument: X is a cognitive structure if X is a necessary condition for constructing 境 from phenomena. Parallel to Kant's categories as conditions of the possibility of experience. The author's framework allows for empirical investigation of what these structures are (via philosophical experiments across populations), whereas Kant deduces them a priori. In contemporary terms, this bridges transcendental philosophy and cognitive science—an empirical search for innate or developmentally necessary cognitive structures, but framed within a transcendental architecture (conditions of possibility).\n\n---\n\n## Additional Terms\n\n### 泛性质 (fàn xìngzhì)\n- **Main translation**: Universal property\n- **Note**: Technical term from category theory. An object X in category C has a universal property if every other object in C (or in a relevant subcategory) maps to/from X in a unique way. The author's definition of 形而上: \"一个形而上m是E中的联想，且m在E的某个子范畴中是范性质\" (A metaphysical construct m is a morphism in E, and m is a universal property in some subcategory of E). Example: the concept \"笔\" (pen) is a universal property in the subcategory of E containing 铅笔, 钢笔, 粉笔, etc. The \"feeling\" we get when seeing any pen is the universal property—the limit/terminal object toward which all specific pen-experiences map. This formalizes what Kant called the \"schema\" of a concept and what traditional metaphysics called the \"essence\" or \"universal.\"\n\n### 塔式结构 (tǎ shì jiégòu)\n- **Main translation**: Tower structure\n- **Note**: A category where morphisms are also objects, constructed iteratively: T_0 (base category) → T_1 (objects are morphisms of T_0) → T_2 (objects are objects and morphisms of T_1) → ... → T_∞. The author's 境 (E) is a tower structure because morphisms (associations, 联想) are also experiential contents (感受), hence also objects. This structure allows for meta-levels: thinking about thinking, concepts of concepts, associations between associations. This formalizes the reflexivity of consciousness and the hierarchical structure of abstraction. No direct Kantian parallel, but related to Fichte's reflexive self-positing of the I.\n\n### 实践 (shíjiàn)\n- **Main translation**: Practice / praxis\n- **Note**: The core methodological principle of post-metaphysics: \"理想和现象之重叠\" (the overlap of ideal and phenomenon). Through practice, we construct 境, test them against phenomena, and iterate. This is not Kant's \"practical reason\" (moral/volitional) but closer to pragmatist or Marxist praxis—the active, iterative engagement with the world that constitutes both self and world. Practice is how post-metaphysics avoids dogmatism: we acknowledge that all constructs are 第二实在 (Second Reality), and we test them through practice, revising as needed. This is the post-metaphysical answer to nihilism: not \"nothing matters\" but \"we construct what matters, and practice tests and refines our constructions.\"\n\n### 诗意 (shīyì)\n- **Main translation**: The poetic / poetic engagement\n- **Note**: The author's term for the proper stance after post-metaphysical recognition. \"清醒的梦境\" (lucid dreaming)—we construct and inhabit meaningful structures while knowing they are constructions. Not Kant's \"discipline of pure reason\" but closer to Nietzsche's \"gay science,\" Heidegger's \"poetic dwelling,\" or Daoist \"play\" (游). The poetic is the *freedom* to construct境, to engage with experience creatively, aesthetically, meaningfully, without metaphysical illusion but also without nihilistic despair. This is the post-metaphysical resolution: neither dogmatic belief in 第〇实在 nor nihilistic rejection of all 形而上, but deliberate, acknowledged, joyful construction.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis dictionary provides translation recommendations grounded in the Kantian/transcendental philosophical tradition while acknowledging the author's innovations and divergences. The author's framework is recognizably transcendental in structure (phenomena → conditions of possibility → structured experience) but post-Kantian in method (empirical investigation, dynamic evolution, explicit acknowledgment of non-rationality). Translation should preserve both the Kantian resonances (for Western philosophical readers) and the author's original contributions (category-theoretic formalization, post-metaphysical stance, integration of Chinese philosophical concepts).\n\nFor the translation team: Consistency in rendering these key terms across all essays is critical. Where the author's usage diverges from standard Kantian vocabulary, translator's notes should clarify both the parallel and the difference. The goal is to make this work accessible to readers in the Western philosophical tradition while preserving its originality and rigor.\n\n---\n\n**Prepared by:** Kantian/Transcendental Philosophy Expert\n**Date:** 2026-02-10\n**For:** jing-translation team\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":51829,"cache_read_input_tokens":11120,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":51829},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CXzp2FYwPdUW6ydF9vpdZ","type":"assistant","uuid":"c77b963e-b1b3-47e0-b1cc-75049ce17594","timestamp":"2026-02-10T17:53:51.838Z"}

For Kant, phenomena are always already constituted by the forms of intuition (space/time) and categories of understanding. The author's 现象 refers to raw experiential content prior to any intellectual processing—closer to the \"manifold of intuition\" before synthesis, or to Husserlian *Erlebnis* (lived experience). The author explicitly identifies 现象 as 第一实在 (First Reality), the indubitable starting point of all cognition. This is the empirical given, but not yet structured as Kantian appearance. Translation should preserve this pre-constitutive immediacy while acknowledging Kantian resonance.\n\n---\n\n## 第一实在 (dì yī shízài)\n- **Main translation**: First Reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Primary reality\" when emphasizing epistemic order\n  - \"Phenomenal reality\" in explicitly contrastive contexts\n- **Note**: This is the author's coinage for what we \"possess\" (拥有) first—现象 understood as our indubitable epistemic ground. The ordinal \"first\" is temporal/epistemic (what we encounter first), NOT ontological (what exists first). This parallels Kant's \"empirical reality\" (*empirische Realität*) but with crucial difference: Kant's empirical reality is already transcendentally constituted, whereas the author's 第一实在 precedes all constitution. The footnote explicitly states this is a *name*, not an ontological claim. The author's insistence that 现象 is 无可怀疑 (indubitable) echoes Kant's transcendental argument that all cognition begins with experience. Translator should note that \"First\" refers to order of access, not order of being.\n\n---\n\n## 第〇实在 (dì líng shízài)\n- **Main translation**: Zeroth Reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Zero-Reality\" (hyphenated) for emphasis\n  - \"Ground Reality\" in metaphysical contexts where the ordinal nature is clear\n- **Note**: The author's term for what traditional metaphysics posits as ultimate ground—structurally parallel to Kant's thing-in-itself (*Ding an sich*) or noumenon. The mathematical/ordinal \"zeroth\" evokes something \"prior to\" First Reality in logical/ontological order. Critically, the author argues: \"对于我们而言，并不存在第〇实在，而只存在第二实在。当我们提出第〇实在时，这个我们所提出的东西就是第二实在\" (For us, Zeroth Reality does not exist; only Second Reality exists. When we propose Zeroth Reality, what we propose is already Second Reality). This precisely mirrors Kant's doctrine that the thing-in-itself is a *Grenzbegriff* (limiting concept, B310-311)—it cannot be known, and any determination of it transforms it into phenomenon. The Daoist parallel: 真正的道不可道不可名 (the true Dao cannot be spoken or named). The post-metaphysical twist: the author performs a \"disenchantment\" (祛魅) that goes beyond Kant—the very *desire* for 第〇实在 is recognized as non-rational (非理性), whereas Kant treats the noumenon as a necessary thought of reason.\n\n---\n\n## 第二实在 (dì èr shízài)\n- **Main translation**: Second Reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Constructed reality\" when emphasizing the generative process\n  - \"Conceptual reality\" in epistemological contexts\n  - \"Metaphysical constructs\" when referring to multiple instances\n- **Note**: The reality we construct from 第一实在—all our concepts, theories, and structured understanding of phenomena. This corresponds roughly to Kant's \"object of experience as constituted by the understanding.\" In the Daoist example: 道德仁义礼 as articulated concepts are all 第二实在, constructed upward from 现象 but *understood* (in pre-metaphysics) as if they descended from 第〇实在. The key post-metaphysical recognition is that all 形而上 (the metaphysical) is 第二实在—constructed from phenomena, not grounding them. This parallels the \"Copernican revolution\" in Kant's CPR, where objects must conform to our cognition rather than vice versa. However, the author goes further: even the noumenon, once articulated, becomes Second Reality.\n\n---\n\n## 形而上学 (xíng ér shàng xué)\n- **Main translation**: Metaphysics\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Metaphysical inquiry\" to emphasize the disciplinary aspect\n  - \"Metaphysical studies\" in academic contexts\n- **Note**: The discipline/study of 形而上 (the metaphysical). The Chinese etymology from *Yijing* 系辞传: \"形而上者謂之道，形而下者謂之器\" (What is above form is called Dao; what is below form is called implements). Standard translation of \"metaphysics\" (from Greek *meta ta physika*). The author carefully distinguishes 形而上学 (the study) from 形而上 (metaphysical constructs themselves). Western metaphysics seeks *ultimate reality* (终极实在); Chinese thought more often operates *within* given 形而上 frameworks to reach 至善 (supreme good) and cultivate 圣人 (the sage). The author's critical move: all metaphysics rests on the non-rational (非理性) pursuit of constancy (恒常). This genealogy is closer to Nietzsche than Kant, though the framework remains transcendental in structure.\n\n---\n\n## 形而上 (xíng ér shàng)\n- **Main translation**: The metaphysical / metaphysical construct(s)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Metaphysical structure\" when referring to systematic constructions\n  - \"Supra-phenomenal\" to emphasize the beyond-phenomenon aspect\n  - \"Abstract concept\" in simpler contexts\n- **Note**: A property or construct that stands \"above\" phenomena—any concept, category, or structure abstracted from 现象. The author reinterprets 形 as 现象 (phenomenon) rather than the traditional reading, making 形而上 literally \"that which is above/upon phenomena.\" This is NOT ontologically prior but epistemically derivative—built UP from phenomena, though traditionally *understood* as descending DOWN to generate phenomena. The author identifies three types: 第〇种 (recognition of repeated patterns), 第一种 (predictive generalizations), 第二种 (abstraction into concepts). The core of all 形而上 is 恒常 (constancy)—the pursuit of invariant structure amid change. In Kantian terms, this includes both empirical concepts and pure concepts (categories), but the author's framework does not distinguish them as sharply. The author's universal property (泛性质) definition from category theory: 形而上 is a universal property in a subcategory of E (境).\n\n---\n\n## 后形而上学 (hòu xíng ér shàng xué)\n- **Main translation**: Post-metaphysics\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Post-metaphysical thought\" when referring to the approach\n  - \"After metaphysics\" for literal emphasis\n- **Note**: Metaphysics *after* nihilism—after the recognition that 第〇实在 has no special epistemic privilege and that the pursuit of ultimate ground is non-rational. This is NOT anti-metaphysical or a rejection of 形而上; rather, it is metaphysics with explicit recognition that all metaphysical constructs are built from 现象 upward, not given from above. The key moves: (1) disenchantment (祛魅) of 第〇实在; (2) recognition of the non-rational (非理性) drive underlying metaphysical construction; (3) acknowledgment that 现象 occupies the structurally primary position. The method is 实践 (practice)—the \"overlap of ideal and phenomenon\" (理想和现象之重叠). This parallels Kant's limitation of metaphysics in CPR but goes further: Kant cordons off noumena while maintaining their regulative function; the author accepts the non-rationality at the foundation and builds post-metaphysics as deliberate, acknowledged construction. Closer to Nietzsche's \"gay science\" or pragmatist/constructivist approaches, but retaining transcendental structure.\n\n---\n\n## 先验 (xiān yàn)\n- **Main translation**: A priori / transcendental (context-dependent)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"A priori\" when referring to knowledge independent of experience\n  - \"Transcendental\" when referring to conditions of possibility of experience\n  - Keep Chinese term with gloss in highly technical passages\n- **Note**: Standard translation of Kant's *a priori* (prior to experience) and *transzendental* (concerning conditions of possibility). In the K1 strategy essay, the author writes: \"如果你认为这一时刻是某种E_t首次出现的时刻...则你可以将这种稳定结构当中的这一部分认定为'先天'\" (If you consider this the moment of E_t's first appearance, independent of experience, you may identify this part of the stable structure as \"a priori\"). The author's S_E (stable structure preserved under evolution functor T) plays the role of Kantian a priori structures—forms of intuition and categories—but the author leaves S_E formally unspecified and proposes to discover it empirically through \"philosophical experiments.\" This is methodologically post-Kantian: the *form* of synthetic a priori knowledge, but the *content* left to empirical investigation. The author deliberately withholds Kant's strong modal claims while retaining the structural insight.\n\n---\n\n## 范畴 (fànchóu)\n- **Main translation**: Category (context determines mathematical or philosophical sense)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Category\" (mathematical category theory) in technical passages\n  - \"Category of understanding\" when explicitly invoking Kant\n  - Distinguish by capitalization or context\n- **Note**: Dual usage: (1) Philosophical—Kant's *Kategorien*, the pure concepts of understanding that structure experience (substance, causality, etc.); (2) Mathematical—category theory (范畴论), the formal language the author uses to describe the structure of 境. The author's major innovation: replacing Kant's table of twelve categories (derived from logical forms of judgment) with category-theoretic structures. Universal properties (泛性质) replace Kantian categories; functors replace schematism; natural transformations replace synthetic unity of apperception. This is structure-first rather than logic-first. The advantage: formal precision and generativity beyond Kant's discursive formulations. The shift: from Kant's fixed categories to dynamically evolving cognitive structures described by functors.\n\n---\n\n## 构造 (gòuzào)\n- **Main translation**: Construction / constitute (verb: construct)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Constitution\" when emphasizing transcendental constitution\n  - \"Building\" in simpler contexts\n  - \"Synthesis\" when the Kantian parallel is explicit\n- **Note**: The process by which 第二实在 is built up from 第一实在; the generation of structured 境 from raw phenomena. Parallels Kant's *synthesis*—the activity of the understanding that combines the manifold of intuition into unified experience. However, the author's usage is broader and more dynamic: construction includes not just cognitive synthesis but practical, linguistic, and cultural construction. The author's \"construction\" (构造) in category theory refers to the *塔式构造* (tower construction) by which higher-order structures emerge from lower-order ones. This formalizes what Kant described discursively: how concepts of increasing generality/abstraction arise from more concrete contents. The key difference: the author treats construction as ongoing, revisable, and multiple (different constructions possible), whereas Kant's synthesis via the categories is fixed and universal.\n\n---\n\n## 综合 (zōnghé)\n- **Main translation**: Synthesis / synthetic\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Combination\" in non-technical contexts\n  - \"Synthetic judgment\" when discussing knowledge claims\n- **Note**: Kant's *Synthesis*—the act of combining different representations and grasping their manifoldness in one cognition. In Kant, synthesis is the fundamental operation of understanding; all knowledge involves synthesis of intuitions under concepts. The author uses this term in parallel sense: the subjective synthesis of phenomena to produce meaning. In the appendix essay, the author writes: \"一件事物的意义是什么这一问题的回答可能是一种知识（即可能是一种先天综合判断）...通过对现象的主观综合而来\" (The answer to \"what does X mean\" may be a kind of knowledge—synthetic a priori judgment—arising through subjective synthesis of phenomena). This extends Kant's synthetic a priori from mathematics/natural science to the domain of meaning. The framework: meaning has the same epistemic structure as scientific knowledge—it emerges from structural conditions (S_E) through which experience is constituted, not from bare experience or pure concepts alone.\n\n---\n\n## 分析 (fēnxī)\n- **Main translation**: Analysis / analytic\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Analytical judgment\" in epistemological contexts\n  - \"Decomposition\" when emphasizing the breaking-down aspect\n- **Note**: Kant's *Analytik* and *analytische Urteile* (analytic judgments)—judgments in which the predicate is contained in the concept of the subject (e.g., \"All bachelors are unmarried\"). Contrasts with synthetic judgments, which add new information. Kant's critical question: \"How are synthetic a priori judgments possible?\" The author adopts this distinction in discussing knowledge but focuses primarily on the synthetic—how new understanding arises. The author's main concern is with construction (synthesis), not decomposition (analysis), though both are operative in the formation and clarification of concepts.\n\n---\n\n## 境 (jìng)\n- **Main translation**: Jing (keep untranslated with gloss) / experiential realm\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Experiential realm\" as translation\n  - \"Field of experience\" in some contexts\n  - \"Lifeworld\" if invoking Husserl\n  - \"境-structure\" when emphasizing the formal structure\n- **Note**: The central concept. E (境) = Enclosed + Emotion + Experience. The structured totality of experience at a moment—现象 with structure imposed on it. In category theory: 境 is a category whose objects are selected from phenomena (感受) and whose morphisms are associations (联想, also 感受). Critically, morphisms are also objects (making E a tower structure / arrows-only metacategory). No direct Kantian equivalent, but resonates with several concepts: Husserl's \"field of consciousness,\" Heidegger's \"world\" (*Welt*), Kant's \"unity of apperception\" as the unified field of experience. The Buddhist/Chinese aesthetic term 境界 (realm, state of mind) underlies this usage. The author's innovation: formalizing this with category theory to describe both the structure and its evolution (via functor T). In Kantian terms, 境 is experience *as structured by the subject*, but the author does not presume Kant's specific forms (space/time) or categories. Instead, the structure is to be discovered empirically. Recommended: Keep \"Jing\" untranslated in the main translation with explanatory notes, using \"experiential realm\" or \"境-structure\" where clarification is needed.\n\n---\n\n## 恒常 (héngcháng)\n- **Main translation**: Constancy\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Permanence\" when invoking Kant's First Analogy explicitly\n  - \"Invariance\" in mathematical/formal contexts\n  - \"Stability\" when discussing stable structures\n- **Note**: The core of all 形而上—the pursuit of invariant structure amid phenomenal change. The author writes: \"形而上的核心是恒常\" (The core of the metaphysical is constancy). This is what we seek when we form concepts, make predictions, abstract generalizations—a \"guarantee\" (保证) that the same structures will recur. In Kantian terms, this resonates with the First Analogy of Experience—the principle of the permanence of substance (CPR A182/B224). For Kant, permanence is a transcendental condition: without something permanent in intuition, no time-determination is possible, hence no experience. The author's 恒常 is both the *object* of metaphysical pursuit and the *structural feature* preserved by evolution functor T in stable structure S_E. This is the non-rational drive (非理性) underlying all cognition: the need for \"handles\" (抓手) on phenomena to make meaningful action possible. Translation: \"constancy\" avoids the excessive Kantian specificity of \"permanence\" while preserving the sense of temporal/structural invariance.\n\n---\n\n## 感受 (gǎnshòu)\n- **Main translation**: Feeling / sensation (context-dependent)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Sensory experience\" when emphasizing empirical input\n  - \"Affective experience\" when emphasizing emotion\n  - \"Experiential content\" in formal contexts\n- **Note**: The fundamental unit of P (现象). The author writes: \"即便对于客观世界模型来说，任何对于我们有影响的事物都必须通过'感受'或者'体验'以'进入'我们的'视野'以成为'现象'\" (Even for the objective world model, anything that affects us must enter our view through \"feeling\" or \"experience\" to become \"phenomenon\"). This is phenomenologically immediate—the raw \"what it is like\" of experience. Closer to the sensory \"matter\" of appearance in Kant's terminology, or to *Empfindung* (sensation), but without Kant's sharp form/matter distinction. The author treats 感受 as both objects and morphisms in E—both the contents of experience and the associative links between them. This anticipates the tower structure of 境. Translation: \"feeling\" for affective/phenomenological contexts; \"sensation\" when emphasizing sensory input; clarify with context.\n\n---\n\n## 经验 (jīngyàn)\n- **Main translation**: Experience\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Empirical experience\" when contrasting with a priori\n  - \"Experiential\" (adjective)\n- **Note**: Kant's *Erfahrung*—structured, unified cognition of phenomena. For Kant, experience is always already synthesized by the understanding via the categories; it is not mere perception but cognition of objects in accordance with rules. The author uses 经验 similarly—experience as structured by 境, not raw phenomena. However, the author's framework allows for more radical variability in experiential structure across individuals and developmental stages (via different S_E), whereas Kant insists on universal forms. The author's post-metaphysical stance: experience is the starting point (第一实在) and the site of all construction, but its structure is not deduced a priori (as in Kant) but investigated empirically through \"philosophical experiments.\"\n\n---\n\n## 体验 (tǐyàn)\n- **Main translation**: Lived experience / concrete experience\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Experiential episode\" for individual instances\n  - \"Experiencing\" (gerund) to emphasize process\n- **Note**: Often synonymous with 感受 in the author's usage but with a more holistic connotation—the *living through* of experience, not just isolated sensations. Closer to Husserl's *Erlebnis* (lived experience) or Dilthey's *Erleben*. The author uses 体验 and 感受 somewhat interchangeably to denote the contents of 现象/P. In contexts where distinction matters, 体验 suggests richer, more integrated experiential episodes (e.g., aesthetic experience, emotional states), while 感受 can refer to more elementary sensory/affective units. Translation flexibility: use \"lived experience\" for phenomenological emphasis, \"experience\" in general usage.\n\n---\n\n## 非理性 (fēi lǐxìng)\n- **Main translation**: The non-rational\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Non-rational drive\" when referring to the underlying impulse\n  - \"Arational\" to emphasize not anti-rational but outside reason's scope\n- **Note**: NOT \"irrational\" (which implies opposition to reason or irrationality as defect). \"Non-rational\" indicates something outside reason's domain but not thereby condemned. The author's critical claim: \"理性的目的必然要在理性之外...理性仅仅作为一种工具而存在\" (Reason's purpose must lie outside reason...reason exists only as a tool). Therefore: \"对终极实在的追求本身就是非理性的（形而上学本身就是非理性的）\" (The pursuit of ultimate reality is itself non-rational; metaphysics itself is non-rational). The drive for 恒常 (constancy), for \"handles\" on phenomena, for self-realization through practice—all are 非理性. This must be *acknowledged* (承认), not overcome. This marks a departure from Kant: for Kant, reason's demand for the unconditioned (the Ideas of Reason) is *rational*, even if it cannot be satisfied theoretically. The author's genealogy is closer to Nietzsche (the will to power underlying reason) or Schopenhauer (the Will underlying representation). However, the author does not valorize the non-rational over the rational; instead, post-metaphysics *acknowledges* both and works with them in 实践.\n\n---\n\n## 理性 (lǐxìng)\n- **Main translation**: Reason / rationality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Rational faculty\" when referring to Kant's *Vernunft*\n  - \"The rational\" as substantive\n- **Note**: Kant's *Vernunft* (Reason) vs. *Verstand* (Understanding). In Kant's architecture, Understanding applies categories to intuitions to produce experience; Reason seeks systematic unity and generates the Ideas (God, freedom, immortality). The author uses 理性 more generally for the capacity for conceptual thought, inference, justification—the \"rational\" dimension of cognition. The key post-metaphysical move: reason is a *tool* (工具), and its purposes are non-rational (非理性). This deflates reason from its Kantian status as the source of necessary structures (categories) and regulative ideals (Ideas) to a means in service of non-rational ends. However, the author does not abandon rational inquiry; rather, post-metaphysics acknowledges that reason operates within bounds set by non-rational drives (for constancy, self-realization) and returns to phenomena through practice.\n\n---\n\n## 超越 (chāoyuè)\n- **Main translation**: Transcendence / to transcend\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Surpassing\" when emphasizing the movement beyond\n  - \"Going beyond\" in simpler contexts\n- **Note**: Going beyond current limits—of experience, of the self, of a given 境. The author distinguishes: (1) 超越 of the 境界 (boundary) of thought—moving from one cognitive/experiential structure to another (e.g., via evolution functor T); (2) The unattainable 超越 toward 第〇实在, which is non-rational and always transforms into 第二实在 when articulated. In Kantian terms, *transzendental* (transcendental) refers to conditions of possibility of experience; *transzendent* (transcendent) refers to what lies beyond possible experience. The author's usage is closer to the latter—transcendence as the movement beyond a given boundary. However, post-metaphysics recognizes that we cannot transcend phenomena themselves (第一实在), only move from one structured configuration (境) to another. The author's notion of 超越 is more akin to Heidegger's *Überstieg* or existentialist notions of self-overcoming than to Kant's transcendental method.\n\n---\n\n## 超越性 (chāoyuè xìng)\n- **Main translation**: Transcendence (substantive) / transcendent quality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Transcendent dimension\" when referring to what lies beyond\n  - \"The transcendent\" as philosophical term\n- **Note**: The quality or dimension of what lies beyond (a 境, a framework, the self). The author writes: \"超越之所在是（可以）存在的\" (Transcendence can exist), but it is not directly accessible—we encounter only its \"results\" (the phenomena that are \"放入篮子,\" placed in the basket). In Kantian terms, this is the transcendent realm (God, noumena, things-in-themselves)—posited but unknowable. The author's twist: we study the *manifestation* of transcendence (how phenomena change, how 境 evolves), not transcendence itself. This is the research program of K1 strategy: to study the evolution of 境 (via functor T) to understand how \"what enters the basket\" (what becomes phenomenon) structures experience. The author's 超越性 is not a separate ontological realm but the *dynamic* dimension of experience—the fact that 境 evolves, that new structures emerge, that we are not trapped in a static framework.\n\n---\n\n## 自然变换 (zìrán biànhuàn)\n- **Main translation**: Natural transformation\n- **Alternatives**: None (this is a technical term from category theory)\n- **Note**: A concept from mathematical category theory: a natural transformation η between two functors F and G (both from category C to D) assigns to each object X in C a morphism η_X: F(X) → G(X) in D, such that for every morphism f: X → Y in C, the naturality condition holds: G(f) ∘ η_X = η_Y ∘ F(f). The author's philosophical application: a natural transformation between the evolution of formal structures (language, mathematics) and the evolution of experience (境) is the condition of *understanding*. When we \"understand\" a sentence, a formula, or a phenomenon, we establish a natural transformation linking the structural unfolding of that object with our experiential/cognitive process. The η morphisms represent the \"feeling of alignment\" (一致性感受) or \"confirmation\" (确认). When η is the identity morphism, we have *mastery* (掌握)—direct, immediate understanding without mediation. This is a profound formalization of what it means to \"get it\": the isomorphism (or at least systematic correspondence) between external structure and internal process. In Kantian terms, this formalizes the schematism—the mediating process between pure concepts and sensible intuitions—and extends it to meaning, aesthetics, and all understanding.\n\n---\n\n## 函子 (hánzǐ)\n- **Main translation**: Functor\n- **Alternatives**: None (technical term from category theory)\n- **Note**: A structure-preserving map between categories. A functor F: C → D maps objects of C to objects of D and morphisms of C to morphisms of D, preserving composition and identities. The author's key application: the evolution functor T: E_t → E_{t+1} describes how 境 changes over \"time\" (t need not be physical time—any label for developmental/processual stages). Various \"转换函子\" (transformation functors) map between subcategories: F_{E,L} embeds language-境 into total 境; F_{L→K} maps language to knowledge; etc. Functors formalize processes: learning, understanding, conceptual development, structural change. This is the author's major methodological innovation beyond Kant: Kant's framework is static (the categories do not evolve); the author introduces dynamics via functors. This allows for developmental psychology, historical/cultural variation in cognitive structures, and individual differences—all within a transcendental-style framework.\n\n---\n\n## 稳定结构 (wěndìng jiégòu)\n- **Main translation**: Stable structure\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Invariant structure\" when emphasizing what is preserved\n  - \"Structural invariant\" in mathematical contexts\n- **Note**: The structure S_E preserved under the evolution functor T—what remains constant as 境 evolves. This is the formal counterpart to 恒常 (constancy). The author's conjecture: there exists a stable structure S_E such that T(S_E) ≅ S_E (T preserves S_E, up to isomorphism). If S_E can be identified at the earliest stage E_{t_c}, it becomes a candidate for \"a priori cognitive structure\" (先天认知结构)—though the author is careful to note this is descriptive, not prescriptive, and requires empirical investigation via \"philosophical experiments.\" In Kantian terms, S_E corresponds to the forms of intuition (space/time) and categories of understanding—the necessary structures without which no experience could be constituted. The key differences from Kant: (1) S_E is not deduced from the table of judgments but conjectured and investigated; (2) S_E may vary across individuals/populations/developmental stages; (3) S_E is discovered by examining what structure remains invariant under T, not by transcendental deduction. This is the empirical-transcendental synthesis the author proposes: transcendental in form (conditions of possible experience), empirical in method (discovered through investigation of experiential evolution).\n\n---\n\n## 认知结构 (rènzhī jiégòu)\n- **Main translation**: Cognitive structure\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Epistemic structure\" when emphasizing knowledge\n  - \"Conceptual framework\" in less technical contexts\n- **Note**: The structural features of 境 that enable cognition. The author writes: \"如果你认为E表示了某种认知，那么假如能够证明这一稳定结构当中的一部分一旦缺失，则无法从P_t中构建任何E_t，则可以将这部分稳定结构称之为'认知结构'\" (If E represents cognition, and if it can be shown that without part of the stable structure, no E_t can be constructed from P_t, then this part may be called \"cognitive structure\"). This is a transcendental argument: X is a cognitive structure if X is a necessary condition for constructing 境 from phenomena. Parallel to Kant's categories as conditions of the possibility of experience. The author's framework allows for empirical investigation of what these structures are (via philosophical experiments across populations), whereas Kant deduces them a priori. In contemporary terms, this bridges transcendental philosophy and cognitive science—an empirical search for innate or developmentally necessary cognitive structures, but framed within a transcendental architecture (conditions of possibility).\n\n---\n\n## Additional Key Terms\n\n### 泛性质 (fàn xìngzhì)\n- **Main translation**: Universal property\n- **Note**: Technical term from category theory. An object X in category C has a universal property if every other object in C (or in a relevant subcategory) maps to/from X in a unique way. The author's definition of 形而上: \"一个形而上m是E中的联想，且m在E的某个子范畴中是范性质\" (A metaphysical construct m is a morphism in E, and m is a universal property in some subcategory of E). Example: the concept \"笔\" (pen) is a universal property in the subcategory of E containing 铅笔, 钢笔, 粉笔, etc. The \"feeling\" we get when seeing any pen is the universal property—the limit/terminal object toward which all specific pen-experiences map. This formalizes what Kant called the \"schema\" of a concept and what traditional metaphysics called the \"essence\" or \"universal.\"\n\n### 塔式结构 (tǎ shì jiégòu)\n- **Main translation**: Tower structure\n- **Note**: A category where morphisms are also objects, constructed iteratively: T_0 (base category) → T_1 (objects are morphisms of T_0) → T_2 (objects are objects and morphisms of T_1) → ... → T_∞. The author's 境 (E) is a tower structure because morphisms (associations, 联想) are also experiential contents (感受), hence also objects. This structure allows for meta-levels: thinking about thinking, concepts of concepts, associations between associations. This formalizes the reflexivity of consciousness and the hierarchical structure of abstraction. No direct Kantian parallel, but related to Fichte's reflexive self-positing of the I.\n\n### 实践 (shíjiàn)\n- **Main translation**: Practice / praxis\n- **Note**: The core methodological principle of post-metaphysics: \"理想和现象之重叠\" (the overlap of ideal and phenomenon). Through practice, we construct 境, test them against phenomena, and iterate. This is not Kant's \"practical reason\" (moral/volitional) but closer to pragmatist or Marxist praxis—the active, iterative engagement with the world that constitutes both self and world. Practice is how post-metaphysics avoids dogmatism: we acknowledge that all constructs are 第二实在 (Second Reality), and we test them through practice, revising as needed. This is the post-metaphysical answer to nihilism: not \"nothing matters\" but \"we construct what matters, and practice tests and refines our constructions.\"\n\n### 诗意 (shīyì)\n- **Main translation**: The poetic / poetic engagement\n- **Note**: The author's term for the proper stance after post-metaphysical recognition. \"清醒的梦境\" (lucid dreaming)—we construct and inhabit meaningful structures while knowing they are constructions. Not Kant's \"discipline of pure reason\" but closer to Nietzsche's \"gay science,\" Heidegger's \"poetic dwelling,\" or Daoist \"play\" (游). The poetic is the *freedom* to construct 境, to engage with experience creatively, aesthetically, meaningfully, without metaphysical illusion but also without nihilistic despair. This is the post-metaphysical resolution: neither dogmatic belief in 第〇实在 nor nihilistic rejection of all 形而上, but deliberate, acknowledged, joyful construction.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis dictionary provides translation recommendations grounded in the Kantian/transcendental philosophical tradition while acknowledging the author's innovations and divergences. The author's framework is recognizably transcendental in structure (phenomena → conditions of possibility → structured experience) but post-Kantian in method (empirical investigation, dynamic evolution, explicit acknowledgment of non-rationality). Translation should preserve both the Kantian resonances (for Western philosophical readers) and the author's original contributions (category-theoretic formalization, post-metaphysical stance, integration of Chinese philosophical concepts).\n\nFor the translation team: Consistency in rendering these key terms across all essays is critical. Where the author's usage diverges from standard Kantian vocabulary, translator's notes should clarify both the parallel and the difference. The goal is to make this work accessible to readers in the Western philosophical tradition while preserving its originality and rigor.\n\n---\n\n**Prepared by:** Kantian/Transcendental Philosophy Expert\n**Date:** 2026-02-10\n**For:** jing-translation team\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":152,"cache_read_input_tokens":71833,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":152},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CXzpJgUaVLeLYx5BzZAM3","type":"assistant","uuid":"c4e391b8-39cf-4723-9681-5897d0d4973e","timestamp":"2026-02-10T17:57:37.228Z"}

Legenravend/49 Workspace/Kantian/Dictionary.md`\n\n## Summary of the Translation Dictionary\n\nThe dictionary contains **25 major entries** covering the key philosophical terms in the 境集 essays, with each entry following your requested format:\n\n### Core Metaphysical Terms:\n- **现象** (Phenomenon) - Pre-constitutive experiential content, broader than Kant's Erscheinung\n- **第一实在** (First Reality) - The indubitable epistemic starting point  \n- **第〇实在** (Zeroth Reality) - Parallel to Kant's thing-in-itself/noumenon\n- **第二实在** (Second Reality) - Constructed conceptual reality\n- **形而上** (The metaphysical) - Constructs abstracted from phenomena\n- **形而上学** (Metaphysics) - The discipline studying the metaphysical\n- **后形而上学** (Post-metaphysics) - Metaphysics after nihilism, with acknowledged construction\n\n### Kantian/Transcendental Terms:\n- **先验** (A priori/transcendental) - Conditions of possibility, investigated empirically\n- **范畴** (Category) - Both Kantian categories and mathematical category theory\n- **构造** (Construction) - Synthesis of Second Reality from First Reality\n- **综合** (Synthesis) - Extends Kantian synthesis to the domain of meaning\n- **分析** (Analysis) - Kantian analytic judgments\n- **恒常** (Constancy) - Core of metaphysics, parallel to Kant's permanence\n- **经验** (Experience) - Structured cognition, Kant's Erfahrung\n- **认知结构** (Cognitive structure) - Necessary conditions for constructing 境\n\n### Central Framework Concepts:\n- **境** (Jing) - Experiential realm, structured totality of experience\n- **感受** (Feeling/sensation) - Fundamental units of phenomena\n- **体验** (Lived experience) - Holistic experiential episodes\n- **稳定结构** (Stable structure) - S_E preserved under evolution functor T\n\n### Post-Metaphysical Terms:\n- **非理性** (The non-rational) - Drive underlying metaphysics, must be acknowledged\n- **理性** (Reason) - Tool serving non-rational purposes\n- **超越** (Transcendence) - Movement beyond boundaries\n- **超越性** (Transcendent quality) - Dynamic dimension of experience\n- **实践** (Practice/praxis) - Overlap of ideal and phenomenon\n- **诗意** (The poetic) - Post-metaphysical stance of lucid construction\n\n### Mathematical/Category Theory Terms:\n- **自然变换** (Natural transformation) - Condition of understanding, formalizes schematism\n- **函子** (Functor) - Structure-preserving maps, enables dynamic framework\n- **泛性质** (Universal property) - Formalizes concepts/essences as terminal/initial objects\n- **塔式结构** (Tower structure) - Reflexive hierarchy where morphisms are objects\n\n## Key Insights for Translation\n\nThe dictionary emphasizes that:\n\n1. **The author's framework is transcendental in structure but post-Kantian in method** - it retains the form of synthetic a priori knowledge while leaving content to empirical investigation\n\n2. **Major innovation: Category theory replaces Kant's table of categories** - universal properties replace categories, functors replace schematism, natural transformations replace synthetic unity\n\n3. **The author extends Kantian architecture to meaning and value** - treating \"what does X mean?\" as another kind of Kantian question (synthetic a priori judgment about meaning)\n\n4. **Post-metaphysical disenchantment goes beyond Kant** - the pursuit of ultimate ground (第〇实在) is recognized as non-rational, whereas Kant maintains the noumenon as a necessary thought\n\n5. **Dynamic evolution via functors** - Unlike Kant's static categories, the author introduces T (evolution functor) allowing for developmental, cultural, and individual variation\n\nEach entry provides detailed notes on:\n- Relation to Kantian terminology (Erscheinung, Ding an sich, categories, etc.)\n- Points of parallel and divergence\n- Translation considerations for philosophical accuracy\n- Context-specific usage guidance\n\nThe dictionary serves as a comprehensive guide for maintaining philosophical rigor and consistency across the translation of all eight essays in the 境集 collection."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":8882,"cache_read_input_tokens":71985,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":8882},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CXzpawwCLe52JKGm9G6zB","type":"assistant","uuid":"1d252315-1e47-4cd4-ab34-0fc76b9252d9","timestamp":"2026-02-10T17:58:03.103Z"}
