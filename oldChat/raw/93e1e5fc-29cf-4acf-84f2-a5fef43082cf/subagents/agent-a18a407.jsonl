The earlier paragraph (line 16 of the original) already introduced this: \"metaphysics literally means 元物理 (meta-physics).\" When the author repeats 元物理 here, it is deliberate. Consider rendering as \"*meta-physics*\" (hyphenated) to preserve the etymological self-consciousness.

Consider adding the Chinese character: \"...and call it 'character' (德).\" This creates the explicit callback to the block quote where 德 appeared as \"virtue,\" making the reader register that the bottom-up construction has now produced the very concept that was presented top-down in the Laozi.\n\n4. **\"That which makes a person a person\" for 使得人而成为人的东西.** Translation is accurate. But consider using \"constitutes\" to bridge to TN3's \"(constitutive) character\": \"that is, 'character' (德): that which *constitutes* a person as a person.\" This creates a semantic link between the inline text and the TN's terminology.\n\n5. **\"Pursuing the branches and forgetting the root\" (逐末而忘本).** This works, but 本/末 (root/branches) is a philosophically loaded classical pair that maps onto the author's argument about forgetting the phenomenal ground.
