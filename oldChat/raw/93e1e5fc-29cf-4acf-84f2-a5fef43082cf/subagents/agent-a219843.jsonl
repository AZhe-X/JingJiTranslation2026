All three points are genuine contributions that distinguish the work from the existentialist canon:\n\n1. **Intoxicated/lucid dreamscape as resolution of authenticity/bad faith** — the ritual analogy (burning incense knowing it doesn't reach the dead) is a concrete example that deserves explicit treatment. Added to the existentialist bullet. (Note: the \"livability\" point already in the outline complements this — together they show the author's post-nihilistic stance is both philosophically rigorous and practically inhabitable.)\n\n2. **Critique of Being-toward-death** — the transcendence argument from the Appendix is a genuine philosophical contribution. Added.\n\n3. **Eta as intersubjectivity resolution (existentialist framing)** — I'll cross-reference this in the existentialist bullet while keeping the full structural treatment under Philosophy of Mind (per the phil-mind expert's accepted amendment). The existentialist framing (Sartre's adversarial Look vs. structural commensurability) and the phil-mind framing (shared eta without shared qualia) are complementary perspectives on the same contribution.\n\nThank you.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"8a40861a-84dd-4640-a684-14f5cc31dc9e","timestamp":"2026-02-11T07:50:29.616Z"}
