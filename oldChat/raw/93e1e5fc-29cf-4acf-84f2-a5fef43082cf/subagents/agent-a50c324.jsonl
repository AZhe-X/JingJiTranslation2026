The delivery timing is correct — general prompts first, targeted checks last. The non-leading principle for the Critical Experiential Checks (line 65) is exactly right. Here are my suggestions.\n\n---\n\n**1. The general per-essay questions are strong. Keep them as-is.**\n\nThe five questions (lines 28-32) cover comprehension, experiential shifts, confusion diagnosis, experiential-vs-argumentative character, and engagement. This is a good template. I would not change it.\n\n**2. On essay-specific questions: YES, but with strict constraints.**\n\nEssay-specific questions would be valuable because the general template will miss things that only matter for particular essays. However, they carry real priming risk if delivered before or during reading. The protocol already handles this by delivering questions *after* each essay — so the priming risk is limited to affecting how the reader *remembers and reports* the experience, not the experience itself. This is acceptable.\n\n**Constraint:** Essay-specific questions should be phrased as open-ended follow-ups to the reader's general response, not as leading probes. They should ask the reader to elaborate on something, not to confirm something we expect.\n\n**Proposed essay-specific follow-ups (delivered after general response for each essay):**\n\n- **Essay 1:** \"The essay uses a physics analogy (renormalization/ocean waves). Did this help, confuse, or seem irrelevant?\" — Tests whether the physics-as-philosophical-work claim in the Preface holds for a non-physicist reader.\n\n- **Essay 2:** \"This essay was written in English by the author, not translated. Did you notice a difference in how it felt to read compared to Essay 1? If so, what kind of difference?\" — Tests the bilingual register claim.\n\n- **Essay 3:** No essay-specific question needed here. The Critical Experiential Check at the end (\"What happened to your experience across the three examples?\") already covers this essay perfectly. Adding a question right after Essay 3 risks double-probing and making the reader self-conscious about their response.\n\n- **Essay 4:** \"The essay introduces several Chinese philosophical terms (道, 德, 仁, 义, 礼). Did you follow the argument through the Chinese terms, or did they become obstacles?\" — Tests whether the glossing conventions work in practice. Also: \"Did the translator's notes help or interrupt your reading?\"\n\n- **Essay 5:** \"The essay introduces 'the Poetic' (诗意) and the distinction between intoxicated and lucid dreamscapes. Did these concepts make sense to you? Could you explain the distinction in your own words?\" — Tests whether the author's central positive proposal is communicable to a non-specialist.\n\n- **Essay 6:** \"This essay introduces the category theory framework. At what point (if any) did the mathematics become difficult to follow? Did the magic book examples help you past the difficulty?\" — Tests the author's claim that examples carry the content independently.\n\n- **Essay 7:** \"This is the most technically demanding essay. Were there sections you skipped or skimmed? Did you feel you understood the main ideas even if the notation was opaque?\" — Tests the Preface's reading advice about letting notation wash over you.\n\n- **Appendix:** \"This is described as 'supplementary reflections.' Did it feel like a conclusion, a collection of loose thoughts, or something else?\" — Tests whether the Appendix's character comes through.\n\n**3. Add a question about the Preface after the full collection.**\n\nAfter the reader finishes everything and submits their collection-level report, but before the final prompts, add: \"Now that you've read everything, was there anything in the Preface that turned out to be misleading, or that you wish had been different?\" This tests our spoiler resolution — did the Preface set up the right expectations without pre-interpreting?\n\n**4. The Critical Experiential Checks are excellent as-is.**\n\nThe three checks (Essays 3, 4, 7) target the three experiential sequences highlighted in the Preface. The phrasing is properly non-leading. I would add one more:\n\n- **Essay 5:** \"When you read about the 'lucid dreamscape' — knowing you're in a dream but being fully invested — did that connect to anything in your own experience?\" — This tests whether the Poetic, the collection's central positive proposal, actually resonates experientially for a non-specialist. If it doesn't, that's critical information.\n\n**5. Minor: clarify \"1-2 pages\" in the collection-level report.**\n\nLine 36 says \"1-2 pages.\" For the reader, specify a word count (e.g., 300-600 words) rather than page count, since they'll be writing digitally.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The protocol is sound. Main additions: (a) essay-specific follow-ups as described above, (b) a Preface retrospective question after full collection, (c) an Essay 5 experiential check, (d) word count instead of page count. No structural changes needed.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"725fce57-4a9f-4abd-bdcd-00bf542c5074","timestamp":"2026-02-11T08:50:50.548Z"}
