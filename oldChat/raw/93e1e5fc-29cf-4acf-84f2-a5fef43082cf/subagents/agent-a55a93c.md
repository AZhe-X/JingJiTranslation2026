*Debate: righteousness vs rightness for 义*

Debate request: "righteousness" vs "rightness" for 义 (yi).

Current dictionary: "rightness" (main), based on Chinese-phil-expert's recommendation that "righteousness is too moralistic."

The author treats 义 as the motivational bridge between inner feeling (仁) and outward action (礼) — a 推动力 (driving force). Not purely moral judgment but the impulse that moves you from feeling to action.

Standard Laozi translations use "righteousness" (Chan, Ivanhoe) or "rectitude" (Lau).

We just established that the block quote needs English words with semantic weight — words the reader FEELS — so the philosophical experiment works. "Righteousness" carries heavy moral-religious associations in English (biblical righteousness, self-righteousness, righteous anger). "Rightness" is lighter, more neutral, closer to "correctness."

Question: Which serves the translation better?
- "Righteousness" — more loaded, more to deconstruct, standard in Laozi translations
- "Rightness" — less moralistic, closer to the author's usage as motivational bridge rather than moral judgment

Debate. Brief responses.

  "content": "This is a genuine tension and I think the answer is split by context.\n\nFor the block quote: \"righteousness\" is stronger. We just committed to the principle that the block quote needs semantically loaded English so the reader has something to feel and then lose. \"Righteousness\" delivers that — it activates biblical and moral associations, gives the reader a foothold, and makes the subsequent deconstruction hit harder. \"Rightness\" is too thin to deconstruct; it is almost already deconstructed.\n\nFor the author's analysis: \"rightness\" is better. Once the author is working with 义 as a motivational bridge — a 推动力 between inner feeling and outward action — the heavy moral baggage of \"righteousness\" becomes misleading.
