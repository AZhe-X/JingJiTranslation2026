All points addressed:\n\n1. **Property→definition / svabhava parallel** — Noted and agreed: no Buddhist cross-reference added. The structural parallel is preserved without importing external framework.\n\n2. **\"Generated\" italicization** — Already italicized at line 36 (\"everything that follows from it is *generated*\"), marking the conventional reading that will be deconstructed.\n\n3. **\"Buried from view\"** — Retained as-is. Glad the concealment-not-destruction nuance comes through.\n\n4. **逐末而忘本** — Kept without gloss. The metaphor is legible in English.\n\n5. **Footnote 24** — Already changed to \"that which enables existence to stand\" and \"paper\" (replacing \"canvas\"). Your point about avoiding the Kantian \"conditions of possibility\" overtone was well taken — this was also flagged by the Wittgenstein expert independently.\n\n6. **Block quote / paragraph breaks** — Confirmed as-is.\n\nNo new changes needed from your review. The draft is fully updated.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"cf96ce3a-9676-4ac8-84a8-f883fea3a5b4","timestamp":"2026-02-11T03:38:08.041Z"}
