**Quick question on footnote [^3] — "impels" vs "moves"**

Phenomenology flagged that footnote [^3] still has "impels" while the body text was changed to "moves me to want to."

But the two Chinese originals are different:
- **Body text** (line 24): 使得我**想要**去如何如何地对待他人 — "makes me **want to** treat the other..." → softer, hence "moves me to want to"
- **Footnote [^3]** (line 136): 这个感受使得（**推动**）我去做一些行为 — "this feeling makes (**pushes/impels**) me to do certain things" → stronger, 推动 = push/drive

Should "impels" stay in footnote [^3] since the original Chinese is actually stronger there (推动 vs 想要)? Or should we harmonize to "moves" for consistency?

Reply to team-lead: **KEEP "impels"** or **CHANGE to "moves"**, with brief reasoning.

Let me verify the exact Chinese for both passages.

Good. The footnote Chinese says: "这个感受使得（推动）我去做一些行为" — "this feeling makes (pushes/drives) me to do certain things." The 推动 in parentheses is explicitly stronger — it's the same root as 推动力 (driving force).

The body text (line 24) says: "这个感受使得我想要去如何如何地对待他人" — "this feeling makes me *want to* treat the other in such-and-such a way." 想要 = want to. Softer.

The two passages use genuinely different language. The footnote is where the author introduces the technical term 推动力 and is deliberately using stronger language to build toward that term.

Voted **KEEP "impels"** with reasoning grounded in the original Chinese. The two passages use genuinely different language (想要 vs 推动), and the translation correctly mirrors this distinction.
