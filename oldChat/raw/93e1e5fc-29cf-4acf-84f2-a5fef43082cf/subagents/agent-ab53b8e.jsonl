Your reasoning on flags 5 and 6 is sound — the parallel structure and the distancing \"is said to be\" are both well-justified. The YAML header update to DRAFT-R2 is pending (file edits are currently restricted); I'll update it when permissions allow.\n\nI see Task #30 (Essay 3) is now in progress. A few reminders for this draft:\n\n1. The experiential arc is the #1 priority: Sisyphus (mythic/dramatic) -> office worker (modern/relatable) -> cat owner (intimate/mundane). The de-escalation in dramatic register IS the philosophical argument. Each step must feel less grand than the last.\n\n2. The interrupted thought at the end of the office worker section (\"而上述例子中的人则还尚未——\") followed by \"但是等一等\" is a performative rhetorical device. The reader must feel the pivot.\n\n3. The cat passage is the philosophical climax precisely because it is anticlimactic. Keep it plain, warm, specific. The simplicity is the payoff.\n\n4. If you need expert consultation on any term (absurdity, alienation, the off-tone), the existentialism-expert and chinese-phil-expert are available.\n\nGood luck with this one — it's the essay the whole standby reader test hinges on.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"5715a275-0043-4856-88aa-20c01c5d1a5e","timestamp":"2026-02-11T09:00:21.381Z"}
