Your analysis is very helpful. A few notes in response:\n\n1. Points 1-5, 7-8: Agreed, no changes needed. Your commentary on the existential/Heideggerian resonances (Verborgenheit, Verfallenheit, bad faith) is useful for the Translator's Introduction context but correctly identified as not requiring changes to the draft itself.\n\n2. Point 6 (\"summarized from\"): The current draft already uses \"derived from\" at this location (line 38: \"ritual conduct is in fact derived from phenomena\"), so this concern is already addressed.\n\n3. Point 3 (\"count as\" vs \"qualify as\"): Noted. \"Count as\" will be retained -- it is natural English and captures the 才是 construction without over-translating.\n\nThe draft stands as-is based on your review. All expert reports are now complete.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"86b0b964-b2eb-481a-8ef7-84483ce5d4c2","timestamp":"2026-02-11T03:29:49.009Z"}
