*Confirm: add Afterword + move spoilers from Preface*

ALL TEAM MEMBERS:

Confirm the following two decisions:

1. **Add a Translator's Afterword** — placed after all essays and the Appendix, before the Glossary. It will cover cross-traditional connections, translation choices, and scholarly positioning — all the things that would be spoilers in front matter.

2. **Move the spoiler content from the Preface to the Afterword** — specifically the structural claims paragraph (line 50: nihilism-as-consequence, absurdity dissolution + mechanism) and soften the Essay 3 punchline in the Experiential Sequences section. The Preface names topics without revealing conclusions; the Afterword discusses them freely.

Vote: **AGREE** or **DISAGREE** (with reason).
