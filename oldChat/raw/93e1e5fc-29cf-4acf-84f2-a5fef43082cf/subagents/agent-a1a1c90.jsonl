The thinking is that if 德 requires this much translation apparatus (constitutive character, TNs, glosses, etc.), maybe the whole passage would work better with a Western example that English readers already understand — and keep the Chinese example only in a TN or appendix.\n\nWhat do you think? Is this a good idea or a bad idea? Brief response.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"3f4be758-92f4-44d6-a06a-eadabc63a95d","timestamp":"2026-02-11T01:52:19.638Z"}
