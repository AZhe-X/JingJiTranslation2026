*Vote: move What to Report to standalone file*

Vote requested: Should we move the "What to Report" section (lines 65-95 of the Standby Reader Profile) out of the Profile.md and into a standalone file?

The reasoning: Profile.md will be used as the prompt to generate/spawn the reader agent. If "What to Report" (including the per-essay questions, final prompts, and critical experiential checks) is part of that prompt, the reader will see all those questions BEFORE reading — which could bias their experience (e.g., knowing they'll be asked "What happened to your experience across the three examples?" for Essay 3 could prime them to watch for it).

Moving it to a standalone file means we can give the reader the profile (role, personality, reading instructions) at spawn, and then deliver the reporting questions AFTER they finish reading each piece — keeping the reading experience uncontaminated.

Vote YES to move "What to Report" to a standalone file, or NO to keep it in the profile. Brief reasoning please.

If the reader knows in advance that they will be asked \"What happened to your experience across the three examples?\" for Essay 3, they will adopt a monitoring stance toward their own reading -- watching for the shift rather than undergoing it. This is the difference between lived experience and introspective observation, and it is precisely the difference between a valid experiential report and a contaminated one.\n\nThe collection itself depends on this distinction.

Vote sent. The core argument: pre-loading reporting questions would impose an external monitoring stance that contaminates the very experiential data we need to collect. The reader would watch for shifts rather than undergo them -- the phenomenological equivalent of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle applied to reading. The correct protocol delivers questions AFTER each reading segment, preserving the experience-first, reflection-second structure that mirrors the collection's own Fish/Fishing design.
