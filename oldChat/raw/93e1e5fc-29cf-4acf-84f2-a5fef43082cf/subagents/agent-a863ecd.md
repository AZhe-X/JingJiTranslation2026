*Review proposed translator profile*

DISCUSSION: Proposed profile for the dedicated philosophical translator agent. Please review and respond with whether you AGREE, or if you want to ADD, CHANGE, or REMOVE anything.

Proposed profile:
1. Native-level command of both Chinese and English
2. Philosophical training (not purely literary)
3. Literary sensibility (not purely academic)
4. Category theory / mathematical notation literacy
5. Experience with register shifts (colloquial ↔ technical ↔ poetic)
6. Translator models: Burton Watson, A.C. Graham, Brook Ziporyn

Please respond with:
- AGREE (if you're satisfied with the profile as-is)
- Or specific additions/changes/removals with justification

This is discussion time -- if you disagree with another expert's suggestion, say so. We want consensus before proceeding.

Vote and profile review submitted. I agreed with the proposed translator profile and added two items:

1. **Explicit awareness of Buddhist translation conventions** (Sanskrit -> Chinese -> English chain) -- because the Buddhist vocabulary layer is pervasive in these essays and translation choices can have unintended Buddhist implications.

2. **A comparative philosophy translator model** (Wing-tsit Chan or journal translators from *Dao*/*Philosophy East and West*) alongside Watson/Graham/Ziporyn -- because the essays mix classical Chinese, modern Western-in-Chinese, and coined terminology, unlike the purely classical texts those three translators worked with.

Standing by for next steps.
