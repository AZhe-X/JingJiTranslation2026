*梦境 contains 境 — should translation preserve this link?*

Question from the author: 梦境 contains the character 境 — the same 境 as in the title 境集 and the central concept 境 (Jing). But "dreamscape" (and most proposed translations) doesn't capture this connection. The reader of the English text would not see that 梦境 literally contains 境.

Does this matter? Should the translation of 梦境 somehow preserve the 境 connection? If so, how?

Brief responses welcome. This is a real translation problem.

The etymological link is the conceptual link: a 梦境 is a *kind of* 境. The reader of the Chinese text sees this immediately -- 梦境 is literally \"dream-境.\" When the author later introduces 境 as the central concept, the Chinese reader already has the intuition: \"ah, 境 is the general case of what 梦境 was a specific instance of.\"\n\nIf this link is invisible in English, the reader loses the developmental arc of the concept.

Sent my response. The key argument: the link between 梦境 and 境 is architecturally significant, not incidental -- 梦境 is how 境 first enters the collection, and the Chinese reader immediately sees the general concept inside the specific term. Whatever English rendering we choose for 境, all compounds containing 境 (梦境, 境界, 意境) must visibly contain the same root in English. If 境 = Jing, then 梦境 = dream-jing. Consistency is essential.
