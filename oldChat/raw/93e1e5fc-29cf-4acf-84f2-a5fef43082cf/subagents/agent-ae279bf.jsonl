But \"dreamscape\" (and most proposed translations) doesn't capture this connection. The reader of the English text would not see that 梦境 literally contains 境.\n\nDoes this matter? Should the translation of 梦境 somehow preserve the 境 connection? If so, how?\n\nBrief responses welcome. This is a real translation problem.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"20b01124-1876-49b0-b568-fd5974a602e3","timestamp":"2026-02-10T22:46:45.544Z"}
