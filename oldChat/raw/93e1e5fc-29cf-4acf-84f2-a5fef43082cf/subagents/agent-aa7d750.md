*Final vote on English word for 德*

The author wants a final answer. Given that we all agree on the 文言 format convention:

- First occurrence: "English (德 De)"
- Running text thereafter: plain English word

The question is ONLY: what English word fills that slot?

You gave 7 different answers last round. Now that you've seen everyone else's arguments, give your FINAL single recommendation. Pick ONE from this list (or propose one new option with justification):

1. virtue
2. character
3. inherent character
4. defining character
5. defining nature
6. constitutive nature
7. nature
8. No English word — just "De" in running text

One word/phrase. No hedging. Final answer.
