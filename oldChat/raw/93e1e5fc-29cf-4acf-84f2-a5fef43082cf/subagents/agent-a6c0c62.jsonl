Would a philosophy of language expert materially help the non-category-theory essays?**\n\nNo, not materially. The non-category-theory essays do not engage with philosophy of language as a discipline. They use language *about* existential themes, but they do not theorize about language itself. The key terms in my domain -- 荒谬, 虚无, 诗意, 梦境, 沉醉/清醒, 超越性 -- are existential-phenomenological terms, not terms from philosophy of language. Their translation challenges are about capturing the right existential register (e.g., Camus's *absurde* vs. colloquial \"ridiculous\"), not about linguistic theory.\n\nThe one partial exception is the 梦境 (dreamscape) concept in 形而上学后的目的：诗意. The author describes dreamscapes as \"environments\" in which meaning arises, and draws analogies to games, novels, and rituals. A philosopher of language might note connections to speech act theory (rituals as performative utterances) or to Wittgenstein's forms of life. But these connections are *implicit* -- the author does not invoke them, and the translation does not require them. The existentialist and phenomenological frameworks (Heidegger's world-disclosure, Sartre's situation) cover this adequately.\n\n**2. Is the philosophy of language need mainly concentrated in K1策略?**\n\nYes. The K1策略 essay is the only place where language is treated as an explicit *object of analysis* rather than a medium of expression. Specifically:\n\n- The passage on language games (语言游戏) and how linguistic structure \"forces\" knowledge formation (本章节的目的，在于描述语言本身的结构，如何逼迫知识结构的形成) is directly Wittgensteinian territory.\n- The natural transformation framework for \"understanding a sentence\" (the 猫跳上了桌子 example, and the meme example 你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国) is a formalization of meaning-as-use that a Wittgenstein expert would engage with deeply.\n- The claim that \"structure and meaning are related by natural transformation\" (结构和意义之间的关系是自然变换) is a formal thesis about language that belongs to philosophy of language proper.\n\nAll of this is concentrated in K1策略 and can be handled alongside the category theory expert when that essay is addressed.\n\n**3. Is there anything in my field's overlap with philosophy of language that I cannot adequately cover?**\n\nWithin existentialism proper, no. The existentialist tradition's engagement with language (Heidegger's \"Language is the house of Being,\" Sartre's theory of prose in *What is Literature?*, Camus's literary philosophy) is something I can handle. The author's use of literary analogies (novels, games, rituals) to explain 梦境 and 诗意 maps onto existentialist aesthetics, not philosophy of language per se.\n\nThe one area where I defer is the *formal* claim in K1策略 that understanding (理解) can be described as a natural transformation between linguistic structure evolution and experiential evolution. This is a philosophy-of-language claim dressed in category-theoretic formalism, and I cannot evaluate whether it successfully captures what Wittgenstein, Davidson, or Brandom would recognize as a theory of understanding. But again, this is K1策略-specific.\n\n**Summary:** For the six non-category-theory essays, a philosophy of language expert is not needed. The existentialism, phenomenology, epistemology, and Chinese philosophy experts collectively cover the linguistic dimensions of those texts.
