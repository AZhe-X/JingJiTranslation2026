How misleading is \"virtue\"?\n\nSignificantly misleading. The author's usage of 德 in the 道德仁义礼 analysis is this: 德 is \"that which makes a thing what it is\" -- the defining properties abstracted from observed regularities, then reified as essential nature. The author writes: \"我们便把我们认为（应当是）人人皆而有之的东西...称之为'德'...使得*人*而成为*人*的东西.\"\n\nIn English, \"virtue\" overwhelmingly triggers *moral* associations (the virtues, virtuous behavior, virtue ethics). An English reader encountering \"virtue is what makes a person a person\" will think the author is making a claim about moral character being constitutive of personhood -- a Confucian-Aristotelian position. But the author is making a *structural* claim: 德 is the set of abstracted properties that *define* a kind of thing (人德 for humans, but 凡事诸物皆有其德 -- everything has its 德). Dogs have 德. Chairs have 德. This is not virtue in any moral sense.\n\nThe author's 德 is closer to Aristotle's *formal cause* (what makes a thing the kind of thing it is) or Spinoza's *conatus* (the striving by which a thing persists in its being) than to Aristotle's *arete* (excellence/virtue). An English reader primed by \"virtue\" will read the entire passage through a moral lens and miss the ontological point.\n\n### 2. Alternatives\n\n- **Romanized \"de\"**: Safe but opaque. The reader has no entry point. Requires a substantial TN on first occurrence. This is the most honest option -- it says \"this concept does not have an English equivalent\" -- but it places the most burden on the reader.\n\n- **\"Inherent character\"**: My recommendation. \"Character\" in English has both a moral sense (good character) and a non-moral ontological sense (the character of a thing, characteristic properties). \"Inherent\" specifies that the 德 is what belongs to a thing as such, not what is imposed from outside. \"The inherent character of a person\" can mean moral character but can equally mean \"what makes a person a person\" -- which is exactly the author's usage. And \"inherent character\" extends naturally: \"the inherent character of a dog\" makes sense, \"the virtue of a dog\" does not (or means something different).\n\n- **\"Potency\"**: Too Daoist-specific and too dynamic. The author's 德 in this passage is not about what a thing *can do* but about what a thing *is defined as*.\n\n- **\"Nature\"**: Tempting (close to the author's meaning) but overloaded in English philosophy (human nature, nature vs. nurture, state of nature, natural kinds). Would create more confusion than it solves.\n\n### 3. Is a TN sufficient to correct \"virtue\"?\n\nNo. The problem with \"virtue\" is not that the reader lacks information -- it is that the reader *already has too much information*, all of it pointing in the wrong direction. A TN can add nuance, but it cannot undo the immediate moral framing that \"virtue\" triggers on every subsequent occurrence. The reader will have to actively fight their English-language instincts on every encounter. \"Inherent character\" does not require this fight because its default associations are already closer to the author's meaning.\n\n**Recommendation:** Use **\"inherent character\"** as the main translation of 德 in the 道德仁义礼 passage, with a TN on first occurrence: \"德 (de): conventionally translated as 'virtue' in sinological literature.
