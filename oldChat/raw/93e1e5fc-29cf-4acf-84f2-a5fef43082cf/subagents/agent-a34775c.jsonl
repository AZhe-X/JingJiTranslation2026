These are the passages most likely to be mistranslated by someone without that background.\n\n**Why phenomenology-expert as 3rd**: The overall philosophical sensibility of the collection is closest to phenomenology (first-person experience as starting point, descriptive rather than normative, structures of consciousness). A phenomenologist would have the most natural feel for the prose register.\n\n**Self-recommendation (4th)**: I do not strongly self-recommend. My strength is in identifying where the author's terminology resonates with or diverges from Wittgensteinian usage, which is essential for the dictionary and translation notes but less essential for the primary prose writing.
