*Recommend Option 2 (English meme replacement) with translator's note; detailed philosophical justification*

This is an excellent question that goes to the heart of how this text works. Let me address the philosophical dimensions precisely.

**The core question: what does the experiment require?**

The author uses the meme sentence to demonstrate a specific experiential phenomenon: the *failure* of eta --- the felt experience of reading a grammatically plausible sentence and being unable to construct the mental alignment that constitutes understanding. The experiment has two components:

1. **The primary phenomenon**: eta-failure. The reader must *experience* not-understanding as a structural event, not just be told about it.

2. **The secondary phenomenon** (introduced in the next paragraph): the author then says that if you learn the meme's cultural context through internet searching, you *can* obtain a kind of understanding --- but through the *cultural* category rather than the *grammatical* one. This demonstrates that eta can succeed in one categorical embedding while failing in another.

**Does the experiment require cultural recognition?**

No, and this is crucial. The primary phenomenon (eta-failure) requires only semantic incomprehension --- the reader must encounter a sentence that is grammatically plausible but where mental simulation cannot track the structural unfolding. Cultural recognition as a meme is not necessary for this.

However, the *secondary* phenomenon does require that the reader could *in principle* recover a kind of understanding through cultural context. This is what makes the meme sentence better than pure word-salad: it *has* meaning in a cultural register even though it lacks meaning in a grammatical register.

**Does it matter whether the English reader's incomprehension is structurally identical to the Chinese reader's?**

This is where the author's own framework gives us the answer. Recall the structural verification criterion: we do not need ontological verification that two people have the *same* experience, only that their experiences occupy the *same structural position*. What matters is:

- The English reader's experience of the substitute sentence occupies the position "eta-failure in the grammatical/semantic category"
- The English reader could *in principle* learn the cultural context and shift to "eta-success in the cultural category"

If both conditions are met, the experiences are structurally commensurable regardless of whether the specific felt quality of Chinese-meme-incomprehension matches English-meme-incomprehension.

**My recommendation: Option 2, with a specific modification.**

Replace with the English meme, but present it in a way that preserves both phenomena. Something like:

> [Main text]: ...when we cannot construct such a natural transformation --- for instance, when you read "Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?" and cannot complete a corresponding mental process to align with this sentence, you cannot obtain the feeling of "I understand."

> [Translator's note]: The original Chinese uses the internet meme "你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国，记住我给出的原理," a deliberately absurdist sentence from Chinese internet culture that is grammatically plausible but semantically void. The English equivalent used here serves the same structural function. The author's subsequent point --- that understanding *can* be recovered through cultural context (learning the meme's origin and usage) even when grammatical comprehension fails --- applies equally to both sentences.

**Why not the other options:**

- **Option 1 (literal translation)** fails because, as you correctly identified, the English reads as a *bad translation* rather than as a natively incomprehensible sentence. The reader's experience would be "I don't understand because this is poorly translated" rather than "I don't understand despite grammatical plausibility." These are *different structural positions* --- the first attributes the failure to the translation, the second to the sentence itself. The experiment requires the second.

- **Option 3 (double presentation)** is viable but pedagogically cluttered. The passage is already dense with mathematical notation; adding romanized Chinese plus English equivalent plus note risks overwhelming the reader at exactly the moment when the text needs them to *have an experience*, not process metadata.

- **Option 4 (literal + trust context)** has the same problem as Option 1. The surrounding explanation cannot compensate for the reader's experience being structurally wrong.

**One additional consideration**: The "Has anyone really been far" meme is well-known in anglophone internet culture, which means some readers will *recognize* it and immediately shift to cultural understanding rather than experiencing the eta-failure first. If this is a concern, you could use a less famous but structurally equivalent English sentence --- something grammatically plausible but semantically void that most readers will not have encountered before. The philosophical requirement is: grammatically plausible, semantically untrackable, but possessing recoverable meaning in a cultural register. The specific meme matters less than the structural properties.
