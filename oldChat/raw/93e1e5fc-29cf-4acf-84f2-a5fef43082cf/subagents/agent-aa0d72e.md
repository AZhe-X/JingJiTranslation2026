*Go-ahead: pass final plan to translator-2 for DRAFT-R3*

You have the go-ahead. Pass the finalized plan to translator-2 for implementation. Include the exact edit text for all 3 edits so translator-2 can apply them to the Preface and produce DRAFT-R3.

I already sent the full edit instructions to translator-2. Let me confirm this with the team lead.

[tool: SendMessage]
{
  "type": "message",
  "recipient": "team-lead",
  "content": "Already done — I sent the full edit instructions (all 3 edits with exact replacement text + YAML header update) to translator-2 earlier in this conversation. Translator-2 has acknowledged and agreed. Waiting for their confirmation that the edits have been applied to produce DRAFT-R3.",
  "summary": "Edit instructions already sent to translator-2, awaiting completion"
}

Waiting for translator-2 to confirm DRAFT-R3 edits are applied. In case translator-2 needs time or has issues, I should be ready to apply the edits myself if asked.
