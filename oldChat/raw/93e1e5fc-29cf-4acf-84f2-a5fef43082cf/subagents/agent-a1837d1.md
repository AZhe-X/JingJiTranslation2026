*Two optional follow-ups: intersubjectivity via η, essays as philosophical experiments*

Two follow-up items from the author for you to consider. These are optional — only engage if you find them relevant to your field. If not, you can skip.

1. **Intersubjectivity (主体间性)**: If you have open questions about how intersubjectivity works in this framework, the author suggests looking at the natural transformation (自然变换) section in K1策略. The natural transformation η may be the mechanism through which intersubjective verification is possible — if two people share the same structural alignment (same η), their understanding is commensurable even without sharing qualia. Consider whether this resolves or reframes the intersubjectivity problem from your field's perspective.

2. **Philosophical Experiment (哲学实验)**: The author proposes "philosophical experiments" — constructing examples to awaken specific experiences in readers, then checking if those experiences are replicable. The author suggests that many parts of the essays THEMSELVES are philosophical experiments (not just descriptions of philosophy, but actual experiments being conducted on the reader). Re-read the essays with this lens: which specific passages function as philosophical experiments? Is the Sisyphus/cat essay itself an experiment in dissolving absurdity? Is the 道德仁义礼 reversal an experiment in restructuring the reader's 境?

If you have thoughts on either of these, please share. If not, no need to respond.

Sent my detailed response on both items. The key insights:

1. **Intersubjectivity**: The author's eta-based approach is structurally different from all traditional Chinese answers (Mencian assertion, Zhuangzi's provocative irresolution, Buddhist supernatural knowing, Neo-Confucian ontological commonality). It is closest to a functionalist reading of Xunzi's ritual theory -- structural compatibility rather than shared inner states.

2. **Philosophical experiments**: This is deeply resonant with how classical Chinese philosophy actually works (Mencius's child-at-the-well, Zhuangzi's parables). I identified specific essays as experiments -- the cat example in the Sisyphus essay, the 道德仁义礼 reversal, the coin-flip passage -- and flagged that the translator must preserve the experiential arc, not just propositional content, or risk destroying the experimental function.
