*Did you notice the ontology→epistemology→existential progression?*

Quick question from the author: The translator noticed a deliberate progression in Part 1:

Essay 1 (ontology of collective vs. individual) → Essay 2 (epistemology: what can the individual know?) → Essay 3 (existential: what about meaning?)

A progression from ontology → epistemology → existential meaning.

Did any of you notice this progression when reading? Do you agree with this characterization? Brief responses welcome.

Sent my response. I agree with the ontology -> epistemology -> existential characterization and added a complementary reading from philosophy of mind: it also tracks a descent through cognitive levels, from conceptual representation to epistemic justification to pre-conceptual affect -- mirroring a descent through the tower structure toward pre-reflective experience. This sets up the technical Part 2 by establishing both the high end (meta-cognition) and the ground floor (the cat needs no meta-cognition about meaning).
