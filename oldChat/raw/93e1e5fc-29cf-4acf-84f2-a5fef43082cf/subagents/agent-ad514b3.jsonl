Process at your judgment — make edits where you agree, push back where you disagree, flag anything for the author.\n\n**NOTE: Two items contradict our earlier 9-1 vote.** Chinese-phil (#1) and phil-mind (#4) want \"righteousness\" in the block quote. We voted that the 仁/义/礼 split applies ONLY to 德. \"Rightness\" throughout was our decision. Disregard these.\n\n**Also already fixed:** \"feeling of concern for the other\" was already changed to \"feeling directed toward the other\" per phenomenology review. Metaphysics and phil-mind flag the same issue — already done.\n\n---\n\n## METAPHYSICS EXPERT\n\n1. **元物理 optional TN** — author's own etymological rendering of \"metaphysics\" (元=meta, 物理=physics). Consider brief note if not covered elsewhere.\n2. Everything else confirmed accurate. Very positive review.\n\n## PHIL-MIND EXPERT\n\n1. ~~\"feeling of concern\"~~ — ALREADY FIXED\n2. **套用 → \"projected\" or \"imposed\"** instead of \"applied\" (line 42). 套用 means to mechanically impose a template — stronger than neutral \"apply.\" The author is describing epistemic overreach (first-person explanation imposed onto third-person observations).\n3. **发乎于心 consistency** — first occurrence (line 38) drops 心 (\"from within me\"), second (line 46) keeps it (\"from within the heart\"). Should be \"from within the heart\" in BOTH. 心 anchors the first-person interiority.\n4. ~~\"righteousness\" in block quote~~ — OVERRULED by earlier vote, phil-mind defers.\n\n## CHINESE-PHIL EXPERT\n\n1. ~~\"righteousness\" in block quote~~ — OVERRULED by earlier 9-1 vote.\n2. **Signal virtue→character shift in running text** (line 40), not just TN3. Suggestion: add \"what appeared as 'virtue' in the classical formulation\" after first \"character.\" Optional — TN3 does the work.\n3. **Footnote 3: \"what ought to be\" not \"what one ought to do\"** for 义/应当. 应当 is broader than action-specific.\n4. **\"general pattern\" → \"general law\" or \"universal regularity\"** for 规律 (line 44). 规律 carries normative force; \"pattern\" undersells it.\n\n## BUDDHISM EXPERT\n\n1. **Footnote 24: \"makes existence itself possible\" → \"enables existence to stand\"** or \"makes existence hold.\" Original says 使得存在得以成立 — sustaining-ground metaphor, not conditions-of-possibility (which adds Kantian overtone). Matches the canvas metaphor.\n2. Consider italicizing \"generated\" in early conventional-reading uses to signal it will be deconstructed. Minor.\n3. Everything else praised. Very positive.\n\n## WITTGENSTEIN EXPERT\n\n1. **套用 → \"projected\" or \"imposed\"** (line 42) — same as phil-mind. 套用 = template-applied, cookie-cuttered onto. \"Applied\" too neutral for the epistemic overreach.\n2. **Remove parentheses around (can)/(should)/(ought to be)** (lines 40, 44). Use italics instead: *can*, *should*, *ought to be*. Parentheses diminish the contrastive force; the Chinese uses bold for this contrast.\n3. **Footnote 24: \"paper\" not \"canvas\"** for 画纸. 画纸 is humbler — 道 as unassuming substrate.\n4. **Optional TN on 失 echo** — connects Laozi's 失 to the author's 已经全部失去了 at the end.\n5. **TN3: add that 德 applies to ALL things** (凡事诸物皆有其德), not just persons — this universality separates author's usage from Confucian moral virtue.\n\n---\n\n**CONSENSUS ACROSS MULTIPLE EXPERTS:**\n- 套用 → \"projected\"/\"imposed\" (phil-mind + wittgenstein)\n- 发乎于心 → \"from within the heart\" consistently (phil-mind)\n- Footnote 24 wording needs adjustment (buddhism + wittgenstein)\n- Footnote 3: \"what ought to be\" (chinese-phil)\n- 规律 → stronger word (chinese-phil)\n- Parentheses → italics for (can)/(should) (wittgenstein)\n\nUse your best judgment.

Finally, character is a general regularity, because all things have their character (the pattern we take them to follow, that which makes a thing what it is), and so we gather all instances of character together, inductively abstract from them, and arrive at \"the Way.\" The Way, then, is in fact generated from character — yet we understand it as the Way generating character.\n    45→\n    46→Thus the entire logical order is reversed.

This is the mechanism by which phenomena are transformed into the metaphysical — the bottom-up construction is concealed, and the result appears to be top-down.\n","numLines":71,"startLine":1,"totalLines":71}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"cb25e684-435f-4b68-8b52-69c4f717a96c"}

Now let me verify the original Chinese for the key items before making changes. Let me check the 套用 context and 发乎于心 occurrences.\n\nThe original at line 26 has: \"仅仅是将我对'**自己**的'*现象礼*'\"的解释**套用**到了我们看到的**别人**所行的'*现象礼*'上\"\n\nAnd 发乎于心 at line 24: \"既是我对人时发乎于心的对他人感受\" (first occurrence)\nAnd at line 28: \"最初的（解释上）发乎于心的而有的现象礼\" (second occurrence)\n\nNow let me check the first occurrence in the draft. Line 38: \"it is the feeling that arises from the heart when I am with another person.\" This does have \"from the heart.\" Let me check more carefully -- phil-mind says the first occurrence \"drops 心.\"\n\nLooking at line 38 again: \"it is the feeling that arises from the heart when I am with another person — a feeling directed toward the other.\"\n\nThat says \"from the heart.\" Now line 42: \"the feeling that arises from the heart and the driving force are only what **I** feel.\"\n\nBoth already say \"from the heart.\" Let me check if there's a third occurrence or if the phil-mind expert was looking at an earlier version. The draft appears consistent -- \"from the heart\" appears in both lines 38 and 42, and \"from within the heart\" in line 46.\n\nActually, the inconsistency might be \"from the heart\" (lines 38, 42) vs \"from within the heart\" (line 46). The original is 发乎于心 which literally is \"arises/issues from within the heart\" -- the 于 gives the \"within\" sense. Let me standardize to \"from within the heart\" everywhere.\n\nNow let me process all the changes. Here's my assessment of each item:\n\n**1. 套用 → \"imposed\" (phil-mind + wittgenstein consensus):** ADOPT. 套用 means to mechanically apply a template/formula onto something -- \"applied\" is too neutral. Between \"projected\" and \"imposed,\" I prefer \"imposed\" -- it captures the template-forcing quality of 套用 (套 = to fit over, like putting on a sleeve/套子). \"Projected\" has psychoanalytic overtones not in the original.\n\n**2. 发乎于心 consistency → \"from within the heart\" everywhere:** ADOPT. Standardize lines 38 and 42 to match line 46.\n\n**3. Footnote 24 wording (buddhism + wittgenstein):** ADOPT the buddhism suggestion. Original: 使得存在得以成立 = \"enables/allows existence to come into being/stand.\" \"Makes existence itself possible\" adds Kantian conditions-of-possibility framing not in the Chinese. \"That which enables existence to stand\" is closer. On canvas vs paper (wittgenstein): ADOPT \"paper\" -- 画纸 is literally painting-paper, and the humbler material matches the author's intent.\n\n**4. Parentheses → italics for (can)/(should)/(ought to) (wittgenstein):** ADOPT partially. The original Chinese uses bold (** **) for these contrasts: **可以**, **应该**. The parenthetical format in English does diminish the force. However, the author's Chinese also uses parentheses around （可以） and （应该） in line 26.

The Way generates all things; the Way is the most \"primordial\" *meta-physics* (元物理), and everything that follows from it is *generated*. Thus the Way is the highest — it is the metaphysical — while ritual conduct is the lowest — it is the phenomenal.[^TN2]\n\nHowever, ritual conduct is in fact derived from phenomena. Let us call the **actual** behavior in phenomena \"phenomenal ritual conduct.\" I have an **explanation** for phenomenal ritual conduct: it is the feeling that arises from the heart when I am with another person — a feeling directed toward the other. This feeling is something I **actually** feel, and is therefore part of phenomena; I call it \"phenomenal humaneness.\" This feeling moves me to want to treat the other person in such-and-such a way; this driving force (*motivation*) is also something I **actually** feel, and so I call it \"phenomenal rightness.\"[^3] Phenomenal ritual conduct exists not only in how I treat others, but also in how other people treat one another. We therefore extend phenomenal humaneness and phenomenal rightness as our **explanation** of phenomenal ritual conduct more broadly. That is to say: because phenomenal ritual conduct (apparently) is exhibited in everyone around us, and because we interpret phenomenal ritual conduct as \"phenomenal humaneness generates phenomenal rightness, which in turn generates phenomenal ritual conduct,\" we conclude that everyone who practices phenomenal ritual conduct (ought to) possess this phenomenal humaneness.[^4]\n\nNext, we take what we believe (ought to be) universally possessed — here, phenomenal humaneness — and call it \"character\" (德).[^TN3] And why should there be such a universal regularity? Because of \"the Way.\"[^24]\n\nWe can now see that, at the level of phenomena, humaneness and rightness are merely an *explanation* of ritual conduct. As for what we observe of external phenomena, in fact we have only seen the phenomenal ritual conduct within phenomena, and from it we **infer** phenomenal rightness, and from phenomenal rightness we **infer** phenomenal humaneness — even though **no** actual phenomenal rightness or phenomenal humaneness appears in *my* phenomena, because the feeling that arises from the heart and the driving force are only what **I** feel when **I** practice phenomenal ritual conduct. I cannot truly feel **another person's** inner feelings; I have merely **applied** my explanation of \"**my own** phenomenal ritual conduct\" to the phenomenal ritual conduct we observe **others** performing. Therefore, the humaneness and rightness in other people are in fact *generated from* the phenomenal ritual conduct in phenomena. But in our interpretation, we take it to be the reverse: humaneness generates rightness, and from rightness one practices ritual conduct — as though phenomenal ritual conduct were generated *by* humaneness and rightness.\n\nNext, on the basis of this generated humaneness and rightness, we conclude: \"all people possess humaneness.\" But in fact it is: \"all people (**can**) possess humaneness,\" since we discovered from many people who exhibit humaneness that many people have it — humaneness is thus an inductively derived **property**. Yet our final understanding becomes: \"all people (**should**) possess humaneness\" — or rather, \"only those who possess humaneness count as human.\" And so a **property** that a person can have — here, humaneness — is transformed into a **definition** of personhood. These definitions, taken together, define **what a person is** — that is, \"character\": that which makes a person a person.[^TN4] We thus see that character, too, is in fact generated from humaneness — yet in our understanding we take it to be the reverse: *because* you are a person, *therefore* you must possess humaneness. Finally, character is a general regularity, because all things have their character (the pattern we take them to follow, that which makes a thing what it is), and so we gather all instances of character together, inductively abstract from them, and arrive at \"the Way.\" The Way, then, is in fact generated from character — yet we understand it as the Way generating character.\n\nThus the entire logical order is reversed. The Way generates character; the character of a person is humaneness; from humaneness arises rightness; from rightness one practices ritual conduct. But this final \"ritual conduct\" is no longer the original phenomenal ritual conduct, because the logic by which phenomenal ritual conduct generated \"the Way\" has been **buried from view** — it has been entirely **lost**. People take the Way to be the most primordial *meta-physics*. And so the ritual conduct that is finally generated is now merely a norm, and not necessarily the original phenomenal ritual conduct that (in the explanation) arose from within the heart.\n\nIn practice, this loss continues cascading downward, level after level — pursuing the branches and forgetting the root. The above is not an interpretation of the *Laozi*; rather, in this passage there happens to appear precisely this kind of staircase running from the metaphysical down to the phenomenal, and so I use it here as an example.\n\n---\n\n## Footnotes\n\n[^3]: Humaneness, rightness, and ritual conduct are in fact already a metaphysical framework. And yet we cannot help but rely on some framework to describe phenomena; thus even though I have tried my utmost to restore their original phenomenal character, the account remains imprecise. In Chinese philosophy, humaneness and rightness are often mentioned together. Humaneness (仁) is said to be *loving others*; rightness (义) is said to be *what ought to be*. In the conventional understanding — to take loving one's father as an example of humaneness — what I *ought to do* out of love for my father is rightness. And the concrete behavior that fulfills this rightness is ritual conduct. Rightness is thus the thing that connects humaneness to concrete action (ritual conduct). At the phenomenal level, I use \"phenomenal humaneness\" to describe the inner feeling (of love) I have toward my father — a feeling that impels me to act in certain ways. This driving force, this \"motivation\" itself, is what connects my feeling (phenomenal humaneness) to my behavior (phenomenal ritual conduct), and so it is fitting to call it phenomenal rightness.\n\n[^4]: The phenomenal humaneness and phenomenal rightness thus extended to others are no longer within *my* phenomena.\n\n[^24]: A note of caution: the interpretation of \"the Way\" (道) more faithful to Daoist thought would be closer to *that which makes existence itself possible* — pictorially, something like the canvas on which a painting is made. Here, we are merely expressing in structural terms that \"the Way\" can be understood to determine and generate \"character.\"\n\n---\n\n## Translator's Notes\n\n[^TN1]: Translation adapted from Ivanhoe (2003). Key terms follow this volume's glossary. Cf. Ivanhoe: \"When the Way was lost there was Virtue; When Virtue was lost there was benevolence; When benevolence was lost there was righteousness; When righteousness was lost there were the rites.\" We render 仁 as \"humaneness\" (following Ames & Rosemont) rather than \"benevolence,\" 义 as \"rightness\" rather than \"righteousness\" to capture the author's usage as motivational disposition rather than moral judgment, and 礼 as \"ritual conduct\" to emphasize the behavioral dimension.\n\n[^TN2]: The author interprets 形 (xing, \"form\") in the classical term 形而上 as equivalent to 现象 (phenomena). In the *Xici zhuan* (Commentary on the Appended Phrases, *Yijing*), 形 conventionally means \"visible form\" or \"physical shape.\" The author's reinterpretation — phenomena as the ground, the metaphysical as what is built upon it — is a significant philosophical departure. The author's own preceding paragraph (on 元物理 and the directionality of 上) already explains this reinterpretation to the reader; this note is supplementary. See the Translator's Introduction for further discussion.\n\n[^TN3]: The author now reconceives 德 (de) not as virtue in the moral sense but as (constitutive) character — the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. Hereafter shortened to \"character.\" This constructivist reading departs from both the standard Confucian sense of 德 as moral virtue and the Daoist sense of 德 as natural potency.\n\n[^TN4]: Note the crucial reversal: a *property* that people happen to have (observed inductively) becomes a *definition* of what people are (imposed normatively). This is the mechanism by which phenomena are transformed into the metaphysical — the bottom-up construction is concealed, and the result appears to be top-down.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":39,"oldLines":7,"newStart":39,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," Next, we take what we believe (ought to be) universally possessed — here, phenomenal humaneness — and call it \"character\" (德).[^TN3] And why should there be such a universal regularity?

Key terms follow this volume's glossary. Cf. Ivanhoe: \"When the Way was lost there was Virtue; When Virtue was lost there was benevolence; When benevolence was lost there was righteousness; When righteousness was lost there were the rites.\" We render 仁 as \"humaneness\" (following Ames & Rosemont) rather than \"benevolence,\" 义 as \"rightness\" rather than \"righteousness\" to capture the author's usage as motivational disposition rather than moral judgment, and 礼 as \"ritual conduct\" to emphasize the behavioral dimension.\n\n[^TN2]: The author interprets 形 (xing, \"form\") in the classical term 形而上 as equivalent to 现象 (phenomena). In the *Xici zhuan* (Commentary on the Appended Phrases, *Yijing*), 形 conventionally means \"visible form\" or \"physical shape.\" The author's reinterpretation — phenomena as the ground, the metaphysical as what is built upon it — is a significant philosophical departure. The author's own preceding paragraph (on 元物理 and the directionality of 上) already explains this reinterpretation to the reader; this note is supplementary. See the Translator's Introduction for further discussion.\n\n[^TN3]: The author now reconceives 德 (de) not as virtue in the moral sense but as (constitutive) character — the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. Hereafter shortened to \"character.\" This constructivist reading departs from both the standard Confucian sense of 德 as moral virtue and the Daoist sense of 德 as natural potency.\n\n[^TN4]: Note the crucial reversal: a *property* that people happen to have (observed inductively) becomes a *definition* of what people are (imposed normatively). This is the mechanism by which phenomena are transformed into the metaphysical — the bottom-up construction is concealed, and the result appears to be top-down.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":35,"oldLines":7,"newStart":35,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," Here, the Way, virtue, humaneness, rightness, and ritual conduct run from first to last as from top to bottom.

The Way generates all things; the Way is the most \"primordial\" *meta-physics* (元物理), and everything that follows from it is *generated*. Thus the Way is the highest — it is the metaphysical — while ritual conduct is the lowest — it is the phenomenal.[^TN2]\n\nHowever, ritual conduct is in fact derived from phenomena. Let us call the **actual** behavior in phenomena \"phenomenal ritual conduct.\" I have an **explanation** for phenomenal ritual conduct: it is the feeling that arises from within the heart when I am with another person — a feeling directed toward the other. This feeling is something I **actually** feel, and is therefore part of phenomena; I call it \"phenomenal humaneness.\" This feeling moves me to want to treat the other person in such-and-such a way; this driving force (*motivation*) is also something I **actually** feel, and so I call it \"phenomenal rightness.\"[^3] Phenomenal ritual conduct exists not only in how I treat others, but also in how other people treat one another. We therefore extend phenomenal humaneness and phenomenal rightness as our **explanation** of phenomenal ritual conduct more broadly. That is to say: because phenomenal ritual conduct (apparently) is exhibited in everyone around us, and because we interpret phenomenal ritual conduct as \"phenomenal humaneness generates phenomenal rightness, which in turn generates phenomenal ritual conduct,\" we conclude that everyone who practices phenomenal ritual conduct (ought to) possess this phenomenal humaneness.[^4]\n\nNext, we take what we believe (ought to be) universally possessed — here, phenomenal humaneness — and call it \"character\" (德).[^TN3] And why should there be such a universal regularity? Because of \"the Way.\"[^24]\n\nWe can now see that, at the level of phenomena, humaneness and rightness are merely an *explanation* of ritual conduct. As for what we observe of external phenomena, in fact we have only seen the phenomenal ritual conduct within phenomena, and from it we **infer** phenomenal rightness, and from phenomenal rightness we **infer** phenomenal humaneness — even though **no** actual phenomenal rightness or phenomenal humaneness appears in *my* phenomena, because the feeling that arises from the heart and the driving force are only what **I** feel when **I** practice phenomenal ritual conduct. I cannot truly feel **another person's** inner feelings; I have merely **imposed** my explanation of \"**my own** phenomenal ritual conduct\" onto the phenomenal ritual conduct we observe **others** performing. Therefore, the humaneness and rightness in other people are in fact *generated from* the phenomenal ritual conduct in phenomena. But in our interpretation, we take it to be the reverse: humaneness generates rightness, and from rightness one practices ritual conduct — as though phenomenal ritual conduct were generated *by* humaneness and rightness.\n\nNext, on the basis of this generated humaneness and rightness, we conclude: \"all people possess humaneness.\" But in fact it is: \"all people (**can**) possess humaneness,\" since we discovered from many people who exhibit humaneness that many people have it — humaneness is thus an inductively derived **property**. Yet our final understanding becomes: \"all people (**should**) possess humaneness\" — or rather, \"only those who possess humaneness count as human.\" And so a **property** that a person can have — here, humaneness — is transformed into a **definition** of personhood. These definitions, taken together, define **what a person is** — that is, \"character\": that which makes a person a person.[^TN4] We thus see that character, too, is in fact generated from humaneness — yet in our understanding we take it to be the reverse: *because* you are a person, *therefore* you must possess humaneness. Finally, character is a general regularity, because all things have their character (the pattern we take them to follow, that which makes a thing what it is), and so we gather all instances of character together, inductively abstract from them, and arrive at \"the Way.\" The Way, then, is in fact generated from character — yet we understand it as the Way generating character.\n\nThus the entire logical order is reversed. The Way generates character; the character of a person is humaneness; from humaneness arises rightness; from rightness one practices ritual conduct. But this final \"ritual conduct\" is no longer the original phenomenal ritual conduct, because the logic by which phenomenal ritual conduct generated \"the Way\" has been **buried from view** — it has been entirely **lost**. People take the Way to be the most primordial *meta-physics*. And so the ritual conduct that is finally generated is now merely a norm, and not necessarily the original phenomenal ritual conduct that (in the explanation) arose from within the heart.\n\nIn practice, this loss continues cascading downward, level after level — pursuing the branches and forgetting the root. The above is not an interpretation of the *Laozi*; rather, in this passage there happens to appear precisely this kind of staircase running from the metaphysical down to the phenomenal, and so I use it here as an example.\n\n---\n\n## Footnotes\n\n[^3]: Humaneness, rightness, and ritual conduct are in fact already a metaphysical framework. And yet we cannot help but rely on some framework to describe phenomena; thus even though I have tried my utmost to restore their original phenomenal character, the account remains imprecise. In Chinese philosophy, humaneness and rightness are often mentioned together. Humaneness (仁) is said to be *loving others*; rightness (义) is said to be *what ought to be*. In the conventional understanding — to take loving one's father as an example of humaneness — what I *ought to do* out of love for my father is rightness. And the concrete behavior that fulfills this rightness is ritual conduct. Rightness is thus the thing that connects humaneness to concrete action (ritual conduct). At the phenomenal level, I use \"phenomenal humaneness\" to describe the inner feeling (of love) I have toward my father — a feeling that impels me to act in certain ways. This driving force, this \"motivation\" itself, is what connects my feeling (phenomenal humaneness) to my behavior (phenomenal ritual conduct), and so it is fitting to call it phenomenal rightness.\n\n[^4]: The phenomenal humaneness and phenomenal rightness thus extended to others are no longer within *my* phenomena.\n\n[^24]: A note of caution: the interpretation of \"the Way\" (道) more faithful to Daoist thought would be closer to *that which makes existence itself possible* — pictorially, something like the canvas on which a painting is made. Here, we are merely expressing in structural terms that \"the Way\" can be understood to determine and generate \"character.\"\n\n---\n\n## Translator's Notes\n\n[^TN1]: Translation adapted from Ivanhoe (2003).

The Way generates all things; the Way is the most \"primordial\" *meta-physics* (元物理), and everything that follows from it is *generated*. Thus the Way is the highest — it is the metaphysical — while ritual conduct is the lowest — it is the phenomenal.[^TN2]\n\nHowever, ritual conduct is in fact derived from phenomena. Let us call the **actual** behavior in phenomena \"phenomenal ritual conduct.\" I have an **explanation** for phenomenal ritual conduct: it is the feeling that arises from within the heart when I am with another person — a feeling directed toward the other. This feeling is something I **actually** feel, and is therefore part of phenomena; I call it \"phenomenal humaneness.\" This feeling moves me to want to treat the other person in such-and-such a way; this driving force (*motivation*) is also something I **actually** feel, and so I call it \"phenomenal rightness.\"[^3] Phenomenal ritual conduct exists not only in how I treat others, but also in how other people treat one another. We therefore extend phenomenal humaneness and phenomenal rightness as our **explanation** of phenomenal ritual conduct more broadly. That is to say: because phenomenal ritual conduct (apparently) is exhibited in everyone around us, and because we interpret phenomenal ritual conduct as \"phenomenal humaneness generates phenomenal rightness, which in turn generates phenomenal ritual conduct,\" we conclude that everyone who practices phenomenal ritual conduct (ought to) possess this phenomenal humaneness.[^4]\n\nNext, we take what we believe (ought to be) universally possessed — here, phenomenal humaneness — and call it \"character\" (德).[^TN3] And why should there be such a universal regularity? Because of \"the Way.\"[^24]\n\nWe can now see that, at the level of phenomena, humaneness and rightness are merely an *explanation* of ritual conduct. As for what we observe of external phenomena, in fact we have only seen the phenomenal ritual conduct within phenomena, and from it we **infer** phenomenal rightness, and from phenomenal rightness we **infer** phenomenal humaneness — even though **no** actual phenomenal rightness or phenomenal humaneness appears in *my* phenomena, because the feeling that arises from within the heart and the driving force are only what **I** feel when **I** practice phenomenal ritual conduct. I cannot truly feel **another person's** inner feelings; I have merely **imposed** my explanation of \"**my own** phenomenal ritual conduct\" onto the phenomenal ritual conduct we observe **others** performing. Therefore, the humaneness and rightness in other people are in fact *generated from* the phenomenal ritual conduct in phenomena. But in our interpretation, we take it to be the reverse: humaneness generates rightness, and from rightness one practices ritual conduct — as though phenomenal ritual conduct were generated *by* humaneness and rightness.\n\nNext, on the basis of this generated humaneness and rightness, we conclude: \"all people possess humaneness.\" But in fact it is: \"all people (**can**) possess humaneness,\" since we discovered from many people who exhibit humaneness that many people have it — humaneness is thus an inductively derived **property**. Yet our final understanding becomes: \"all people (**should**) possess humaneness\" — or rather, \"only those who possess humaneness count as human.\" And so a **property** that a person can have — here, humaneness — is transformed into a **definition** of personhood. These definitions, taken together, define **what a person is** — that is, \"character\": that which makes a person a person.[^TN4] We thus see that character, too, is in fact generated from humaneness — yet in our understanding we take it to be the reverse: *because* you are a person, *therefore* you must possess humaneness. Finally, character is a general regularity, because all things have their character (the pattern we take them to follow, that which makes a thing what it is), and so we gather all instances of character together, inductively abstract from them, and arrive at \"the Way.\" The Way, then, is in fact generated from character — yet we understand it as the Way generating character.\n\nThus the entire logical order is reversed. The Way generates character; the character of a person is humaneness; from humaneness arises rightness; from rightness one practices ritual conduct. But this final \"ritual conduct\" is no longer the original phenomenal ritual conduct, because the logic by which phenomenal ritual conduct generated \"the Way\" has been **buried from view** — it has been entirely **lost**. People take the Way to be the most primordial *meta-physics*. And so the ritual conduct that is finally generated is now merely a norm, and not necessarily the original phenomenal ritual conduct that (in the explanation) arose from within the heart.\n\nIn practice, this loss continues cascading downward, level after level — pursuing the branches and forgetting the root. The above is not an interpretation of the *Laozi*; rather, in this passage there happens to appear precisely this kind of staircase running from the metaphysical down to the phenomenal, and so I use it here as an example.\n\n---\n\n## Footnotes\n\n[^3]: Humaneness, rightness, and ritual conduct are in fact already a metaphysical framework. And yet we cannot help but rely on some framework to describe phenomena; thus even though I have tried my utmost to restore their original phenomenal character, the account remains imprecise. In Chinese philosophy, humaneness and rightness are often mentioned together. Humaneness (仁) is said to be *loving others*; rightness (义) is said to be *what ought to be*. In the conventional understanding — to take loving one's father as an example of humaneness — what I *ought to do* out of love for my father is rightness. And the concrete behavior that fulfills this rightness is ritual conduct. Rightness is thus the thing that connects humaneness to concrete action (ritual conduct). At the phenomenal level, I use \"phenomenal humaneness\" to describe the inner feeling (of love) I have toward my father — a feeling that impels me to act in certain ways. This driving force, this \"motivation\" itself, is what connects my feeling (phenomenal humaneness) to my behavior (phenomenal ritual conduct), and so it is fitting to call it phenomenal rightness.\n\n[^4]: The phenomenal humaneness and phenomenal rightness thus extended to others are no longer within *my* phenomena.\n\n[^24]: A note of caution: the interpretation of \"the Way\" (道) more faithful to Daoist thought would be closer to *that which makes existence itself possible* — pictorially, something like the canvas on which a painting is made.

I cannot truly feel **another person's** inner feelings; I have merely **imposed** my explanation of \"**my own** phenomenal ritual conduct\" onto the phenomenal ritual conduct we observe **others** performing. Therefore, the humaneness and rightness in other people are in fact *generated from* the phenomenal ritual conduct in phenomena.

Yet our final understanding becomes: \"all people (**should**) possess humaneness\" — or rather, \"only those who possess humaneness count as human.\" And so a **property** that a person can have — here, humaneness — is transformed into a **definition** of personhood.

Finally, character is a general regularity, because all things have their character (the pattern we take them to follow, that which makes a thing what it is), and so we gather all instances of character together, inductively abstract from them, and arrive at \"the Way.\" The Way, then, is in fact generated from character — yet we understand it as the Way generating character.\n    45→\n    46→Thus the entire logical order is reversed.

Original 所谓义，是谓应当 is just \"ought\" without action-specificity. The applied example (\"what I *ought to do* out of love\") correctly retains \"do\" since the original has 应当做的.\n\n2. **Lines 40, 44: 规律 → \"regularity\"** — \"general pattern\" → \"general regularity\" in both occurrences. 规律 carries normative force beyond mere \"pattern.\"\n\n### From Phil-Mind + Wittgenstein (consensus):\n3. **Line 42: 套用 → \"imposed...onto\"** — \"applied my explanation...to\" → \"imposed my explanation...onto\". 套用 means to mechanically force-fit a template (套 = sleeve/sheath).
