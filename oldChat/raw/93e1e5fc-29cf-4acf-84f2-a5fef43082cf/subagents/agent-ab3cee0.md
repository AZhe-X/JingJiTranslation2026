*Is *

The author asks: would translating 德 as "virtue" risk large misleading interpretations for readers of 境集?

Context: Chinese-phil-expert recommends "virtue" as the default (it's the mainstream sinological standard), with "potency" in specifically Daoist passages, and a glossary/TN explaining the wider senses (moral virtue → natural potency → inherent character).

But the author's usage is constructivist — 德 in 境集 is not purely Confucian moral virtue nor purely Daoist natural potency. The worry: does "virtue" carry so much moral baggage in English that it would actively mislead readers about what the author means?

Please assess:
1. How misleading is "virtue" for 德 in this author's specific philosophical context?
2. Would an alternative (e.g., "de" romanized, "character," "potency") be less misleading, or would it create other problems?
3. Is the TN/glossary sufficient to correct any misleading impression, or is the word itself too loaded?

Give your honest assessment — the author wants to know if "virtue" is safe or dangerous here.

This is a crucial question. Let me think carefully about the specific risk in this author's context before responding.

I've sent a revised, more honest assessment to the team lead. The key shift in my thinking:

**I now recommend romanized "de" over "virtue" for 境集 specifically.** The decisive argument is the asymmetry between how glossaries work for unfamiliar vs. familiar terms:

- **Unfamiliar term ("de")**: Reader checks glossary, learns the concept on the author's terms. The glossary *defines*.
- **Familiar term ("virtue")**: Reader thinks they already know what it means, skips the glossary. The misleading moral connotation reasserts itself on every encounter. The glossary *corrects* -- but only if consulted, and it won't be.

"Virtue" is the right default for mainstream sinological translation. But for a constructivist text that deliberately departs from both Confucian and Daoist mainstream usage, it imports more confusion than it resolves. The opacity of "de" is a feature: it forces engagement with the author's actual meaning rather than an English approximation that is actually a misapproximation.
