*All 6 flags reviewed — 4 already applied, 2 minor kept as-is, no changes needed*

I've reviewed all 6 editorial flags against the current draft of Essay4-DaoDeRenYiLi.md. Here's my assessment:

**Priority flags 1-3: Already addressed in the current draft.**
- Flag 1 (line 38 em dashes): Already applied — "— apparently —" and "— ought to —" are in place.
- Flag 2 (line 42 sentence split): Already applied — period after "appears in *my* phenomena." creates the split.
- Flag 3 (line 44 bold+italic): Already applied — "**what a *person* is**" has correct formatting.

**Minor flag 4: Already addressed.**
- Line 36 already reads "proceed from first to last, that is, from top to bottom."

**Minor flags 5-6: Reviewed, keeping as-is (translator's judgment).**

- Flag 5 ("it is the phenomenal" landing flatly): I'm keeping this. The parallel structure "it is the metaphysical" / "it is the phenomenal" creates deliberate symmetry. The editor's suggestion to add "the form itself" would break that symmetry and add content not in the source ("是为形" is just "it is the form/phenomena" — no elaboration). The slight flatness is acceptable because the passage is building toward the reversal, not arriving at it.

- Flag 6 (footnote 3 "is said to be" vs. "means"): Keeping "is said to be." In a footnote where the author is reporting conventional definitions that the main text is about to deconstruct, the distancing "is said to be" is philosophically more accurate than the assertive "means." The author is not endorsing these definitions — they're the metaphysical framework the essay is exposing as constructed.

**Note:** I was unable to update the YAML header (file edit was denied). The draft content is correct as-is — all actionable flags were already addressed in the current version. The YAML should be updated to DRAFT-R2 when possible.

**Summary:** No content changes needed. The draft is ready for final polish.

Good. The translator has reviewed all 6 flags and confirmed they're either already addressed or deliberately kept as-is with sound reasoning. The justifications for flags 5 and 6 are solid — the parallel structure argument and the distancing "is said to be" both make philosophical sense.

Let me update the YAML header and mark the task complete.

File edits are being denied. This may be a permission setting for draft files. Let me mark the task complete and note the YAML update is pending.

Task #29 is complete. Task #30 (Essay 3 draft) was blocked by #29, so it should now be unblocked. Let me confirm and notify translator-2 to proceed.

  "taskId": "30"

Task #30 has already moved to in_progress — translator-2 appears to have started on it. Good.

[tool: SendMessage]
{
  "type": "message",
  "recipient": "translator-2",
  "content": "Task #29 confirmed complete. Your reasoning on flags 5 and 6 is sound — the parallel structure and the distancing \"is said to be\" are both well-justified. The YAML header update to DRAFT-R2 is pending (file edits are currently restricted); I'll update it when permissions allow.\n\nI see Task #30 (Essay 3) is now in progress. A few reminders for this draft:\n\n1. The experiential arc is the #1 priority: Sisyphus (mythic/dramatic) -> office worker (modern/relatable) -> cat owner (intimate/mundane). The de-escalation in dramatic register IS the philosophical argument. Each step must feel less grand than the last.\n\n2. The interrupted thought at the end of the office worker section (\"而上述例子中的人则还尚未——\") followed by \"但是等一等\"
