On re-reading the full protocol, I see that the naming approach is actually consistent across probes -- Essay 2 names \"three scenarios involving Bob,\" Essay 5 names \"two kinds of dreamscapes,\" Appendix names \"coin-flipping.\" The Essay 7 no-naming principle is the exception (because recall is diagnostic), not the rule. I withdraw my objection.\n\nThe protocol is well-constructed. The five-stage temporal architecture, the marginal-notes-first step, the Q4 softening, the expanded Critical Experiential Checks, and the internal analysis notes all serve the goal of maximally uncontaminated experiential data. Ready for implementation when we have finished drafts.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"287c162a-3e84-49bf-888b-2611752ff909","timestamp":"2026-02-11T09:22:52.483Z"}
