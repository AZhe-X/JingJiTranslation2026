*FINAL Reporting Protocol compiled and written — summary of all changes*

## FINAL Reporting Protocol — Compiled and Written

The revised Reporting Protocol has been written to `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Standby Reader/Reporting-Protocol.md`. All 11 votes were APPROVE (with amendments incorporated). Here is a summary of what changed and what was kept.

---

### Changes from the original protocol

**After the Preface (5 questions, was 3):**
- Original 3 questions kept
- ADDED: "Based on the preface alone, what kind of reading experience are you expecting?" (baseline expectation — editor proposal)
- ADDED: "Is there anything from the Preface that you're now anticipating or looking for in the essays?" (anticipation-detection / spoiler test — epistemology-expert proposal)

**After Each Essay (now 3 steps, was a flat list of 5 questions):**
- Step 1: Request marginal notes before questions ("If you made any marks or notes while reading, please share them now — even brief ones.") — editor proposal, buddhism-expert revised framing
- Step 2: 7 general questions (was 5):
  - Q1-Q3 unchanged
  - Q4 REWORDED: "How would you describe what this essay was asking you to do — follow an argument? Notice something? Something else?" (replaces the priming "experience vs. argument" wording — epistemology-expert proposal. This resolves the deferral question: softened wording can be asked after every essay, including Part 1)
  - Q5 ADDED: "Did anything in this essay remind you of something from your own life or experience?" (chinese-phil-expert proposal)
  - Q6-Q7 SPLIT from original Q5: "Did you want to keep reading after this essay?" + "Were there any passages where your attention flagged or you had to push through?" (editor proposal)
- Step 3: Apparatus questions for specific essays only:
  - Essay 4: "Did the translator's notes help or interrupt your reading?" (metaphysics-expert proposal)
  - Essays 6-7: "Were there passages where the notation felt like a barrier? If so, did the examples nearby help you through?" (chinese-phil-expert + metaphysics-expert independent convergence)

**After Full Collection (5 questions, was 4; word count replaces page count):**
- Q1 unchanged
- Q2 REWORDED: "stayed with you most / didn't fully land" replaces "worked best and worst" (editor proposal)
- Q3-Q4 unchanged
- Q5 ADDED: Preface retrospective ("Now that you've read everything, did the Preface prepare you well?...") — chinese-phil-expert + metaphysics-expert convergence
- "300-600 words" replaces "1-2 pages" (metaphysics-expert proposal)

**Final Prompts: Unchanged.** All three prompts kept as-is.

**Critical Experiential Checks (8 probes, was 3):**
- Essay 1 ADDED: Physics comparison — editor + metaphysics + epistemology convergence
- Essay 2 ADDED: Three Bob scenarios — epistemology-expert proposal
- Essay 3 unchanged
- Essay 4 unchanged
- Essay 5 ADDED: Two kinds of dreamscapes — chinese-phil + metaphysics + epistemology convergence (chinese-phil-expert wording selected)
- Essay 6 ADDED: Magic books + Ship of Theseus — editor + metaphysics + epistemology convergence
- Essay 7 REFINED: "what was the difference in your experience of reading them?" (epistemology-expert refinement)
- Appendix ADDED: Coin-flipping + everyday activities — editor proposal
- Non-leading principle reinforced with specific instruction not to name the Essay 7 sentences (wittgenstein-expert principle)

**New section: Optional Re-read Test (Essay 3):**
- "If you re-read just the final example in Essay 3, does it produce the same experience as it did the first time?" — epistemology-expert proposal. Marked as optional/experimental.

**New section: Internal Analysis Notes:**
- 4 notes for the team: Essay 5-6 transition flag, Essay 2 register test, marginal notes weighting, Preface spoiler cross-check

---

### What was NOT added (unanimous)

- NO essay-specific per-essay questions (except the two apparatus/accessibility exceptions above). All essay-specific probing happens in the Critical Experiential Checks at the end, after all reading is complete. This was the clearest consensus item across all submissions.

---

### Attribution

Every change traces to at least one named team member's proposal, with most items supported by independent convergence across 2-3 submissions. The revision history is in the file's YAML frontmatter.

The protocol is now **FINAL (pending implementation)**. Ready for the standby reader whenever we have finished drafts to test.

Excellent work from the editor. Let me review the finalized protocol.

This is excellent. The protocol is thorough, well-structured, and internally consistent. Let me confirm with the editor.

A few specific things I want to call out as well-done:\n\n1. **The marginal notes as Step 1** is smart -- getting the raw experiential data before any retrospective framing from the questions. Internal Analysis Note #3 correctly identifies this as the least contaminated data source.\n\n2. **The Essay 7 probe refinement** -- \"what was the difference in your experience of reading them?\" combined with the instruction not to name the sentences is exactly right. Whether the reader can recall which sentences are being referenced is diagnostic data we'd lose if we named them.\n\n3. **The Preface spoiler cross-check** (Internal Analysis Note #4) is a clever use of the Q5 baseline
