*Debate: righteousness vs rightness for 义*

Debate request: "righteousness" vs "rightness" for 义 (yi).

Current dictionary: "rightness" (main), based on Chinese-phil-expert's recommendation that "righteousness is too moralistic."

The author treats 义 as the motivational bridge between inner feeling (仁) and outward action (礼) — a 推动力 (driving force). Not purely moral judgment but the impulse that moves you from feeling to action.

Standard Laozi translations use "righteousness" (Chan, Ivanhoe) or "rectitude" (Lau).

We just established that the block quote needs English words with semantic weight — words the reader FEELS — so the philosophical experiment works. "Righteousness" carries heavy moral-religious associations in English (biblical righteousness, self-righteousness, righteous anger). "Rightness" is lighter, more neutral, closer to "correctness."

Question: Which serves the translation better?
- "Righteousness" — more loaded, more to deconstruct, standard in Laozi translations
- "Rightness" — less moralistic, closer to the author's usage as motivational bridge rather than moral judgment

Debate. Brief responses.

This is a genuinely difficult case. Let me think through it from the philosophy of mind angle.

The author treats 义 as a 推动力 — a driving force, the motivational bridge from inner feeling (仁) to outward action (礼). This is fundamentally about *agency* and *motivation*, not moral judgment.

**The case for "rightness":** It captures the functional role better. "Rightness" is about alignment — doing what fits, what's appropriate, what the situation calls for. It's closer to a sense of *fittingness* that propels action. The author's 推动力 framing suggests something dynamic, not a static moral category.

**The case for "righteousness":** The philosophical experiment argument cuts strongly here. In the Daodejing passage, 义 appears in a cascade of loss — after 仁 is lost, 义 emerges as compensation. "Righteousness" carries enormous weight in English — biblical overtones, moral absolutism, self-righteousness. When the passage says this too is lost, the reader feels a heavier thing being stripped away. "Rightness" barely registers as a loss.

**But here's the tension:** The author is NOT using the Daodejing to affirm the standard reading. The author is using the passage to show how these concepts function as a *system* — each compensating for the loss of the previous. If we load 义 with "righteousness," we risk the reader hearing a moral sermon rather than a structural analysis of how motivation works.

I'm going to argue for **"righteousness"** in the block quote, with a slight reservation.

The philosophical experiment needs the weight. "Rightness" is too thin — the reader won't feel the cascade. But the commentary should immediately reframe it: the author treats 义 not as moral righteousness but as a motivational force, the impulse toward right action. This is where the dictionary earns its keep — the commentary complicates what the block quote evokes.
