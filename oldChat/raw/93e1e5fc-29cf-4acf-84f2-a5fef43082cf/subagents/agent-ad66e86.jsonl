Here is my recommendation:\n\n**Primary recommendation: \"the poetic\" (lowercase in running text, capitalized when used as a substantive noun referring to the stance itself).**\n\n**Reasoning by elimination:**\n\n**Against \"poiesis\" (Option 2).** The Greek term imports Aristotelian baggage (poiesis vs. praxis vs. theoria) that the author explicitly does not invoke. In Aristotle, poiesis is instrumental making -- producing something external to the agent. The author's 诗意 is precisely NOT instrumental; the cat-raiser is not producing anything. Poiesis also has a Heideggerian technical usage (\"The Question Concerning Technology\") where it means \"bringing-forth\" as a mode of revealing. This is closer, but still over-identifies with Heidegger. Additionally, most English readers will simply not know this word, creating an unnecessary barrier.\n\n**Against \"poetic dwelling\" (Option 3).** This directly quotes Heidegger's reading of Holderlin (\"...dichterisch wohnet der Mensch...\"). The problem: it makes the author sound like a Heideggerian, which misrepresents the relationship. The author's 诗意 is *more agentic* than Gelassenheit and *more practical* than Heidegger's poetic dwelling. Heidegger's \"dwelling\" suggests receptivity and rootedness; the author's concept involves active *construction* of 境. Using Heidegger's phrase would subordinate the author's original concept to Heidegger's framework -- exactly the wrong move for a translation that should let the author's voice stand on its own.\n\n**Against the \"something else\" options (Option 4).** \"Lucid engagement\" captures the 清醒 dimension but loses the 诗 (poetic/creative) dimension entirely. \"Knowing play\" is too casual and game-theoretic. \"Creative dwelling\" is better but \"creative\" in English connotes artistic production or innovation, which is not quite right -- the cat-raiser is not being \"creative\" in the English sense.\n\n**For \"the poetic\" (Option 1).** Yes, there is a risk that English readers hear \"aesthetic.\" But this risk can be managed, and the term has decisive advantages:\n\n1. It preserves the Chinese term's own semantic range. 诗意 literally means \"the quality/sense of poetry\" -- it is already metaphorical in Chinese, extending poetry from a literary genre to a mode of existence. \"The poetic\" does the same thing in English.\n\n2. It has established philosophical precedent beyond Heidegger. Bachelard's *The Poetics of Space*, Ricoeur's *The Rule of Metaphor*, and the broader Continental tradition all use \"the poetic\" to mean something wider than versification -- a mode of world-making through language and imagination. English readers with philosophical training will recognize this expanded usage.\n\n3. It is short, memorable, and can function grammatically in all the positions 诗意 occupies in the Chinese text -- as adjective (\"a poetic stance\"), as noun (\"the poetic\"), as modifier (\"poetic engagement with...\").\n\n4. The \"aesthetic\" misreading is actually *self-correcting* in context. By the time the reader encounters the cat-raising example or the coin-flip passage, they will understand that \"the poetic\" does not mean \"pretty\" or \"literary\" -- it means lucid, self-aware engagement with constructed meaning. The text itself teaches the reader what the term means, which is precisely how the author intends 诗意 to work.\n\n**Context-specific variants:**\n\n- **Essay title (形而上学后的目的：诗意):** I recommend \"The Aim After Metaphysics: The Poetic\" -- with \"The Poetic\" capitalized as a proper philosophical term. This signals to the reader that 诗意 is a technical concept, not a description.\n\n- **Inline substantive usage** (when 诗意 names the stance): \"the poetic\" -- e.g., \"after metaphysics, one's stance toward meaning should be the poetic.\"\n\n- **Inline adjectival usage** (when describing something as having the quality of 诗意): \"poetic\" -- e.g., \"this is a poetic engagement with the dreamscape\" or \"the coin-flip is a poetic process.\"\n\n- **First occurrence:** At the first occurrence in each essay, I recommend a brief parenthetical: \"the poetic (诗意, shiyi)\" -- giving the reader the Chinese term and romanization so they can track it across essays and eventually hear the Chinese resonance.\n\n**One final note:** Do NOT use \"poetical.\" In English, \"poetical\" has an archaic, affected quality that would undermine the author's conversational directness. \"Poetic\" is the right form throughout.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"526ca99c-7a1b-431e-90fe-c23e0736310b","timestamp":"2026-02-10T22:22:49.618Z"}
