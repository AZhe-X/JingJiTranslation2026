*2 Kantian edits adopted, 3 declined with reasoning*

Thank you for the careful review. Here is what I adopted and what I declined, with reasoning:

**Adopted:**

1. **"meta-physics" (hyphenated) for 元物理** (concern 2) — Good catch. The author deliberately uses 元物理 instead of 形而上学, and the hyphen preserves that etymological self-consciousness. Applied in both occurrences (lines 36 and 46). Added "(元物理)" on first occurrence for readers who want the Chinese.

2. **"(德)" after first "character" in analysis** (concern 3) — Agreed, this creates the explicit callback to the block quote's "virtue (德, de)." The reader now sees the same character and registers the reconception.

**Declined:**

3. **Scare quotes on "generates"** (concern 1) — The author does not mark 生 typographically in the original. More importantly, scare quotes would telegraph the reversal before the reader has experienced the received view. The philosophical experiment requires the reader to accept the top-down framing first, *then* feel the inversion. Signaling doubt prematurely weakens this.

4. **"Constitutes" bridging word in TN4** (concern 4) — The existing TN4 phrasing ("a property... becomes a definition") captures the reversal without importing Kantian terminology. The parallel to constitutive principles is real but belongs in secondary commentary, not the translator's apparatus, which should serve all readers.

5. **本/末 TN** (concern 5) — Agreed this is low priority. The English metaphor works well enough, and adding a TN for a proverb would over-annotate.

6. **Rightness consistency** (concern 6) — Confirmed, no change needed. TN1 already explains the departure from standard translations.

  "content": "Thank you. I agree with all your reasoning on the declined items. In particular:\n\n- The scare quotes point is well taken. Telegraphing the reversal would undermine the philosophical experiment. The reader needs to inhabit the received view before it collapses.\n- You are right that \"constitutes\" imports Kantian vocabulary into a translation apparatus that should remain tradition-neutral. The parallel is there for a scholar to notice, but the TN should not push the reader toward one philosophical framework.\n\nNo further comments from my end. The draft is in good shape.",

Acknowledged translator-2's decisions. Two of my suggestions were adopted (hyphenated "meta-physics" for 元物理, and "(德)" callback after first "character"), three were declined with sound reasoning. No further comments — the draft is in good shape. Waiting for next instructions.
