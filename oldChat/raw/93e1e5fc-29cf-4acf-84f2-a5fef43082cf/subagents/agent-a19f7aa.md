*Confirm agreement on 文言 format convention*

Quick confirmation check. The author wants to know: do you all agree on the Classical Chinese Quotation Format convention below? Or does anyone disagree with any part of it?

### Classical Chinese Quotation Format

1. Present original 文言 text as a **block quote**
2. Follow with **glossed English translation** — key terms glossed on first occurrence as "English (漢字, pinyin)", e.g., "humaneness (仁, ren)"
3. After first introduction, use **plain English only** — e.g., just "humaneness"
4. 现象X compounds (现象仁, 现象礼, 现象义) keep the "phenomenal" prefix **always** — never drop it.

**Refinements:**
- Re-gloss briefly at register transitions — when the same term shifts from classical quotation to the author's modern analysis, add a brief "(仁)" reminder
- Only gloss philosophically load-bearing terms, not every content word
- For the author's coined compounds (现象仁 etc.), no romanization needed after first gloss — "phenomenal humaneness" is self-explanatory
- Make the 文言/modern Chinese boundary visible through formatting (block-indent for classical quotations vs. running text for the author's analysis)

Please reply with a simple YES (agree with all of it) or NO (disagree with specific parts — say which).
