*Vote: add Editor agent to team?*

VOTE: Should we add an **Editor agent** to the team?

An Editor agent would be responsible for reviewing translated drafts for English prose quality, consistency, readability, and stylistic coherence across the collection — distinct from the philosophical/terminological review the experts provide.

Two options:
A. **Yes** — add an Editor agent
B. **No** — no Editor agent needed (experts + translator handle everything)

Reply: "A" or "B" with a brief reason.

But neither role is specifically tasked with English prose quality — sentence rhythm, readability, register consistency, avoidance of translationese, and stylistic coherence across all essays in the collection. These are distinct editorial skills. A dedicated Editor agent would catch issues like awkward phrasing that is technically accurate, inconsistent tone between passages, or sentences that are faithful but unnecessarily opaque to an English reader. This is especially important for a philosophical text where clarity of expression directly affects whether the argument lands.",

Voted A (yes, add an Editor agent). The philosophical experts and translator cover accuracy and faithfulness, but dedicated editorial review for English prose quality is a distinct function that would strengthen the final product. Awaiting next steps.
