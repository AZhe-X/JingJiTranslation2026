It will cover cross-traditional connections, translation choices, and scholarly positioning — all the things that would be spoilers in front matter.\n\n2. **Move the spoiler content from the Preface to the Afterword** — specifically the structural claims paragraph (line 50: nihilism-as-consequence, absurdity dissolution + mechanism) and soften the Essay 3 punchline in the Experiential Sequences section.
