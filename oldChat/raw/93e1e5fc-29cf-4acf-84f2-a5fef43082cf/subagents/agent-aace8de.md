  "type": "message",
  "recipient": "team-lead",
  "content": "The work is methodologically self-aware and self-positioning — the author explicitly explains how the framework relates to existing traditions, acknowledges its own constructedness, and provides its own examples and demonstrations. An external introduction would impose a framing lens that risks pre-interpreting the work for the reader, which contradicts the author's own philosophical stance that the reader should encounter the experiential sequences directly and construct understanding from phenomena, not from someone else's metaphysical overlay.",
  "summary": "Work is self-positioning; external framing contradicts its method"
