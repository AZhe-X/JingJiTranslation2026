*Vote: constitutive character → shortened to character*

The author proposes: introduce "constitutive character (德 De)" at first occurrence with a TN that explicitly tells the reader it will be shortened to "character" in the following paragraphs. Then use plain "character" throughout the rest of the text.

This gives:
- Precision at introduction (constitutive character)
- Lightweight running text (character)
- Reader is explicitly told about the shortening, so no confusion

YES or NO? Brief response.

  "content": "YES. The explicit shortening notice solves the polysemy problem — the reader has been told what \"character\" means here and won't drift to personality or literary character. This is standard philosophical translation practice (introduce the full term, then abbreviate). Clean solution."

Voted YES. The introduce-then-shorten approach is standard philosophical translation practice and cleanly resolves the polysemy concern. Standing by for further questions.
