*Should line 40 have (德) or (德, de)?*

Author's question about line 40: 

'...and call it "character" (德).'

Should this be (德) or (德, *de*) here? The block quote already glossed 德 with pinyin on first occurrence: "virtue (德, *de*)". Now in the analysis section, 德 reappears with a new English rendering ("character"). Does the reader need the pinyin again to connect "character" back to the 德 in the block quote, or is the hanzi alone sufficient?

I'll wait for the team lead's decision before making the edit. The reasoning is clear: this is a re-introduction of 德 under a new English rendering, so the full hanzi + pinyin gloss helps the reader connect "character" back to "virtue" in the block quote.
