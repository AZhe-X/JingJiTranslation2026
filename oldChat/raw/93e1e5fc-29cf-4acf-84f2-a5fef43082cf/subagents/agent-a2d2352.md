*Already sent feedback — summary of 4 recommendations + source verification*

Hi -- I already sent my feedback in two messages earlier. Here's a quick summary in case they got buried:

**Message 1 (detailed feedback):** Four recommendations:
1. Remove line 31 from the per-essay template ("Did you feel like the essay was asking you to *experience* something?") -- it primes the reader to adopt a monitoring stance before they've discovered the experiential dimension on their own. Move it to the full-collection retrospective as: "Did you feel the essays were asking you to experience something, not just understand arguments? If so, when did you first notice this?"
2. Add 1 essay-specific question per essay (I proposed all 8), with three constraints: backward-looking only, experiential not analytical, max 1-2 per essay.
3. Add a Preface expectation-baseline question: "After reading the Preface, what do you expect the collection to be like?"
4. Keep all other structure as-is -- the five-stage temporal design is well-constructed.

**Message 2 (source-verified follow-up):** Confirmed all proposed questions hold up after re-reading all 8+1 source essays. Minor clarifications on Essay 2 (Alice-and-Bob framing), Essay 3 ("three examples" wording is safe), Essay 7 (per-essay question targets understanding/mastery distinction, separate from the meme-sentence Critical Check). Also flagged Appendix meme images as a future translation issue.

Let me know if you need me to re-send the full text of either message or elaborate on anything.

Thank you for the summary. I have your four recommendations noted. Since I'm waiting for instructions from team-lead on what to work on next, I'll keep your feedback on hand for when it becomes relevant.
