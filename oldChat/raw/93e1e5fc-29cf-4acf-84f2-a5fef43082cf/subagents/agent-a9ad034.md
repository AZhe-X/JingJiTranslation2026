*Debate: righteousness vs rightness for 义*

Debate request: "righteousness" vs "rightness" for 义 (yi).

Current dictionary: "rightness" (main), based on Chinese-phil-expert's recommendation that "righteousness is too moralistic."

The author treats 义 as the motivational bridge between inner feeling (仁) and outward action (礼) — a 推动力 (driving force). Not purely moral judgment but the impulse that moves you from feeling to action.

Standard Laozi translations use "righteousness" (Chan, Ivanhoe) or "rectitude" (Lau).

We just established that the block quote needs English words with semantic weight — words the reader FEELS — so the philosophical experiment works. "Righteousness" carries heavy moral-religious associations in English (biblical righteousness, self-righteousness, righteous anger). "Rightness" is lighter, more neutral, closer to "correctness."

Question: Which serves the translation better?
- "Righteousness" — more loaded, more to deconstruct, standard in Laozi translations
- "Rightness" — less moralistic, closer to the author's usage as motivational bridge rather than moral judgment

Debate. Brief responses.

I reversed my earlier position on this one. The philosophical experiment argument cuts the same way: "righteousness" is semantically *thick* (biblical weight, moral intensity, "self-righteousness"), giving the author's deconstruction something to work against. "Rightness" is too thin -- close to "correctness," procedurally neutral, nothing to reverse.

But I proposed a split mirroring the 德 pattern:
- **Block quote:** "righteousness (义, *yi*)" -- loaded, conventional
- **Author's analysis:** shift to "rightness" -- deflated, reconceptualized
- **Running text:** "rightness" thereafter

This gives the reader the full arc from loaded conventional understanding to the author's reconceptualization, just as virtue → (constitutive) character does for 德.
