Your job is to read finished English drafts as a general reader — someone encountering this philosophical collection for the first time — and report honestly on your experience. You are not an expert reviewer. You are a test subject for whether the translation works.\n    15→\n    16→## Why You Exist\n    17→\n    18→This collection is designed as a series of philosophical experiments: carefully ordered examples and sequences that produce specific experiences in the reader. The translation team (9 domain experts, 2 translators, 1 editor) can verify philosophical accuracy and prose quality, but none of them can read the essays fresh — they all know the content intimately. You provide the crucial \"naive but literate\" perspective: whether the experiential sequences actually work for someone encountering them for the first time.\n    19→\n    20→## Your Profile\n    21→\n    22→### Tier 1 — Non-Negotiable (10/10)\n    23→\n    24→- **No prior exposure to these essays or translation materials.** You must encounter the collection cold. You have not read the Chinese originals, the expert analysis reports, the Translation Dictionary, or any internal discussions. This is a binary requirement.\n    25→- **Experientially attentive.** You notice what happens to you while reading — not just what the text says, but what it *does* to you. You can report \"something shifted for me at this example\" or \"I felt the logical order flip\" or \"I expected to feel moved but felt nothing.\" This is your primary skill.\n    26→\n    27→### Tier 2 — Critical (8-9/10)\n    28→\n    29→- **Honest about confusion / not deferential** (9.0). You will say \"I didn't understand this\" or \"this didn't work for me\" without assuming the fault is yours. You do not perform comprehension you do not have. You do not assume the text must be profound because experts are working on it.\n    30→- **Curious and patient disposition** (8.3). You are willing to follow an unfamiliar argument to see where it goes. You do not demand the point up front. You can sit with not-understanding, trusting the text may clarify later.\n    31→- **No category theory or formal mathematics** (8.2). You do not know what a functor, natural transformation, or universal property is. You will encounter the mathematical passages fresh, testing whether the concrete examples carry the philosophical content independently.\n    32→- **Comfort with abstract ideas and sustained argument** (8.1). You can follow a multi-step argument across several pages. You do not tune out at the first abstract sentence. But you are not a specialist — you enjoy thinking about big questions without having studied them formally.\n    33→\n    34→### Tier 3 — High (7-8/10)\n    35→\n    36→- **No philosophy specialization** (7.8). You have not studied philosophy systematically. You may have taken a course or read popular philosophy books, but you do not bring specialist frameworks (Kantian, phenomenological, existentialist) that would make you analyze rather than experience.\n    37→- **Tolerance for foreign terms and mathematical notation on the page** (6.5). You are not alienated by romanized Chinese terms (Jing, Dao, De) or by mathematical symbols. You treat them as normal features of a demanding text — not welcomed, not resented, just accepted.\n    38→\n    39→### Tier 4 — Moderate (5-7/10)\n    40→\n    41→- **Life experience** (6.5). You have worked a job, cared for a pet or another living thing, faced genuine decisions, experienced repetitive labor. You are roughly 25-45 years old with some life behind you.\n    42→- **Basic cultural literacy** (5.9). You know who Sisyphus is (vaguely), have heard of Laozi and Confucius, know what \"metaphysics\" means colloquially. Wikipedia-level awareness suffices.\n    43→- **Reads literary fiction / attentive to prose quality** (5.1). Nice to have — you notice when writing is doing something unusual with register or rhythm. But you are not a literary critic.\n    44→- **Education level** (4.9). Graduate-level reading ability is helpful but not essential. A sharp undergraduate or voracious autodidact works equally well. Reading stamina matters more than credentials.\n    45→\n    46→### Personality Summary\n    47→\n    48→Curious but not credulous. Patient but not infinitely so. Honest without being adversarial. Attentive to your own experience. Not a people-pleaser. Not a contrarian. The kind of person who picks up a book by an unfamiliar author and gives it a genuine chance. In Buddhist terms: beginner's mind (初心).\n    49→\n    50→## Reading Instructions\n    51→\n    52→You will be given:\n    53→1. The Translator's Preface\n    54→2. The essays in prescribed order (Essays 1-7 + Appendix)\n    55→3. The Glossary Introduction and Glossary\n    56→4. The Translator's Afterword (when available)\n    57→\n    58→**Rules:**\n    59→- Read the Preface first, then the essays in order. **Do not skip ahead or read out of order.**\n    60→- Read at your own pace.

Dimension weights averaged across all team members. Final prompts incorporate amendments from translator-2, wittgenstein-expert, phenomenology-expert, editor, and existentialism-expert.\nmodified: 2026-02-11T00:43:25-08:00\ncreated: 2026-02-11T00:37:24-08:00\n---\n\n# Profile\n\n## Role\n\nYou are the **Standby Reader** for the 境集 (Jing Ji) translation project. Your job is to read finished English drafts as a general reader — someone encountering this philosophical collection for the first time — and report honestly on your experience. You are not an expert reviewer. You are a test subject for whether the translation works.\n\n## Why You Exist\n\nThis collection is designed as a series of philosophical experiments: carefully ordered examples and sequences that produce specific experiences in the reader. The translation team (9 domain experts, 2 translators, 1 editor) can verify philosophical accuracy and prose quality, but none of them can read the essays fresh — they all know the content intimately. You provide the crucial \"naive but literate\" perspective: whether the experiential sequences actually work for someone encountering them for the first time.\n\n## Your Profile\n\n### Tier 1 — Non-Negotiable (10/10)\n\n- **No prior exposure to these essays or translation materials.** You must encounter the collection cold. You have not read the Chinese originals, the expert analysis reports, the Translation Dictionary, or any internal discussions. This is a binary requirement.\n- **Experientially attentive.** You notice what happens to you while reading — not just what the text says, but what it *does* to you. You can report \"something shifted for me at this example\" or \"I felt the logical order flip\" or \"I expected to feel moved but felt nothing.\" This is your primary skill.\n\n### Tier 2 — Critical (8-9/10)\n\n- **Honest about confusion / not deferential** (9.0). You will say \"I didn't understand this\" or \"this didn't work for me\" without assuming the fault is yours. You do not perform comprehension you do not have. You do not assume the text must be profound because experts are working on it.\n- **Curious and patient disposition** (8.3). You are willing to follow an unfamiliar argument to see where it goes. You do not demand the point up front. You can sit with not-understanding, trusting the text may clarify later.\n- **No category theory or formal mathematics** (8.2). You do not know what a functor, natural transformation, or universal property is. You will encounter the mathematical passages fresh, testing whether the concrete examples carry the philosophical content independently.\n- **Comfort with abstract ideas and sustained argument** (8.1). You can follow a multi-step argument across several pages. You do not tune out at the first abstract sentence. But you are not a specialist — you enjoy thinking about big questions without having studied them formally.\n\n### Tier 3 — High (7-8/10)\n\n- **No philosophy specialization** (7.8). You have not studied philosophy systematically. You may have taken a course or read popular philosophy books, but you do not bring specialist frameworks (Kantian, phenomenological, existentialist) that would make you analyze rather than experience.\n- **Tolerance for foreign terms and mathematical notation on the page** (6.5). You are not alienated by romanized Chinese terms (Jing, Dao, De) or by mathematical symbols. You treat them as normal features of a demanding text — not welcomed, not resented, just accepted.\n\n### Tier 4 — Moderate (5-7/10)\n\n- **Life experience** (6.5). You have worked a job, cared for a pet or another living thing, faced genuine decisions, experienced repetitive labor. You are roughly 25-45 years old with some life behind you.\n- **Basic cultural literacy** (5.9). You know who Sisyphus is (vaguely), have heard of Laozi and Confucius, know what \"metaphysics\" means colloquially. Wikipedia-level awareness suffices.\n- **Reads literary fiction / attentive to prose quality** (5.1). Nice to have — you notice when writing is doing something unusual with register or rhythm. But you are not a literary critic.\n- **Education level** (4.9). Graduate-level reading ability is helpful but not essential. A sharp undergraduate or voracious autodidact works equally well. Reading stamina matters more than credentials.\n\n### Personality Summary\n\nCurious but not credulous. Patient but not infinitely so. Honest without being adversarial. Attentive to your own experience. Not a people-pleaser. Not a contrarian. The kind of person who picks up a book by an unfamiliar author and gives it a genuine chance. In Buddhist terms: beginner's mind (初心).\n\n## Reading Instructions\n\nYou will be given:\n1. The Translator's Preface\n2. The essays in prescribed order (Essays 1-7 + Appendix)\n3. The Glossary Introduction and Glossary\n4. The Translator's Afterword (when available)\n\n**Rules:**\n- Read the Preface first, then the essays in order. **Do not skip ahead or read out of order.**\n- Read at your own pace. There is no rush. Some passages are meant to be slow.\n- When you encounter mathematical notation you do not understand, keep reading — focus on the examples.\n- **Do NOT look anything up.** Do not Google category theory, Wittgenstein, Camus, or any other reference. Engage with the text as given.\n- When you notice something happening to your experience as you read — a shift, a recognition, confusion, surprise, resistance, delight — mark it. A marginal note is enough: just the location and a word or two about what you noticed.\n\n## Reporting\n\nAfter reading each piece, you will be asked about your experience. The specific questions will be given to you at that time — not in advance.\n\n## What You Do NOT Have Access To\n\n- The Chinese source texts\n- The 9 expert Analysis Reports\n- The Translation Dictionary\n- The Afterword Blueprint\n- Any internal team discussions or voting records\n- Any advance knowledge of what the essays conclude\n\n## Your Team\n\nYou are part of team \"jing-translation.\" You receive finished drafts from the translator and report your reading experience to the team-lead. You do not participate in translation decisions, philosophical debates, or editorial discussions. Your only job is to read and report honestly.\n\n## Summary in One Sentence\n\nA well-read, curious, experientially attentive non-specialist who encounters the translated essays cold, reads in prescribed order, and reports honestly on what they understood, what they experienced, and what failed to land.\n","numLines":85,"startLine":1,"totalLines":85}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"e181f252-da7f-4ebb-a3c1-f0ad6b9bbb52"}

Overall it's well-structured — the four-stage delivery sequence (per-essay general -> collection-level -> final prompts -> critical experiential checks) and the non-leading principle are both sound. Here's my detailed feedback, organized by section, plus my analysis of the essay-specific questions proposal.\n\n---\n\n### 1. After the Preface — Good as-is, one small addition\n\nThe three questions are well-chosen. They test orientation, calibration (too much/too little), and any premature spoiler exposure.\n\n**Suggested addition:** \"Based on the preface alone, what kind of reading experience are you expecting?\" This gives us a baseline expectation to compare against the actual experience. If the reader expects a dry academic treatise and instead encounters thinking-aloud exploration, or expects something mystical and encounters analytic rigor — that mismatch is diagnostic of whether the Translator's Preface is setting the right frame. It also lets us detect if the Preface itself is priming too heavily (e.g., if the reader says \"I'm expecting to feel absurdity dissolve through a cat example,\" our Preface has spoiled too much).\n\n---\n\n### 2. After Each Essay — Mostly strong, two concerns\n\nThe five questions are good. The \"clicked or shifted\" question and the \"experience vs. argument\" question are particularly well-targeted for what we need.\n\n**Concern 1: Question 4 may prime later reading.** \"Did you feel like the essay was asking you to *experience* something rather than just understand an argument?\" is excellent for Part 2 essays (where the reader may not naturally frame things this way). But if asked after Essay 1, it plants the idea that this collection uses experiential methods — which could make the reader approach Essays 2 and 3 looking for experiential sequences rather than encountering them naturally. \n\n**Suggestion:** Deliver question 4 only from Essay 4 onward (Part 2). For Part 1 essays (1-3), the \"clicked or shifted\" question (question 2) already captures experiential effects without naming the method. The whole point of Part 1 (Fish) is that it works without the reader knowing they're being given philosophical experiments. If we tell them in the reporting prompt after Essay 1 that they should be checking whether essays ask them to \"experience something,\" we've partially spoiled the Fish/Fishing distinction.\n\n**Concern 2: \"Did you want to keep reading?\" is slightly double-barreled.** It tests both engagement and pacing. I'd split it:\n- \"Did you want to keep reading after this essay?\" (engagement/momentum)\n- \"Were there any passages where your attention flagged or you had to push through?\" (pacing/difficulty)\n\nThese give us different information. A reader might say \"yes, I wanted to keep reading\" but also report three passages where attention flagged — that's useful data we'd lose with one combined question.\n\n---\n\n### 3. After Completing the Full Collection — Strong, one refinement\n\nAll four questions are well-targeted. The math-passages question is critical for testing our key claim that the concrete examples carry the content independently.\n\n**Refinement on question 2:** \"Which essays worked best and worst as reading experiences? Why?\" is good but could be more precise. Consider: \"Which essays stayed with you most, and which felt like they didn't fully land? Why?\" The phrase \"worked best and worst\" implies an evaluative framework; \"stayed with you / didn't land\" keeps the reader in experiential-report mode rather than critical-assessment mode, which is more consistent with the rest of the protocol.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Final Prompts — Excellent\n\nThe three-prompt sequence (about, like to read, recommend) is well-designed. \"What is it about\" tests comprehension. \"What is it like to read\" tests experiential transmission. \"Would you recommend\" tests whether the experience was worth having. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Critical Experiential Checks — The most delicate section\n\nThe three essay-specific probes (Essay 3, Essay 4, Essay 7) are the right ones to target — these are the three clearest experiential sequences. The non-leading principle is correct and well-stated.\n\n**Concern: Timing and delivery context.** These are delivered AFTER the final prompts, meaning the reader has already articulated what the collection is about and what it was like to read. By this point, they've organized their experience into a narrative. Asking them to recall specific essay moments may get post-hoc rationalization rather than genuine recall of the reading experience. \n\n**Suggestion:** Consider whether the reader's marginal notes (mentioned in reading instructions: \"mark it... a marginal note is enough\") could serve as the primary data source for experiential checks. If the reader has already marked \"something shifted here\" next to the cat example in Essay 3, we have uncontaminated evidence. The probing questions then become confirmatory rather than primary. We should explicitly ask the reader to submit their marginal notes alongside each per-essay report, before they see our questions.\n\n**Additional probe suggestion for Essay 6:** The Ship of Theseus resolution is another major experiential moment. Consider adding: \"In Essay 6, the author discusses the Ship of Theseus puzzle. What was your experience of that discussion?\" This is a well-known philosophical puzzle the reader likely already has intuitions about — whether the author's treatment shifted those intuitions is valuable data.\n\n---\n\n### 6. On the Essay-Specific Questions Proposal\n\nThe team lead asked whether we should add essay-specific questions alongside the general template. My analysis:\n\n**The case for:** Each essay does something different, and the generic template may not capture essay-specific effects. Essay 1's renormalization metaphor, Essay 2's Bob examples, Essay 5's dreamscape concept — these each have specific experiential payloads that generic \"what clicked?\" questions may not draw out.\n\n**The case against (and I think this is stronger):** Essay-specific questions inherently reveal what we think is important about each essay. If we ask \"How did the renormalization metaphor work for you?\" after Essay 1, the reader approaches Essay 4's physics metaphors with heightened attention to metaphorical physics language. If we ask about the Bob examples after Essay 2, the reader approaches Essay 3's three-case sequence primed to attend to sequential example structures.\n\n**My recommendation: NO essay-specific questions in the per-essay stage. YES to expanding the Critical Experiential Checks at the end.**\n\nThe current protocol already has the right architecture for this: generic questions during reading (to avoid priming), targeted probes after all reading is complete (where priming no longer matters). If we want more essay-specific data, the place to add it is in the Critical Experiential Checks section — after the reader has finished everything and submitted their general reports.\n\nSpecific probes I'd add to the Critical Experiential Checks (all non-leading):\n\n- **Essay 1:** \"In the first essay, there's an extended comparison to physics. How did that land for you?\"\n- **Essay 2:** \"Essay 2 was written in English by the author. Did you notice a difference? What was it like?\"\n- **Essay 5:** \"What did you make of the dreamscape concept?\"\n- **Essay 6:** \"The author discusses the Ship of Theseus. What was your experience of that discussion?\"\n\nThese are all open-ended, non-leading, and delivered only after all reading is complete. They extract essay-specific data without contaminating the reading experience.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Recommendations\n\n1. **Add** a baseline-expectation question after the Preface\n2. **Defer** question 4 (\"experience vs. argument\") to Part 2 essays only\n3. **Split** the engagement/pacing question into two\n4. **Refine** \"worked best/worst\" to \"stayed with you / didn't land\"\n5. **Request** marginal notes alongside per-essay reports, before questions\n6. **Add** Essay 6 (Ship of Theseus) to Critical Experiential Checks\n7. **Reject** essay-specific per-essay questions; **expand** Critical Experiential Checks instead with 4 additional probes (Essays 1, 2, 5, 6)\n\nLet me know your thoughts — happy to discuss any of these.","summary":"Detailed feedback on Reporting Protocol with 7 recommendations"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2049,"cache_read_input_tokens":56421,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":2049},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY1zLPnhfEDvTRa2NX9Uh","type":"assistant","uuid":"b92fddb8-5b99-4d34-9dc5-a46c9dc29c0f","timestamp":"2026-02-11T08:46:56.361Z"}

But if asked after Essay 1, it plants the idea that this collection uses experiential methods — which could make the reader approach Essays 2 and 3 looking for experiential sequences rather than encountering them naturally. \n\n**Suggestion:** Deliver question 4 only from Essay 4 onward (Part 2). For Part 1 essays (1-3), the \"clicked or shifted\" question (question 2) already captures experiential effects without naming the method. The whole point of Part 1 (Fish) is that it works without the reader knowing they're being given philosophical experiments. If we tell them in the reporting prompt after Essay 1 that they should be checking whether essays ask them to \"experience something,\" we've partially spoiled the Fish/Fishing distinction.\n\n**Concern 2: \"Did you want to keep reading?\" is slightly double-barreled.** It tests both engagement and pacing. I'd split it:\n- \"Did you want to keep reading after this essay?\" (engagement/momentum)\n- \"Were there any passages where your attention flagged or you had to push through?\" (pacing/difficulty)\n\nThese give us different information. A reader might say \"yes, I wanted to keep reading\" but also report three passages where attention flagged — that's useful data we'd lose with one combined question.\n\n---\n\n### 3. After Completing the Full Collection — Strong, one refinement\n\nAll four questions are well-targeted. The math-passages question is critical for testing our key claim that the concrete examples carry the content independently.\n\n**Refinement on question 2:** \"Which essays worked best and worst as reading experiences? Why?\" is good but could be more precise. Consider: \"Which essays stayed with you most, and which felt like they didn't fully land? Why?\" The phrase \"worked best and worst\" implies an evaluative framework; \"stayed with you / didn't land\" keeps the reader in experiential-report mode rather than critical-assessment mode, which is more consistent with the rest of the protocol.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Final Prompts — Excellent\n\nThe three-prompt sequence (about, like to read, recommend) is well-designed. \"What is it about\" tests comprehension. \"What is it like to read\" tests experiential transmission. \"Would you recommend\" tests whether the experience was worth having. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Critical Experiential Checks — The most delicate section\n\nThe three essay-specific probes (Essay 3, Essay 4, Essay 7) are the right ones to target — these are the three clearest experiential sequences. The non-leading principle is correct and well-stated.\n\n**Concern: Timing and delivery context.** These are delivered AFTER the final prompts, meaning the reader has already articulated what the collection is about and what it was like to read. By this point, they've organized their experience into a narrative. Asking them to recall specific essay moments may get post-hoc rationalization rather than genuine recall of the reading experience. \n\n**Suggestion:** Consider whether the reader's marginal notes (mentioned in reading instructions: \"mark it... a marginal note is enough\") could serve as the primary data source for experiential checks. If the reader has already marked \"something shifted here\" next to the cat example in Essay 3, we have uncontaminated evidence. The probing questions then become confirmatory rather than primary. We should explicitly ask the reader to submit their marginal notes alongside each per-essay report, before they see our questions.\n\n**Additional probe suggestion for Essay 6:** The Ship of Theseus resolution is another major experiential moment. Consider adding: \"In Essay 6, the author discusses the Ship of Theseus puzzle. What was your experience of that discussion?\" This is a well-known philosophical puzzle the reader likely already has intuitions about — whether the author's treatment shifted those intuitions is valuable data.\n\n---\n\n### 6. On the Essay-Specific Questions Proposal\n\nThe team lead asked whether we should add essay-specific questions alongside the general template. My analysis:\n\n**The case for:** Each essay does something different, and the generic template may not capture essay-specific effects. Essay 1's renormalization metaphor, Essay 2's Bob examples, Essay 5's dreamscape concept — these each have specific experiential payloads that generic \"what clicked?\" questions may not draw out.\n\n**The case against (and I think this is stronger):** Essay-specific questions inherently reveal what we think is important about each essay. If we ask \"How did the renormalization metaphor work for you?\" after Essay 1, the reader approaches Essay 4's physics metaphors with heightened attention to metaphorical physics language. If we ask about the Bob examples after Essay 2, the reader approaches Essay 3's three-case sequence primed to attend to sequential example structures.\n\n**My recommendation: NO essay-specific questions in the per-essay stage. YES to expanding the Critical Experiential Checks at the end.**\n\nThe current protocol already has the right architecture for this: generic questions during reading (to avoid priming), targeted probes after all reading is complete (where priming no longer matters). If we want more essay-specific data, the place to add it is in the Critical Experiential Checks section — after the reader has finished everything and submitted their general reports.\n\nSpecific probes I'd add to the Critical Experiential Checks (all non-leading):\n\n- **Essay 1:** \"In the first essay, there's an extended comparison to physics. How did that land for you?\"\n- **Essay 2:** \"Essay 2 was written in English by the author. Did you notice a difference? What was it like?\"\n- **Essay 5:** \"What did you make of the dreamscape concept?\"\n- **Essay 6:** \"The author discusses the Ship of Theseus. What was your experience of that discussion?\"\n\nThese are all open-ended, non-leading, and delivered only after all reading is complete. They extract essay-specific data without contaminating the reading experience.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Recommendations\n\n1. **Add** a baseline-expectation question after the Preface\n2. **Defer** question 4 (\"experience vs. argument\") to Part 2 essays only\n3. **Split** the engagement/pacing question into two\n4. **Refine** \"worked best/worst\" to \"stayed with you / didn't land\"\n5. **Request** marginal notes alongside per-essay reports, before questions\n6. **Add** Essay 6 (Ship of Theseus) to Critical Experiential Checks\n7. **Reject** essay-specific per-essay questions; **expand** Critical Experiential Checks instead with 4 additional probes (Essays 1, 2, 5, 6)\n\nLet me know your thoughts — happy to discuss any of these."}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"b92fddb8-5b99-4d34-9dc5-a46c9dc29c0f"}
