*Update Afterword blueprint with poet/Dichter + Chan parallel*

11/11 voted B. Please update the Afterword Blueprint in your directory to include the poet/Dichter finding under Section B (existentialist positioning). Also add buddhism-expert's note about the Chan/Zen parallel (Buddha-nature / 见性) to the Buddhist subsection.
