The passage 故失道而后德，失德而后仁，失仁而后义，失义而后礼 (Dao De Jing Ch. 38) has well-established standard English translations:\n\n**D.C. Lau**: \"When the way was lost there was virtue; when virtue was lost there was benevolence; when benevolence was lost there was rectitude; when rectitude was lost there were the rites.\"\n\n**Wing-tsit Chan**: \"When the Way is lost, only then do we have virtue; when virtue is lost, only then do we have humanity; when humanity is lost, only then do we have righteousness; when righteousness is lost, only then do we have propriety.\"\n\n**James Legge**: \"When the Tao was lost, its attributes appeared; when its attributes were lost, benevolence appeared; when benevolence was lost, righteousness appeared; when righteousness was lost, the proprieties appeared.\"\n\nEvery major translator uses \"virtue\" for 德 in this passage. Our decision was \"(constitutive) character\" instead.\n\nGiven this data — does this change your view? Should we:\nA) Keep \"(constitutive) character\" — our reasoned departure from tradition, acknowledged in TN\nB) Use the standard \"virtue\" for the Laozi block quote specifically (since it IS a quotation of a classical text), then switch to \"(constitutive) character\" when the author begins their own analysis\nC) Something else?\n\nBrief response with your recommendation.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"c2d71bcb-6fd2-4974-8d23-7a05470ab914","timestamp":"2026-02-11T02:00:03.377Z"}
