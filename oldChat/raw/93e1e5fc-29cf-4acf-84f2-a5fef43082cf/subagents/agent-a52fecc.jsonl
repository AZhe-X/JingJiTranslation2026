Let me think about this carefully from the translator's perspective.\n\n**Considerations:**\n\n- The Key Terminological Decisions section is currently ~800 words (lines 83-149 of the Preface)\n- Moving it to a glossary introduction would cut the Preface from ~2,500 to ~1,700 words\n- The Preface would retain a clean narrative arc: title → author → structure → bilingual → 形 reinterpretation → experiential sequences → reading advice\n- The terminology discussion would sit adjacent to the glossary itself, where readers would actually consult it\n\nAs translator-2, I need to consider: does the reader need the terminology *before* reading the essays, or is it better placed as reference material?\n\nThe key insight is that the Preface should prepare the reader to *enter* the essays, not to look up terms. The terminology section is reference material — readers will return to it when they encounter terms, not read it cover-to-cover before Essay 1. That's glossary behavior, not preface behavior.\n\nHowever, one concern: the \"On the Title\" section already discusses Jing extensively, and the \"Reinterpretation of 形\" section already introduces the metaphysical/metaphysics distinction. So the most critical terms are already embedded in the narrative sections. The remaining terminology entries (constancy, the non-rational, the Poetic, dreamscape, vain presumption, the Dao-De sequence, Three Realities, etc.) are indeed better suited to a glossary introduction."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":169,"cache_read_input_tokens":53879,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":169},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY1p4oMRz27jLiUB2akNy","type":"assistant","uuid":"5f5932bb-1416-42c4-86e5-d42bff1b0273","timestamp":"2026-02-11T06:31:37.124Z"}
