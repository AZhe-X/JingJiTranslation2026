  "content": "The work's epistemological method is self-grounding: the author's \"access argument\" establishes that justification ultimately rests on what is experientially available, and the essays themselves function as philosophical experiments that produce their own evidence in the reader. A work whose core thesis is that knowledge reduces to belief and whose method is to awaken structural experiences directly in the reader does not need external authority to validate it — that would contradict the very epistemological stance the collection advances.",
  "summary": "Work is epistemologically self-grounding, external intro would contradict its thesis"
