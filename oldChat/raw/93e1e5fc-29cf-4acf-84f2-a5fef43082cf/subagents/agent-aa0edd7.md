*Vote on Foreword — yes/no/optional, with reasons*

ALL TEAM MEMBERS (experts, translator-2, editor):

Vote: **Should this collection include a Foreword?**

Reminder: A Foreword is written by someone other than the author or translator — typically a scholar, philosopher, or expert who can position the work for the reader. The Translator's Preface (DRAFT-R2) is already done and confirmed.

The question is: in addition to the Translator's Preface, should there be a Foreword?

Options:
- **YES** — include a Foreword
- **NO** — Translator's Preface is sufficient
- **OPTIONAL** — nice to have but not necessary

Please vote AND give a brief reason (1-2 sentences). Everyone votes.

  "type": "message",

  "content": "**OPTIONAL** — A Foreword by a respected scholar (ideally someone working at the intersection of Chinese philosophy and Western metaphysics/phenomenology, or philosophy of mathematics) would lend significant credibility and help position this unusual work for an academic audience unfamiliar with it. However, the Translator's Preface already does excellent framing work, and the collection can stand on its own without a Foreword. The right Foreword would add real value; the wrong one (a generic endorsement or one that misframes the project) could actually harm the reader's engagement. Better to publish without one than to publish with a poor fit.",
