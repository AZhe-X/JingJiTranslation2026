*Does 现象X feel heavy or light in Chinese?*

I have an editorial question about the reading experience of the 现象X compounds in the original Chinese.

In Essay 4's 道德仁义礼 passage, the author's coined terms 现象礼, 现象仁, 现象义 appear repeatedly — sometimes 5-6 times in a single paragraph. In English, these become "phenomenal ritual conduct" (8 syllables), "phenomenal humaneness" (7 syllables), "phenomenal rightness" (6 syllables). The English is quite heavy.

My question: **For a native Chinese reader, does the repetition of 现象X in these paragraphs create any sense of heaviness, unusual density, or deliberate accumulation? Or does the 3-character compactness make these compounds feel natural and light — just another term flowing in the sentence?**

This determines my editing strategy:
- If the Chinese feels **light/natural**, I should manage the English density aggressively — punctuation, sentence rhythm, breathing room — so the English reader's experience matches the Chinese reader's.
- If the Chinese feels **deliberately heavy/accumulative**, I should let the English weight stand, because the density is part of the intended reading experience.

This is an excellent editorial question. Let me think carefully about the Chinese reading experience before responding.

Good, I've re-read the key paragraphs. Now let me give a careful, linguistically informed answer.

The answer is **both, in different ways** — and the distinction matters for your editing strategy.\n\n**The compounds themselves are light.** 现象礼 is three characters, three syllables, read in under a second. Chinese readers process 现象 as a single unit (like \"pheno-\") and 礼 as a familiar monosyllable. The compound is compact the way \"subtext\" or \"feedback\" is in English — coined but immediately parseable. The same goes for 现象仁 and 现象义. At the individual-occurrence level, these feel like natural technical coinages, not heavy constructions. A Chinese reader does not stumble on any single instance.\n\n**But the repetition is deliberately dense and accumulative.** Re-read line 24 of the original: 现象礼 appears
