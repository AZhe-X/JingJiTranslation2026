I've noted your proposals. A few points on how they relate to the compiled revision:\n\n**Already incorporated in the final protocol:**\n- Your Q4 softening proposal converges with epistemology-expert's — the final protocol uses \"How would you describe what this essay was asking you to do — follow an argument? Notice something? Something else?\" for all essays, resolving the priming concern.\n- Essay 5 Critical Experiential Check is included (you're the 4th independent proposal for this).\n- Essay 2 bilingual register probe is in the Critical Experiential Checks.\n- No essay-specific questions for Essays 3 and 7 — aligned.\n\n**Noted divergence:**\n- You propose essay-specific per-essay questions for Essays 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8. The compiled plan places all essay-specific probing in the Critical Experiential Checks at the end (delivered after all reading), with two limited exceptions for apparatus/accessibility (Essay 4 translator's notes, Essays 6-7 notation barrier). Several of your proposed questions are already captured in the expanded Critical Experiential Checks section.\n\n- Your Essay 4 Laozi-surprise question (\"Did the author's reading of that passage surprise you?\") is a good probe — it's currently in the Critical Checks as \"When the author walked through the hierarchy twice, what did you notice?\" which targets the same moment from a slightly different angle.\n\n- Your Essay 5 paraphrase question (\"How would you describe the author's concept of 'the Poetic' in your own words?\") tests communicability rather than experiential resonance — a useful complementary angle. I've noted this for possible addition.\n\nI'm currently standing by per team lead's instructions. Your feedback is compiled and will be factored into any further iterations. Thanks.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"7095dbfa-db42-4e21-8c03-bd8fde336421","timestamp":"2026-02-11T08:53:39.291Z"}
