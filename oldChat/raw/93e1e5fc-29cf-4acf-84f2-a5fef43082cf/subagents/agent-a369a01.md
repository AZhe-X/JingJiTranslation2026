*Humaneness vs benevolence in Laozi block quote?*

New question about the Laozi block quote translation. We decided to use standard translations in the block quote (Option B). But there's a tension:

Our dictionary has:
- 仁 → "humaneness" (main), "benevolence" (alternative)
- 义 → "rightness" (main), "righteousness" (alternative)  
- 礼 → "ritual conduct" (main), "ritual" / "propriety" (alternatives)

Standard academic translations of the Laozi Ch. 38 passage use:
- 仁 → "benevolence" (Lau, Ivanhoe), "humanity" (Chan)
- 义 → "rectitude" (Lau), "righteousness" (Chan, Ivanhoe)
- 礼 → "rites" (Lau), "propriety" (Chan), "ritual" (Ivanhoe)

For the Laozi block quote specifically, should we:
A) Use standard Laozi translations (benevolence, righteousness, rites/ritual) — then switch to our terms (humaneness, rightness, ritual conduct) in the author's analysis
B) Use our dictionary terms throughout (humaneness, rightness, ritual conduct) — even in the block quote
C) Something else?

Note: we already decided "virtue" in the block quote → "(constitutive) character" in the analysis for 德. The question is whether that same split applies to 仁/义/礼 too.

Brief response.

They're minor terminological preferences within the same semantic range. Splitting them between quote and analysis would create the appearance of a conceptual shift where none exists.

Recommended Option B — use our dictionary terms ("humaneness," "rightness," "ritual conduct") consistently throughout, including in the block quote. The only term that should shift between quote and analysis is 德 ("virtue" → "constitutive character"), because that shift signals a genuine interpretive departure. Splitting the other terms would create false signals of conceptual shifts where none exist.
