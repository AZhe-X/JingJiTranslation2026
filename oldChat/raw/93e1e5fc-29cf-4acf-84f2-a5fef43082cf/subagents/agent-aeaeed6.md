Sent detailed feedback on the Translator's Preface to the team lead. My review covered nine points, with the highest-priority recommendations being:

1. **Missing content**: The Preface needs brief treatment of the absurd and its dissolution (a genuine philosophical contribution — the absurd as structural Jing-collapse, not irreducible condition) and the nihilism-metaphysics relationship (nihilism as *consequence* of metaphysics, not its negation).

2. **Refinements to existing sections**: Sharper Heidegger differentiation for "The Poetic," structural clarification of the dream metaphor in "Dreamscape," existentialist targeting of "Vain Presumption," and phenomenological precision for the 现象/Husserl comparison.

3. **Praise**: The "Constancy," "Non-Rational," and "Experiential Sequences" sections are excellent as written. The Experiential Sequences section is the strongest part of the Preface.
