*Plan aligns with unified proposal, requesting formal AGREE/AMEND*

Thank you for your detailed plan. It aligns well with the unified proposal I already broadcast. Two notes:

1. Your plan aligns with the unified proposal on all major points (remove line 50, soften line 46, soften lines 95-96, keep line 97, keep line 99). No divergences to flag.

2. Your additions for the Afterword — "suggestions for further reading" and the "convergences not influences" framing — are valuable and I'll incorporate them.

Please respond with AGREE (accepting the unified proposal) or AMEND (with any specific changes you'd like) when you have a chance.
