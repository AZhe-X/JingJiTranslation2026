All 5 recommendations have been addressed:\n\n1. **套用 → \"imposed...onto\"** — Already changed. You and the phil-mind expert flagged this independently. The draft now reads \"I have merely **imposed** my explanation...onto the phenomenal ritual conduct we observe **others** performing.\"\n\n2. **Parentheses → italics for (can)/(should)** — Not adopted. I checked the original Chinese: the author uses parentheses + bold — （**可以**）and （**应该**）. Our \"(**can**)\" and \"(**should**)\" mirrors the source format exactly. Removing parentheses would depart from the author's own typographic choice.\n\n3. **\"Paper\" for 画纸** — Already changed from \"canvas.\" Footnote 24 now reads \"the paper on which a painting is made.\"\n\n4. **失 echo TN** — Deferred. The echo is preserved in the text (\"lost\" in the quote, \"**lost**\" at line 46), and the existentialism expert also validated this. Adding a TN would over-annotate.\n\n5. **TN3 universality of 德** — Already added. TN3 now includes: \"Crucially, the author extends 德 beyond persons to all things (凡事诸物皆有其德): every entity has its 'character,' the regularity that makes it what it is.\"\n\nYour analysis of the 解释 pivot and the language-game structure of the argument was particularly valuable — it confirms that the key logical moves survive the translation. No new changes needed from your review.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"a08316c5-bf60-47fc-981a-b00fbaa26ad1","timestamp":"2026-02-11T03:38:31.321Z"}
