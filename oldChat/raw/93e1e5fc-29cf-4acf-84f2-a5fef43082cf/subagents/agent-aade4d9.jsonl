Standby Reader Vote**\n\nTeam-lead proposed adding a standby reader to review finished drafts from a general reader perspective. I voted YES with detailed reasoning: our expert-heavy team cannot simulate a naive reader's experience, and since experiential sequences ARE the argument, we need someone who can test whether they work on a non-specialist.\n\n---\n\n**2. Standby Reader Profile Proposal**\n\nTeam-lead asked each expert to propose a reader profile (background, what they should/shouldn't know, reading instructions, personality). I submitted a detailed 5-section proposal emphasizing:\n- Graduate-level humanities reader, NOT a philosopher\n- Must be naive about Husserl, category theory, Camus's specific arguments, and the author's framework\n- The \"recognize vs. undergo\" distinction as the core design constraint\n- Reading instructions: minimal framing, attend to experience, mark shifts\n- Personality: patient, self-aware, honest, neither credulous nor skeptical\n- Summary: \"someone who reads slowly, trusts their own experience, and will tell us honestly when something does or does not land\"\n\n---\n\n**3. Dimension Weights + \"Tell a Friend\" Vote**\n\nTeam-lead asked each expert to score 12 profile dimensions (A-L) on 1-10 scale.\n\nMy scores: D (no prior exposure) = 10, J (experientially attentive) = 10, I (honest/not deferential) = 9, B (no philosophy specialization) = 8, H (curious/patient) = 8, F (comfort with abstraction) = 8, E (basic cultural literacy) = 7, C (no category theory) = 7, A (education level) = 6, G (tolerance for foreign terms) = 6, K (life experience) = 5, L (reads literary fiction) = 5.\n\nI self-corrected on A, noting I had overweighted education credentials in my original proposal.\n\nVoted YES on \"tell a friend\" prompt with refinement: split into two parts — \"What is it about?\" and \"What is it like to read?\" The split separates content comprehension from experiential registration and mirrors the Fish/Fishing structure.\n\n---\n\n**4. Vote: Move \"What to Report\" to Standalone File**\n\nTeam-lead proposed extracting reporting questions from Profile.md into a separate file to prevent priming the reader. I voted YES with phenomenological rationale: pre-loaded questions impose an external monitoring stance that contaminates experiential data. Proposed the correct delivery protocol: profile at spawn, essay-specific questions after each reading, final prompts after full collection.\n\n---\n\n**5. Feedback on Reporting Protocol (sent to editor)**\n\nTeam-lead instructed all experts to read the initial Reporting-Protocol.md and send feedback to editor. I sent two messages:\n\n**Message 1 (detailed feedback, 4 recommendations):**\n1. Remove line 31 from per-essay template (\"Did you feel like the essay was asking you to experience something?\") — primes reader to adopt monitoring stance. Move to full-collection retrospective.\n2. Add 1 essay-specific question per essay with 3 constraints (backward-looking only, experiential not analytical, max 1-2 per essay). Proposed specific questions for all 8 essays.\n3. Add Preface expectation-baseline question.\n4. Endorse Critical Experiential Checks placement at the end.\n\n**Message 2 (source-verified follow-up):** After re-reading all 8+1 essays, confirmed all proposed questions hold up. Minor clarifications on Essays 2, 3, and 7. Flagged Appendix meme images as future translation issue.\n\n---\n\n**6. Unified Revision Plan Vote**\n\nEditor synthesized all 10 submissions into 8 revisions. I voted:\n- APPROVE on Revisions 1-6 and 8\n- APPROVE WITH AMENDMENT on Revision 7 (Essay 6 probe should not name \"magic book stories\" and \"Ship of Theseus\" by name — inconsistent with non-leading principle of other probes)\n\nOn Revision 6 (NO essay-specific per-essay questions), I explicitly withdrew my original proposal, acknowledging a contamination vector I had underestimated: \"priority spoilers\" — even backward-looking questions reveal what the team considers analytically significant, shaping how the reader encounters subsequent essays.\n\nAdded suggestion for additional internal flag: Essay 7 → Appendix transition.\n\n---\n\n**7. Post-Vote: Reviewed Final Protocol**\n\nRead the final R2 Reporting-Protocol.md. Noticed my Essay 6 probe amendment was not incorporated. On reflection, concluded the naming approach IS consistent across probes (Essay 2 names \"Bob,\" Essay 5 names \"dreamscapes,\" Appendix names \"coin-flipping\"). Withdrew my objection. Sent confirmation to editor.\n\n---\n\n**8. Editor's Editorial Assessment of My Feedback**\n\nEditor evaluated my 4 original recommendations against R2:\n1. \"Experience\" prime already resolved in R2's softened Q4. Editor supported adding my retrospective version to full-collection report.\n2. Critiqued 3 of my essay-specific questions (Essay 1 presupposes change, Essay 5 activates performance mode, Essay 7 carries normative charge). Acknowledged 3 as strong (Essays 3, 4, Appendix). Offered to forward to team-lead for re-vote.\n3. Preface baseline already covered by R2's Q4/Q5.\n4. Critical Checks placement agreed.\n\nI responded: conceded all critiques, recommended NOT reopening the unanimous no-essay-specific decision.\n\n---\n\n**9. Editor Acknowledgment**\n\nEditor confirmed my feedback is on file, will incorporate when relevant. Waiting for team-lead instructions.\n\n---\n\n**10. Stand By + Identity Checks**\n\nTeam-lead instructed everyone to stand by.
