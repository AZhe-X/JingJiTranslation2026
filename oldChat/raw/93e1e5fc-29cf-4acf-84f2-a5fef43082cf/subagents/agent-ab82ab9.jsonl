Make your case, respond to the other positions, and see if you can reach consensus. Is the pejorative connotation of \"intoxicated\" a feature (the author IS describing a state of unknowing) or a bug (the author is not morally condemning pre-metaphysical existence)?\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"18fbf810-c983-4225-8d35-5c97c4d86456","timestamp":"2026-02-11T00:37:44.664Z"}
