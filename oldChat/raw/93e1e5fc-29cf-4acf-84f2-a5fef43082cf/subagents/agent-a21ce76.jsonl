My original recommendation was to cut Q4 entirely (folding it into a more open Q2), but deferring it to Part 2 is a reasonable compromise that preserves the Fish/Fishing naivete while still gathering that data for the methodologically explicit essays.\n\n---\n\n**REVISION 3: Split engagement/pacing question**\n**APPROVE.** Epistemology-expert is right that double-barreled questions are methodologically weak. The split is clean.\n\n---\n\n**REVISION 4: Refine \"worked best/worst\" wording**\n**APPROVE.** \"Stayed with you / didn't fully land\" is better than \"best/worst\" for exactly the reason stated. It keeps the reader in experiential-report mode.\n\n---\n\n**REVISION 5: Request marginal notes before per-essay questions**\n**APPROVE.** The revised optional framing (\"If you made any marks or notes...\") resolves the self-consciousness concern. Pre-reflective data is indeed more reliable than retrospective report, and marginal notes captured during reading are the closest we get to real-time phenomenological data.\n\n---\n\n**REVISION 6: NO essay-specific per-essay questions**\n**APPROVE WITH AMENDMENT.**\n\nI accept the unanimous decision. The anti-contamination argument is correct and I was wrong to propose essay-specific follow-ups as a \"second pass\" within per-essay reporting. The cross-essay priming risk I underestimated is real: asking about renormalization after Essay 1 would indeed heighten attention to physics metaphors in Essay 4.\n\n**Amendment:** I want to confirm that my Part Transition question (\"You have just finished the first three essays. Before continuing, what are you expecting from the rest of the collection?\") is also excluded by this decision. If so, I accept that -- it could arguably prime the reader to expect a shift, which would partially spoil the Fish-to-Fishing experience. However, if the team considers it distinct from essay-specific questions (since it asks about expectations rather than probing a specific essay's content), I think it has value as a one-time structural check. I defer to the group on this.\n\n---\n\n**REVISION 7: Expand Critical Experiential Checks from 3 to 8**\n**APPROVE WITH TWO AMENDMENTS.**\n\n**Amendment 1 (Essay 3 wording):** The current probe says \"across the three examples.\" As I flagged in my supplementary feedback, the essay has four stages (Sisyphus, office worker, entrepreneur, cat owner). The entrepreneur is the pivot -- structurally identical labor to the office worker, but no absurdity because the meaning is internal. Imposing \"three\" may not match the reader's parsing. I recommend:\n\n> \"What happened to your experience across the examples in Essay 3?\"\n\nDropping the count makes the probe genuinely non-leading about how the reader segmented the essay.\n\n**Amendment 2 (Essay 2 wording):** The current probe says \"Essay 2 was written in English by the author. Did you notice a difference?\" This is problematic. It *tells* the reader a fact (written in English by the author) rather than testing whether they noticed it. The Translator's Preface already mentions this, so a reader who was attentive to the Preface would know. But the probe should test whether the difference was *experientially salient*, not whether the reader remembers a fact from the Preface. I recommend:\n\n> \"Did Essay 2 feel different from the other essays? In what way?\"\n\nThis lets the reader identify the difference (or not) on their own terms. If they say \"yes, it felt more formal\" or \"yes, it felt like it was written by a different person,\" we get the register-sensitivity data. If they say \"no, not really,\" that is equally valuable. Telling them it was written in English removes the diagnostic value.\n\n---\n\n**REVISION 8: Internal flag for Essay 5-6 transition**\n**APPROVE.** Good operational note. The register shift is sharp and the generic pacing questions should capture it. No action needed beyond watching for it.\n\n---\n\n**OVERALL:** I approve the plan with the two amendments on Revision 7 (drop the count from Essay 3's probe; don't reveal the English-authorship fact in Essay 2's probe) and the clarification request on Revision 6 (Part Transition question status). The architecture is sound -- generic questions during reading, targeted probes after completion, marginal notes as pre-reflective data. This is a well-synthesized plan.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"e2e09b2f-7680-403e-a2d9-e7afcad47f28","timestamp":"2026-02-11T09:22:30.403Z"}
