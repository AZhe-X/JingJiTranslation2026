*Why did you vote NO? Brief reason please*

ALL TEAM MEMBERS:

Follow-up: you all voted NO on "does this work need an introduction from others?" Please give your reason in 1-2 sentences. Why doesn't it need one?

  "content": "The essays themselves are designed as philosophical experiments — their performative structure IS the introduction. Just as a koan does not need a prefatory explanation of what koans do (and would be undermined by one), this work's method of gradually building the reader's experiential understanding from familiar examples (collective interest, cats, knowledge) toward the formal apparatus means the text introduces itself through the act of reading it. An external voice explaining \"what you are about to experience\" risks short-circuiting the very experiential sequence that is load-bearing.",
  "summary": "Reason: essays are self-introducing philosophical experiments"

Waiting for the next message from team-lead or other teammates. Ready to provide Buddhist philosophical consultation whenever needed.
