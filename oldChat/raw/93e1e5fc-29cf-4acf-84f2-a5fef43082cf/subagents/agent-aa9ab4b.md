  "content": "The work's core method is the philosophical experiment -- it constructs experiences directly in the reader and invites introspective verification. An external introduction explaining what the reader is \"about to experience\" would function like someone describing a joke before telling it: it replaces the experiential event with a proposition about it, which is precisely the confusion the author's framework diagnoses (mistaking Second Reality for First Reality). The work needs to speak for itself because its arguments are conducted in the register of experience, not doctrine.",
  "summary": "Reason: external intro would pre-empt experiential method"
