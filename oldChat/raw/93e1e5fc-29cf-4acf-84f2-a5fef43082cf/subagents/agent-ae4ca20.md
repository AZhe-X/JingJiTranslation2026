*Standard translations all use *

New data for the 德 discussion. The passage 故失道而后德，失德而后仁，失仁而后义，失义而后礼 (Dao De Jing Ch. 38) has well-established standard English translations:

**D.C. Lau**: "When the way was lost there was virtue; when virtue was lost there was benevolence; when benevolence was lost there was rectitude; when rectitude was lost there were the rites."

**Wing-tsit Chan**: "When the Way is lost, only then do we have virtue; when virtue is lost, only then do we have humanity; when humanity is lost, only then do we have righteousness; when righteousness is lost, only then do we have propriety."

**James Legge**: "When the Tao was lost, its attributes appeared; when its attributes were lost, benevolence appeared; when benevolence was lost, righteousness appeared; when righteousness was lost, the proprieties appeared."

Every major translator uses "virtue" for 德 in this passage. Our decision was "(constitutive) character" instead.

Given this data — does this change your view? Should we:
A) Keep "(constitutive) character" — our reasoned departure from tradition, acknowledged in TN
B) Use the standard "virtue" for the Laozi block quote specifically (since it IS a quotation of a classical text), then switch to "(constitutive) character" when the author begins their own analysis
C) Something else?

Brief response with your recommendation.

Voted **B** -- use standard "virtue" in the Laozi block quote, then switch to "(constitutive) character" when the author begins their own analysis. The terminological shift itself performs the author's argument: the reader sees the standard reading and then watches the author dismantle and reconstruct it.
