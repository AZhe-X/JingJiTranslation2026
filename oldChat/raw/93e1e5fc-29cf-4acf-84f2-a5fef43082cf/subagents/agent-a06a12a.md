*Romanized terms kill the philosophical experiment*

The author raises a critical point about the "philosophical experiment" argument:

If we romanize everything — Dao, De, Ren, Yi, Li — then the passage has NO English semantic content for the Western reader. The reader encounters five opaque foreign terms in a sequence. The "philosophical experiment" (where the reader first accepts a conventional understanding, then watches it get deconstructed) CANNOT work, because the reader never had a conventional understanding to begin with. The romanized terms have very few morphisms in their Jing — they are semantically empty for the English reader.

The experiment requires the reader to FEEL something when they read "virtue," "humaneness," "righteousness" — to bring their own associations — and THEN experience the reversal. If they just see "De, Ren, Yi, Li," they have nothing to reverse. The passage becomes an abstract report about foreign concepts rather than a lived philosophical experience.

Does this change your thinking? Should we use English translations (the Way, virtue, humaneness, rightness, ritual conduct) in the block quote precisely SO the philosophical experiment works on the English reader?

Reconsider. Brief response.

The philosophical experiment depends on the reader having *semantic skin in the game*.

The reader must *feel* the ground shift beneath a word they thought they understood. Romanized terms cannot produce this effect because there is no ground to shift. \"De\" is a blank token for the English reader; \"virtue\" is a loaded one.\n\nThis is not just a translation preference — it is a structural requireme

This argument fully convinced me. The philosophical experiment requires the English reader to arrive with loaded expectations — "virtue," "humaneness," "rightness" — so that the author's deconstruction has something to deconstruct. Romanized terms are semantically empty for the Western reader; the experiment cannot operate on emptiness. The reader needs to *feel* the ground shift, and that requires ground.

This also makes the virtue → (constitutive) character shift for 德 even more powerful: the reader must have felt "virtue" first to experience the force of the reconceptualization. Without that starting point, the shift is a terminological note. With it, it is a philosophical event.
