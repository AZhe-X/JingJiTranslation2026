How misleading is \"virtue\"?\n\nSignificantly misleading. The author's definition of 德 on line 24 of 后形而上学 整理 is: \"我们便把我们认为（应当是）人人皆而有之的东西...称之为'德'\" -- \"we call the things we believe everyone (ought to) possess '德'.\" And further: \"凡事诸物皆有其德（我们认为他应该遵守的规律，使得一样东西成为其本身的东西）\" -- \"all things have their 德 (the regularity we believe it should follow, the thing that makes something what it is).\"\n\nThis is not moral virtue. This is **the abstracted defining character of a kind of thing** -- what makes a person a person, what makes a dog a dog, what makes anything what it is. It is closer to Aristotle's \"essence\" or \"nature\" than to moral virtue.

The scope of the argument is metaphysical, not ethical. \"Virtue\" shrinks it to ethics.\n\n### 2. Alternatives\n\n**\"Inherent character\"** -- My first choice for this collection. It captures \"the thing that makes something what it is\" without moral connotation. It also preserves the constructivist point: we *attribute* an inherent character to things based on observed regularities, then treat it as if it were genuinely inherent. The word \"character\" has the right ambiguity between \"essential nature\" and \"attributed quality.\"\n\n**Romanized \"de\"** -- My second choice. Clean, avoids all English baggage, forces the reader to learn the concept on the author's terms. The cost is that it is opaque on first encounter and requires the reader to hold a foreign term in mind throughout.\n\n**\"Potency\"** -- Better than \"virtue\" but still off-target. \"Potency\" suggests latent power or capacity, which is closer to the Daoist sense but does not capture the author's \"that which defines what a thing is.\"\n\n**\"Nature\"** -- Tempting but risks confusion with \"human nature\" (人性) which appears separately in the essay, and with the nature/nurture distinction that is foreign to this framework.\n\n### 3. Is a TN sufficient to correct \"virtue\"?\n\n**No.** The problem with \"virtue\" is not that the reader lacks information -- a TN can supply information. The problem is that \"virtue\" activates a *frame*. When an English reader sees \"virtue,\" they enter a moral-evaluative frame that colors everything that follows. They will read \"德 generates 仁\" as \"virtue generates humaneness\" -- which sounds like a moral argument -- when the author means \"the defining character of a thing generates the specific regularities we observe in it.\" A TN can say \"this is not moral virtue,\" but the reader's frame has already been set by the word.
