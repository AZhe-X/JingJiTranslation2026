*Duplicate review, already fully processed*

This is a resend — already processed at the start of this session. Quick confirmation:

- All 8 points validated as strong, no changes needed.
- Point 6 ("summarized from"): The current draft already uses "derived from" at this location, so the concern was already resolved.
- Point 8 (canvas): Since your review, "canvas" has been changed to "paper" per the Buddhism and Wittgenstein experts' consensus on 画纸 fidelity.

No further action needed.

Noted — thanks for the update on the 画纸 → "paper" change. That makes sense for fidelity to the original. No further action on my end.
