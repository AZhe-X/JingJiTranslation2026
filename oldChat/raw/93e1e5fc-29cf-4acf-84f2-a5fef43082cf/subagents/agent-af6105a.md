*Vote: constitutive character → shortened to character*

The author proposes: introduce "constitutive character (德 De)" at first occurrence with a TN that explicitly tells the reader it will be shortened to "character" in the following paragraphs. Then use plain "character" throughout the rest of the text.

This gives:
- Precision at introduction (constitutive character)
- Lightweight running text (character)
- Reader is explicitly told about the shortening, so no confusion

YES or NO? Brief response.

Vote confirmed: **YES**. The approach is elegant -- "constitutive character (德, *De*)" at introduction with a TN explaining the shortening, then plain "character" in running text. Precision where it matters, lightness everywhere else.
