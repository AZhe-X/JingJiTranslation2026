*Debate: righteousness vs rightness for 义*

Debate request: "righteousness" vs "rightness" for 义 (yi).

Current dictionary: "rightness" (main), based on Chinese-phil-expert's recommendation that "righteousness is too moralistic."

The author treats 义 as the motivational bridge between inner feeling (仁) and outward action (礼) — a 推动力 (driving force). Not purely moral judgment but the impulse that moves you from feeling to action.

Standard Laozi translations use "righteousness" (Chan, Ivanhoe) or "rectitude" (Lau).

We just established that the block quote needs English words with semantic weight — words the reader FEELS — so the philosophical experiment works. "Righteousness" carries heavy moral-religious associations in English (biblical righteousness, self-righteousness, righteous anger). "Rightness" is lighter, more neutral, closer to "correctness."

Question: Which serves the translation better?
- "Righteousness" — more loaded, more to deconstruct, standard in Laozi translations
- "Rightness" — less moralistic, closer to the author's usage as motivational bridge rather than moral judgment

Debate. Brief responses.

Yes, we need words the reader *feels* -- but the experiment fails if the reader feels the *wrong thing* and then the deconstruction does not match what was felt.\n\nThe author's analysis of 义 is specific: 义 is the 推动力 (motivational force) that connects inner feeling to outward action. \"This feeling makes me want to act in a certain way.\" That is *rightness* -- a sense that something is the right thing to do, a felt appropriateness. It is not *righteousness* -- a cosmic moral judgment, a claim to divine or absolute moral standing.\n\nIf the reader loads \"righteousness\" (b
