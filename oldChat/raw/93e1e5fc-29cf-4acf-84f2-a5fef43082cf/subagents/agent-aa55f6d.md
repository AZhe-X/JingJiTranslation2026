*Load 8+1 essays and your report before feedback*

Reminder: Make sure you have loaded the 8+1 source essays and your own Analysis Report into your context before submitting feedback on the Reporting Protocol. You need the essay content fresh in mind to judge what essay-specific questions would be appropriate (and whether they risk priming the reader).

Source essays:

2. Essay 1: `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/22 随笔/关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一.md`
3. Essay 2: `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/23 Reflection/A Thought on Knowledge.md`

The team lead is asking me to reload the source essays and my analysis report before giving feedback on the Reporting Protocol. However, I've already sent my feedback to the translator. Let me check — the team lead says "before submitting feedback." I already submitted it. But the point is valid: I should have the essay content fresh to judge essay-specific questions properly. Let me reload the essays now so I can provide any follow-up or corrections if needed based on the actual essay content rather than just my memo notes.

Let me read the essays and my analysis report. I'll start with the essays I have detailed notes on but haven't re-read this session.

Good, now I have all 8 essays fresh in context. Let me also check if I have an Analysis Report in my workspace (the team lead mentioned it).

[tool: Glob]
{
  "pattern": "**/Analysis Report*",
  "path": "/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace"
}

I don't have my own Analysis Report — the team lead may have been referring to my workspace in a general sense, or perhaps my "report" is effectively the Memo.md I've been building. The Analysis Reports in those directories belong to the 9 domain experts. I've already incorporated their insights into my Memo.

Now, having re-read all 8 essays fresh, let me assess whether my earlier feedback to the translator needs any corrections or supplements. Let me think through what I noticed on this re-read that's relevant to the Reporting Protocol:

1. **Essay 1** — The renormalization metaphor is extended and repeated (water molecules/ocean waves, atoms/DNA/cells/hair). The reader's experience of this analogy is important. But I also notice something I missed: the essay ends with a nearly lyrical flourish about sweeping away the "虚无感" (sense of void) around abstract concepts. That's a significant experiential moment.

2. **Essay 3** — Re-reading confirmed: the three-case sequence (Sisyphus -> office worker -> cat) is absolutely the load-bearing structure. The cat passage is particularly vivid — "没有一个养猫的人会感到荒谬，荒谬从未来过" ("no cat owner has ever felt absurd, absurdity never came"). The reader's self-recognition here is the philosophical payload.

3. **Essay 5** — The dreamscape concept is introduced via a gaming analogy (RPG/sandbox). This is actually a very accessible entry point. The reader's experience of whether this analogy clicks is important.

4. **Essay 6** — The magic book examples (猫猫变鼠鼠) are written in a deliberately playful, childlike register. This register shift — from philosophical argument to whimsical storytelling — is itself noteworthy. Also, the Ship of Theseus discussion and the "what is a person?" example are key experiential moments.

5. **Essay 7** — The meme sentence ("你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国，记住我给出的原理") is a critical experiential moment. Also, the "1+1=2" passage and the "cat jumped on the table" example are both designed to produce specific experiential effects. The η (eta) as "direct confirmation feeling" when understanding aligns is a key moment.

6. **Appendix** — The coin-flip and answer-book examples of poiesis are compact and experientially vivid. The long passage about how we already construct jing in everyday life (arranging a desk, choosing clothes, pressing the shutter at sunset) is near-lyrical and could be a high point of the reading experience.

Let me send a supplementary message to the translator with essay-specific observations now that I've re-read everything.

Now let me also notify the team lead that I've completed the re-read and sent supplementary feedback.

  "type": "message",

Supplementary feedback sent to the translator, and confirmation sent to the team lead. Summary of what I've done:

**Initial feedback (7 recommendations):**
1. Add baseline-expectation question after Preface
2. Defer "experience vs. argument" question to Part 2 only
3. Split engagement/pacing question into two
4. Refine "worked best/worst" to "stayed with you / didn't land"
5. Request marginal notes alongside per-essay reports
6. Add Essay 6 probe to Critical Experiential Checks
7. Reject essay-specific per-essay questions; expand Critical Experiential Checks instead

**Supplementary feedback after re-reading all 8 essays (2 modifications + 1 flag):**
- Revised Essay 6 probe to include the magic book register shift alongside Ship of Theseus
- Added Appendix probe for coin-flip and everyday-jing passages
- Flagged the Essay 5 to Essay 6 transition as the sharpest register shift in the collection — a potential momentum-loss point

Also noted that the Essay 7 contrasting-sentences probe should not name the sentences — whether the reader can recall them from memory is itself diagnostic.

Now idle and awaiting the next task or the translator's response to my feedback.
