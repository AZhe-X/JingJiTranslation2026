*Two optional follow-ups: intersubjectivity via η, essays as philosophical experiments*

Two follow-up items from the author for you to consider. These are optional — only engage if you find them relevant to your field. If not, you can skip.

1. **Intersubjectivity (主体间性)**: If you have open questions about how intersubjectivity works in this framework, the author suggests looking at the natural transformation (自然变换) section in K1策略. The natural transformation η may be the mechanism through which intersubjective verification is possible — if two people share the same structural alignment (same η), their understanding is commensurable even without sharing qualia. Consider whether this resolves or reframes the intersubjectivity problem from your field's perspective.

2. **Philosophical Experiment (哲学实验)**: The author proposes "philosophical experiments" — constructing examples to awaken specific experiences in readers, then checking if those experiences are replicable. The author suggests that many parts of the essays THEMSELVES are philosophical experiments (not just descriptions of philosophy, but actual experiments being conducted on the reader). Re-read the essays with this lens: which specific passages function as philosophical experiments? Is the Sisyphus/cat essay itself an experiment in dissolving absurdity? Is the 道德仁义礼 reversal an experiment in restructuring the reader's 境?

If you have thoughts on either of these, please share. If not, no need to respond.

These are both directly relevant to philosophy of mind. Let me think through them carefully.

My analysis on both follow-up topics has been sent. I addressed:

1. **Intersubjectivity via eta** -- argued it productively reframes the problem by replacing "do we share qualia?" with "do we share eta-structure?", connecting it to Zahavi, Gallese, and Brandom as special cases, and noting the translation implication for 主体间性.

2. **Essays as philosophical experiments** -- identified 6 specific passages functioning as experiments (the cat essay's three-condition absurdity dissolution, the 道德仁义礼 reversal, the 1+1 eta experience, the game analogy for naturality, the cat-on-table vs. meme contrast, and the collective interest rescaling), and characterized the methodology as a novel synthesis of Husserlian eidetic variation, analytic thought experiments, and contemplative targeting.

Standing by for further requests.
