I agree with all your reasoning on the declined items. In particular:\n\n- The scare quotes point is well taken. Telegraphing the reversal would undermine the philosophical experiment. The reader needs to inhabit the received view before it collapses.\n- You are right that \"constitutes\" imports Kantian vocabulary into a translation apparatus that should remain tradition-neutral. The parallel is there for a scholar to notice, but the TN should not push the reader toward one philosophical framework.\n\nNo further comments from my end. The draft is in good shape.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"43dccbb9-c44e-460d-be4a-ab7cf1f40551","timestamp":"2026-02-11T03:40:13.186Z"}
