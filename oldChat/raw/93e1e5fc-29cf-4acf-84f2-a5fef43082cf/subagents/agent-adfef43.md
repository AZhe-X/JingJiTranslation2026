*Compare author's Poetic vs Heidegger's poetic dwelling*

The author (team lead) would like your expert commentary on the difference between the author's concept of 诗意 (the Poetic) and Heidegger's concept of poetic dwelling / Dichtung. How do they differ? Where do they converge? What is distinctive about the author's position compared to Heidegger's?

I just provided this analysis in my response to the user. Let me send it to the team lead as well.

Sent the full comparative analysis to the team lead. The core argument: the author's 诗意 and Heidegger's poetic dwelling converge on a non-instrumental relationship to meaning after metaphysics, but they arrive there from structurally incompatible starting points — Heidegger from ontological disclosure (Being shows itself through language), the author from phenomenological construction (the subject builds meaning-structures upon phenomena). Three key differences: disclosure vs. construction, language-privileged vs. medium-neutral, and no lucidity condition vs. lucidity as constitutive. Three distinctive features of the author's position: livability, formal rigor, and unambiguous post-nihilistic orientation.

Waiting for further instructions.
