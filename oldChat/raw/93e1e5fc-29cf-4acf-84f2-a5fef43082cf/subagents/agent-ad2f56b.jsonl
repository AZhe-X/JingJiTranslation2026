Would a philosophy of language expert materially help the NON-category-theory essays?**\n\nNo, not materially. The non-category-theory essays do not engage with philosophy of language as a discipline. They use language as a medium of philosophical expression, but they do not make claims *about* language that would require specialized expertise. Specifically:\n\n- 后形而上学: The discussion of 道德仁义礼 involves conceptual analysis and metaphysical construction, not philosophy of language. The key challenge is metaphysics and Chinese philosophy, both of which we have covered.\n- 诗意: The concept of 梦境 and 诗意 are about experiential frames and meaning-making, not about language per se. The challenges here are phenomenological and existential.\n- 西西弗斯、班与猫: This is straightforwardly existentialist/absurdist. No philosophy of language issues.\n- 集体利益: This uses the renormalization analogy from physics. The challenge is getting the physics metaphor right, not philosophy of language.\n- A Thought on Knowledge: This is pure epistemology. The author's analysis of belief, justification, and truth does not engage with speech act theory, reference, or meaning in the philosophy-of-language sense.\n- 零散想法: The meme examples (\"你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国...\") touch on meaning and comprehension, but only as *illustrations* of the natural transformation framework from K1策略. Outside the K1 context, they require cultural knowledge more than philosophy of language expertise.\n\n**2. Is the philosophy of language need concentrated in K1策略?**\n\nYes, almost entirely. The K1策略 essay is where the substantive philosophy-of-language claims appear:\n\n- The natural transformation model of understanding (section on 自然变换) makes a direct claim about the relationship between linguistic structure and cognitive processing. This engages with debates about compositionality, the syntax-semantics interface, and embodied meaning.\n- The passage about \"结构先于意义，还是意义先于结构\" (does structure precede meaning or meaning precede structure?) directly addresses a core philosophy of language debate.\n- The language game methodology (语言游戏) invokes Wittgenstein, though the author's use is closer to \"using language as an experimental probe\" than to Wittgenstein's original therapeutic use.\n\nAll of these could be handled alongside the category theory expert, since the philosophy-of-language content in K1策略 is inseparable from the category-theoretic formalism.\n\n**3. What in my field's overlap with philosophy of language can I NOT adequately cover?**\n\nI can cover:\n- The cognitive science of language comprehension (embodied simulation, spreading activation, psycholinguistic models of sentence processing)\n- The relationship between the natural transformation model and theories of understanding in cognitive science\n- Translation of 联想 (association) as it functions in cognitive architecture\n\nI cannot adequately cover:\n- The precise relationship between the author's \"structure vs. meaning\" claim and the formal semantics tradition (Montague grammar, type-theoretic semantics). If the translator wants to position the natural transformation model relative to, say, Montague's compositionality principle, that requires a philosophy of language specialist.\n- Whether the author's implicit use of \"语言游戏\" aligns with or diverges from Wittgenstein's specific notion in the Philosophical Investigations. I can recognize the reference but cannot provide the fine-grained Wittgenstein scholarship needed to decide whether to translate it as \"language game\" (with Wittgensteinian connotations) or to use a more neutral term.\n\nHowever, these are relatively narrow concerns and would only matter for specific passages in K1策略. I do not think they justify adding a full expert to the team for the non-category-theory essays.\n\n**Bottom line:** A philosophy of language expert is not needed for the non-technical essays.
