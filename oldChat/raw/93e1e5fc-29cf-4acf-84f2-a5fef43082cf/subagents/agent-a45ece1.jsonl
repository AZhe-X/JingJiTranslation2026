The argument that listing them in the Preface pre-loads attention beyond what the table of contents does is fair — there is a difference between seeing \"Sisyphus, Work, and Cats\" as a title and seeing the three cases laid out as a deliberate mythic-to-mundane gradient. I withdraw my amendment.\n\n**The minor flag:** Edit 3's final text still contains \"lived experience\": \"the reader is invited to test the essay's claim against their own lived experience.\" Per the Translation Dictionary, we established \"AVOID 'lived experience' — too Husserlian.\" This is a small fix — suggest replacing with \"the reader is invited to test the essay's claim against their own experience\" (simply dropping \"lived\"). The word \"experience\" alone is sufficient here; the reader is not going to confuse it with detached observation in this context.\n\nEverything else — Edits 1, 2, 4, 5, the full Afterword blueprint including all expert-contributed additions, placement, tone, length, structure, and process — I agree without reservation. The Afterword blueprint is thorough and well-structured. The closing gesture (returning the reader to their own experience, echoing the Appendix) is exactly right.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"b271b272-7df6-4dfc-b660-b6c127e604c7","timestamp":"2026-02-11T07:53:40.090Z"}
