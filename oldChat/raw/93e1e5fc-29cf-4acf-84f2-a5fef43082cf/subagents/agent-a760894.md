*Stand by — no new proposals*

Stand by means stand by. Do NOT circulate new proposals or solicit votes. 

Decision on your two items:
(A) The retrospective question — already approved, add it when I tell you to proceed.
(B) Essay-specific follow-ups — NO. The unanimous decision stands. Do not reopen.

Go idle now.
