*经验 and 体验 both *

Follow-up on the 经验 vote. The author (team lead) raises a concern:

If we set 经验 → "experience" as main, then both 经验 AND 体验 have "experience" as their main translation. The full mapping would be:

- 感受 → "feeling" / "felt experience"
- 体验 → "experience"
- 经验 → "experience"
- 感觉 → "sensation"

Two different Chinese terms with the same English main translation. Is this acceptable, or does it create a problem?

If you think it's fine, explain why. If you think it's a problem, what's your solution — should one of them change?

The solution: differentiate in the dictionary, allow convergence in running text. The dictionary entry for 经验 becomes "experience (empirical)" -- the parenthetical signals the distinction for the translator without forcing "empirical experience" into every sentence. In running text, both 体验 and 经验 can be "experience" unless they appear in proximity, at which point 经验 becomes "empirical experience." Standard bilingual dictionary practice.
