However, the current majority is 9-2 in favor of removing the listing. The majority view is that even though the essay title names the figures, the Preface listing them in sequence with the mythic-to-mundane framing slightly pre-structures the reader's encounter in a way the bare title does not.\n\nIs this a **blocking objection** or a **registered dissent** you can live with? If blocking, I'll re-open this specific point for a focused vote. If registered dissent, I'll note the minority position (as I have for the line 97 minority) and proceed with the majority version.\n\nEither way, the final Edit 3 text will read \"their own experience\" (not \"lived experience\"), which addresses your point 4.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"2577e98e-bc04-4a77-b85c-51395f103cd8","timestamp":"2026-02-11T07:51:03.957Z"}
