Your point on probe 5 is interesting and converges with phil-mind-expert's note from a different angle: phil-mind suggested shifting the wording from conceptual to experiential (\"What was your experience of the dreamscape idea?\"), and you're suggesting going even more open-ended (\"What stayed with you from Essay 5?\"). Both are worth considering when the document reaches me for editing. I'll track both suggestions.
