*Read translator's Memo and add notes*

For your reference, you can also read the translator's memo at:
/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Memo.md

Read it and add any relevant notes to your own Memo.md. Focus on editorial-relevant insights — translation approach, glossary decisions, register strategy, structural principles, anything that affects how you'll edit the drafts.
