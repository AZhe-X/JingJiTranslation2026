*Vote yes/no on statement about needing external intro*

ALL TEAM MEMBERS:

Vote YES or NO on this statement (this is a philosophical judgment, not a decision about the book):

**"Whether or not to have a Foreword, a key judgment is: does this work need an introduction from others?"**

Vote YES if you agree with the statement.
Vote NO if you disagree.

One word is fine. No reasons needed.

Voted NO. The work speaks for itself and the Translator's Preface provides sufficient orientation. Awaiting next task.
