Let us call the **actual** behavior in phenomena \"phenomenal ritual conduct.\" I have an **explanation** for phenomenal ritual conduct: it is the feeling that arises from within the heart when I am with another person — a feeling directed toward the other. This feeling is something I **actually** feel, and is therefore part of phenomena; I call it \"phenomenal humaneness.\" This feeling moves me to want to treat the other person in such-and-such a way; this driving force (*motivation*) is also something I **actually** feel, and so I call it \"phenomenal rightness.\"[^3] Phenomenal ritual conduct exists not only in how I treat others, but also in how other people treat one another. We therefore extend phenomenal humaneness and phenomenal rightness as our **explanation** of phenomenal ritual conduct more broadly. That is to say: because phenomenal ritual conduct (apparently) is exhibited in everyone around us, and because we interpret phenomenal ritual conduct as \"phenomenal humaneness generates phenomenal rightness, which in turn generates phenomenal ritual conduct,\" we conclude that everyone who practices phenomenal ritual conduct (ought to) possess this phenomenal humaneness.[^4]\n    39→\n    40→Next, we take what we believe (ought to be) universally possessed — here, phenomenal humaneness — and call it \"character\" (德).[^TN3] And why should there be such a universal regularity? Because of \"the Way.\"[^24]\n    41→\n    42→We can now see that, at the level of phenomena, humaneness and rightness are merely an *explanation* of ritual conduct. As for what we observe of external phenomena, in fact we have only seen the phenomenal ritual conduct within phenomena, and from it we **infer** phenomenal rightness, and from phenomenal rightness we **infer** phenomenal humaneness — even though **no** actual phenomenal rightness or phenomenal humaneness appears in *my* phenomena, because the feeling that arises from within the heart and the driving force are only what **I** feel when **I** practice phenomenal ritual conduct. I cannot truly feel **another person's** inner feelings; I have merely **imposed** my explanation of \"**my own** phenomenal ritual conduct\" onto the phenomenal ritual conduct we observe **others** performing. Therefore, the humaneness and rightness in other people are in fact *generated from* the phenomenal ritual conduct in phenomena. But in our interpretation, we take it to be the reverse: humaneness generates rightness, and from rightness one practices ritual conduct — as though phenomenal ritual conduct were generated *by* humaneness and rightness.\n    43→\n    44→Next, on the basis of this generated humaneness and rightness, we conclude: \"all people possess humaneness.\" But in fact it is: \"all people (**can**) possess humaneness,\" since we discovered from many people who exhibit humaneness that many people have it — humaneness is thus an inductively derived **property**. Yet our final understanding becomes: \"all people (**should**) possess humaneness\" — or rather, \"only those who possess humaneness count as human.\" And so a **property** that a person can have — here, humaneness — is transformed into a **definition** of personhood. These definitions, taken together, define **what a person is** — that is, \"character\": that which makes a person a person.[^TN4] We thus see that character, too, is in fact generated from humaneness — yet in our understanding we take it to be the reverse: *because* you are a person, *therefore* you must possess humaneness. Finally, character is a general regularity, because all things have their character (the pattern we take them to follow, that which makes a thing what it is), and so we gather all instances of character together, inductively abstract from them, and arrive at \"the Way.\" The Way, then, is in fact generated from character — yet we understand it as the Way generating character.\n    45→\n    46→Thus the entire logical order is reversed. The Way generates character; the character of a person is humaneness; from humaneness arises rightness; from rightness one practices ritual conduct. But this final \"ritual conduct\" is no longer the original phenomenal ritual conduct, because the logic by which phenomenal ritual conduct generated \"the Way\" has been **buried from view** — it has been entirely **lost**. People take the Way to be the most primordial *meta-physics*. And so the ritual conduct that is finally generated is now merely a norm, and not necessarily the original phenomenal ritual conduct that (in the explanation) arose from within the heart.\n    47→\n    48→In practice, this loss continues cascading downward, level after level — pursuing the branches and forgetting the root.

And yet we cannot help but rely on some framework to describe phenomena; thus even though I have tried my utmost to restore their original phenomenal character, the account remains imprecise. In Chinese philosophy, humaneness and rightness are often mentioned together. Humaneness (仁) is said to be *loving others*; rightness (义) is said to be *what ought to be*. In the conventional understanding — to take loving one's father as an example of humaneness — what I *ought to do* out of love for my father is rightness. And the concrete behavior that fulfills this rightness is ritual conduct. Rightness is thus the thing that connects humaneness to concrete action (ritual conduct). At the phenomenal level, I use \"phenomenal humaneness\" to describe the inner feeling (of love) I have toward my father — a feeling that impels me to act in certain ways. This driving force, this \"motivation\" itself, is what connects my feeling (phenomenal humaneness) to my behavior (phenomenal ritual conduct), and so it is fitting to call it phenomenal rightness.\n    55→\n    56→[^4]: The phenomenal humaneness and phenomenal rightness thus extended to others are no longer within *my* phenomena.\n    57→\n    58→[^24]: A note of caution: the interpretation of \"the Way\" (道) more faithful to Daoist thought would be closer to *that which enables existence to stand* — pictorially, something like the paper on which a painting is made.
