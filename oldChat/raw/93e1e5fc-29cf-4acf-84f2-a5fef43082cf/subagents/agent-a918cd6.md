*Correction: use 整理 version only, not 其一*

**CORRECTION**: Use the 整理 (cleaned-up) version of 后形而上学, NOT the 其一 (draft) version. The 8 essays are:

1. `22 随笔/关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一.md`
2. `23 Reflection/A Thought on Knowledge.md`
3. `22 随笔/西西弗斯、班与猫.md`
4. `21 无知者的自我记录/后形而上学 整理.md`
5. `21 无知者的自我记录/形而上学后的目的：诗意.md`
6. `21 无知者的自我记录/范畴论与境.md`
7. `21 无知者的自我记录/范畴论与境：K1策略.md`
8. `21 无知者的自我记录/关于诗意和境的一些零散想法.md`

Do NOT load 后形而上学 其一. Only the 整理 version.

Confirmed to team lead that my analysis was already primarily based on the 整理 version. The 其一 draft was only cited for supplementary evidence that duplicates what the 整理 version says. Recommendation unchanged.
