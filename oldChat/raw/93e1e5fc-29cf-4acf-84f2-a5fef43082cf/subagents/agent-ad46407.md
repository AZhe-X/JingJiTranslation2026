*Check 境界 occurrences in source texts — traditional or technical?*

Follow-up question from the author on 境界: Since 境界 also contains 境, we need to check whether the -scape link should apply here too, or whether 境界 is used in its traditional sense (boundary/realm/level of attainment).

Could you check where 境界 actually appears in the original essays and assess: is the author using 境界 in a way that connects to the technical concept 境, or in its traditional/conventional sense? Does the 境 inside 境界 matter the same way the 境 inside 梦境 matters?

The source texts are at:

/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/22 随笔/

Please check the actual occurrences and give your assessment. Brief responses welcome.

Let me read the full context of the occurrences, particularly the omitted long lines.

Sent my assessment. Key findings:

- **境界** appears only in the opening section of "范畴论与境 整理," used in its traditional sense of "boundary/realm/scope" (the author explicitly glosses it as 界限).
- It is NOT the technical concept 境 (E). The -scape link should NOT apply.
- However, line 25 is where the transition happens: the author writes 境界 then immediately switches to 境 alone ("明日之境不同于今日之境") -- this is the birth moment of the technical concept emerging from the traditional usage.
- The relationship is genealogical (境 emerges from 境界 by dropping 界), not compositional (unlike 梦境 which contains 境).
- I recommend rendering 境界 as **"horizon"** (Husserlian resonance: a shifting frontier of what can be intended) and adding a translator's note at line 25 where the concept is born.

Standing by.
