A few brief notes from the epistemological perspective, none rising to the level of AMEND:\n\n1. **Edit 2 (line 50 replacement):** The proposed replacement is exactly right. \"The relationship between the two parts is itself part of the argument\" is a masterful closing sentence -- it tells the reader to pay attention to the Fish/Fishing structure without explaining what they will find. This is topic-level orientation at its best.\n\n2. **Edit 3 (lines 95-96):** The phrase \"the reader is invited to test the essay's claim against their own lived experience\" is well-crafted. It signals the experiential method without naming the specific experience. One minor observation: \"lived experience\" appears here despite our dictionary convention avoiding the Husserlian overtones of that phrase. In context, I think it works -- the Preface is not using it as a technical term but in its ordinary English sense. Not a blocking concern.\n\n3. **Afterword Section B (Cross-Traditional Connections):** When drafting the epistemological content for this section, I would recommend emphasizing the access argument as the linchpin that connects the epistemological essay (Essay 2) to the formal apparatus (Essays 6-7). The access argument is what makes the move from JTB-collapse to the categorical framework *necessary* rather than merely interesting: if all justification reduces to belief, then we need a structural account of how beliefs organize themselves, which is exactly what the K1 strategy provides. The intersubjectivity resolution via eta should also receive prominent treatment here -- it is among the collection's most significant philosophical contributions and will be new to readers familiar with standard approaches.\n\n4. **Afterword Section E (What Remains Open):** The mention of the KA conjecture is important. From an epistemological standpoint, the most significant open question is whether $S_K$ can be concretely characterized -- the framework is currently promissory on this point, and honest acknowledgment strengthens rather than weakens the collection's credibility.\n\n5. **Overall structure:** The Afterword blueprint follows the collection's own epistemological logic perfectly: first state what the reader experienced (Section A), then connect it to existing knowledge structures (Section B), then reflect on the method (Section C), then address the medium (Section D), then identify structural gaps (Section E). This is itself a kind of categorical construction -- building from phenomena to the metaphysical.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"bba66676-09d6-45d0-823f-829d28684257","timestamp":"2026-02-11T07:49:57.386Z"}
