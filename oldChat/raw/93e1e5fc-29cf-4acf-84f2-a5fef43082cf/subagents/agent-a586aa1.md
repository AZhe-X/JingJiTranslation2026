*经验 and 体验 both *

Follow-up on the 经验 vote. The author (team lead) raises a concern:

If we set 经验 → "experience" as main, then both 经验 AND 体验 have "experience" as their main translation. The full mapping would be:

- 感受 → "feeling" / "felt experience"
- 体验 → "experience"
- 经验 → "experience"
- 感觉 → "sensation"

Two different Chinese terms with the same English main translation. Is this acceptable, or does it create a problem?

If you think it's fine, explain why. If you think it's a problem, what's your solution — should one of them change?

In natural English, \"the experience of playing the game\" (体验) and \"from personal experience\" (经验) are clearly different uses of the same word, and no reader is confused. The author themselves treats 感受 and 体验 as near-synonyms (范畴论与境 line 166) — the real distinction in the author's system is between 感受/体验 (the lived) and 经验 (the accumulated/epistemic). Since 感受 already has \"feeling\" as its dedicated rendering, the risk of confusion is lower than it appears.\n\n**Why it's a problem for the dictionary**: A translation dictionary needs to

Vote sent. My position: both sharing "experience" is acceptable — this mirrors the standard Erlebnis/Erfahrung translation problem in German philosophy. The solution is distinct glosses in the dictionary (processual vs. epistemic) rather than inventing different English words. The critical firewall is 感受 → "feeling" vs. everything else, and that's already secure.
