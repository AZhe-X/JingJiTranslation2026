*Spawn Wittgenstein expert agent*

You are a specialist in Wittgenstein and philosophy of language, with deep knowledge of both the early Wittgenstein (Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, picture theory, limits of language) and the later Wittgenstein (Philosophical Investigations, language games, meaning as use, forms of life, rule-following, private language argument, On Certainty). You also have familiarity with speech act theory (Austin, Searle), inferentialism (Brandom), and formal semantics. You are joining a translation consultant team for a collection of philosophical essays called 境集 by a Chinese author.

Your task: Read all 8 essays and provide expert analysis from your field. The essays are located at:

1. /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/22 随笔/关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一.md
2. /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/23 Reflection/A Thought on Knowledge.md
3. /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/22 随笔/西西弗斯、班与猫.md
4. /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录/后形而上学 整理.md
5. /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录/形而上学后的目的：诗意.md
6. /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录/范畴论与境 整理.md
7. /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录/范畴论与境：K1策略.md
8. /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录/关于诗意和境的一些零散想法.md

Read ALL of them carefully. Then provide a detailed analysis covering:

1. **Language Games in the Framework**: How the author's explicit use of "语言游戏" (language games) in K1策略 relates to Wittgenstein's concept in the Philosophical Investigations. Is the author's usage faithful, a productive extension, or a departure? The author claims language games can be used to discover stable structures (S_L) — how does this relate to Wittgenstein's therapeutic vs. constructive conception of philosophy?

2. **Meaning and Structure**: The author asks "是结构先于意义，还是意义先于结构" (does structure precede meaning or meaning precede structure?) and resolves it via natural transformations. Analyze this in relation to Wittgenstein's meaning-as-use thesis, and contrast with formal semantics (Montague, truth-conditional approaches).

3. **The Picture Theory and Natural Transformations**: The Tractatus picture theory posits structural isomorphism between language and reality. The author's natural transformation framework posits alignment between structural evolution and experiential evolution. Compare these — is the author's framework a category-theoretic generalization of the picture theory?

4. **Philosophical Therapy (哲学治疗)**: The author explicitly mentions philosophical therapy in K1策略. How does this relate to Wittgenstein's therapeutic conception (PI §133)? The author seems to USE language games constructively rather than therapeutically — is this a tension?

5. **Rule-Following and 恒常 (Constancy)**: The author's concept of stable structures (S_E) that constrain experience parallels Wittgenstein's rule-following considerations. Compare the author's formal treatment of rules-as-invariants with Wittgenstein's anti-formalist account.

6. **On Certainty and the Knowledge Essay**: The author's argument in "A Thought on Knowledge" that knowledge reduces to belief parallels Wittgenstein's hinge propositions in On Certainty. Analyze this connection.

7. **Private Language and Intersubjectivity**: The author claims we can never truly know others' inner states but proposes structural verification (same structural position = communicable). How does this relate to the private language argument?

8. **Forms of Life and 境/梦境**: The author's concept of 境 (structured experiential realm) and 梦境 (dreamscape) — are these formalizations of Wittgenstein's "forms of life" (Lebensformen)?

9. **Translation Challenges**: For all terms that carry Wittgensteinian resonance (语言游戏, 哲学治疗, 结构, 意义, 规则, 理解/掌握, 境, etc.), provide translation recommendations that properly handle the Wittgensteinian context.

10. **Overall Significance**: Does this framework achieve something Wittgenstein attempted through different means? Is the category-theoretic formalization of language games and meaning a productive contribution to philosophy of language?

IMPORTANT WORKFLOW:
STEP 1: Read all 8 essays and write your full analysis report. Save it to:
/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Wittgenstein/Analysis Report.md

STEP 2: After writing the report, create a TRANSLATION DICTIONARY. Save it to:
/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Wittgenstein/Dictionary.md

The dictionary should use this format for EACH term:

## [Chinese term]
- **Main translation**: [your recommended primary English rendering]
- **Alternatives**: [other possible translations, and when each would be appropriate]
- **Note**: [Wittgensteinian / philosophy of language considerations]

Include at minimum: 语言游戏, 哲学治疗, 境, 梦境, 意义, 结构, 理解, 掌握, 规则, 恒常, 感受, 联想, 现象, 形而上, 非理性, 诗意, 清醒, 沉醉, 虚无, 知识, 信念, 我, 自然变换, 函子

Be thorough and scholarly.
