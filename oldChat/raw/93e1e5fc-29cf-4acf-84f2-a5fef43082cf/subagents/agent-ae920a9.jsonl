To confirm you have it, the key points were:\n\n1. Do NOT add essay-specific questions to per-essay template (cross-essay priming risk)\n2. Add Critical Experiential Checks for Essay 1 (physics analogy test) and Essay 5 (Poetic/dreamscape distinction)\n3. Soften question 4 in per-essay template: change \"Did you feel like the essay was asking you to *experience* something...\" to \"What was the essay asking you to do — understand an argument, experience something, or both? Did it succeed?\"\n4. Deliver Critical Checks sequentially (one at a time), not simultaneously\n5. Confirmed \"tell a friend\" prompts as excellent\n\nLet me know if you need anything else.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"2670d269-6c2b-4247-8148-0bdfb49340fa","timestamp":"2026-02-11T09:20:35.009Z"}
