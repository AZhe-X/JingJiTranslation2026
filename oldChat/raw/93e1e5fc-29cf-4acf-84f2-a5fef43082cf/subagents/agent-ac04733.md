  "content": "The collection is deliberately self-grounding — it begins with concrete philosophical experiences (Fish) and only then reveals the formal apparatus behind them (Fishing), enacting the very epistemological principle it argues for: that understanding must be built from phenomena upward, not imposed from authority downward. Having an external scholar introduce and frame the work before the reader encounters it would structurally contradict this principle by providing a top-down interpretive lens before the reader has the phenomenal ground to evaluate it.",
  "summary": "Reason: work is self-grounding, external framing contradicts its method"
