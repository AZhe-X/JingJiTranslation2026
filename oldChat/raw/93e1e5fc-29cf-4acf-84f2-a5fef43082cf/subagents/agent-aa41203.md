*Review proposed translator profile*

DISCUSSION: Proposed profile for the dedicated philosophical translator agent. Please review and respond with whether you AGREE, or if you want to ADD, CHANGE, or REMOVE anything.

Proposed profile:
1. Native-level command of both Chinese and English
2. Philosophical training (not purely literary)
3. Literary sensibility (not purely academic)
4. Category theory / mathematical notation literacy
5. Experience with register shifts (colloquial ↔ technical ↔ poetic)
6. Translator models: Burton Watson, A.C. Graham, Brook Ziporyn

Please respond with:
- AGREE (if you're satisfied with the profile as-is)
- Or specific additions/changes/removals with justification

This is discussion time -- if you disagree with another expert's suggestion, say so. We want consensus before proceeding.

A literary translator preserves beauty; what we need here is a translator who understands that the *argumentative sequence itself* is doing experiential work on the reader, and who can reproduce that effect in English.\n\nThis is not covered by \"literary sensib

Sent my review. Key contributions: proposed adding (1) sensitivity to performative philosophical writing as a distinct requirement beyond literary sensibility, and (2) explicit Kantian terminological familiarity. Also suggested Husserl translators (Moran, Carr) as additional models for the technical essays, complementing the classical Chinese translation models already listed. Standing by.
