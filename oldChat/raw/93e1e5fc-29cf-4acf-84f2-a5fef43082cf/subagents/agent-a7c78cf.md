It appears I've received a task assignment notification for task #3, which I have already completed. I read all 8 essays, performed a thorough epistemological analysis covering all requested dimensions, sent the detailed analysis to the team lead, and marked task #3 as completed.

Let me check if there are any other available tasks I should pick up.

Task #3 is already marked completed. There is one pending task (#15 - Buddhism/Madhyamaka/Zen expert analysis), but that falls outside my epistemology specialization and has no owner yet. All other tasks are either completed or in progress with assigned owners.

My work is done. The comprehensive epistemology analysis has been delivered to the team lead.
