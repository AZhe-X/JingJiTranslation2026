Here is the status of your 3 main suggestions:\n\n1. **Hyphenated \"*meta-physics*\" for 元物理** — Already in the draft. Line 36 reads: `the most \"primordial\" *meta-physics* (元物理)`. This was done in an earlier pass.\n\n2. **\"(德)\" after \"character\" at first analysis appearance** — Already in the draft. Line 40 reads: `and call it \"character\" (德).[^TN3]`. The callback is present.\n\n3. **Scare quotes on \"generates\"** — Not adopting. The original 道生万物 has no scare quotes or emphasis on 生. The author's rhetorical strategy is to present the conventional view *straight* and then deconstruct it — the reader needs to first accept the top-down picture before the reversal hits. Scare-quoting would editorially front-load the deconstruction. The later italicized \"*generated*\" in the same sentence already marks the emphasis at the right moment.\n\nYour confirmations on the constructivist inversion, TN3, TN4, and the phenomenal-X consistency are all helpful validation. The \"righteousness\" point is noted and deferred per the team vote.\n\nNo changes needed from your review — the draft already incorporates your first two suggestions.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"9c93289b-9b0d-40bf-a5a9-f5cfc38ef3c4","timestamp":"2026-02-11T03:39:08.042Z"}
