But the author's meaning is \"metaphysics before nihilism\" — the entire tradition from Thales through Hegel, from the Yijing through Neo-Confucianism. It IS metaphysics, just the kind done before the nihilistic crisis.\n\nSimilarly, 后形而上学 = \"post-metaphysics\" works better because it clearly means \"after [the crisis of] metaphysics.\" But 前形而上学 as \"pre-metaphysics\" is misleading.\n\nWhat's a better rendering? Some options to consider:\n- \"pre-nihilist metaphysics\" (already listed as alternative from Chinese Philosophy expert)\n- \"classical metaphysics\"\n- \"traditional metaphysics\" (the author's own gloss)\n- \"pre-critical metaphysics\" (Kantian resonance)\n- Something else?\n\nKeep your response concise — what's your recommendation and why?\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"62c97aac-6f20-40a0-b192-70dbfe16f9c4","timestamp":"2026-02-10T23:47:47.915Z"}
