Let me check — I need to identify which expert field I am. Looking at my task assignment, I'm translator-2 (task #19). But the team lead is asking for experts' Analysis Reports. Let me check if I have an analysis report assigned to me.

I am translator-2, not an expert. The team lead's message says "experts only, not translator-2." Let me clarify this.

[tool: SendMessage]
{
  "type": "message",
  "recipient": "team-lead",
  "content": "I am translator-2, not one of the experts. Your roll call message says \"experts only, not translator-2\" — so this message was not directed at me.\n\nFor the record: I have all 8 essays + the 境集 index + the Translator Memo + the Translation Dictionary + the Draft loaded and confirmed. I do not have a field-specific Analysis Report because I am the translator, not an expert.\n\nStanding by for my next translation task.",
  "summary": "I am translator-2, not an expert — roll call not for me"
}

I've clarified with the team lead that the roll call was directed at the expert agents, not at me (translator-2). I'm standing by with all 8 essays, the index, and my translation materials fully loaded, ready for the next translation task.
