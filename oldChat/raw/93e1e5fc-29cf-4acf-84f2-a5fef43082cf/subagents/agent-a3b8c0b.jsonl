Not dangerous, but suboptimal.**\n\n**1. How misleading is \"virtue\" here?**\n\nIn the author's 后形而上学 essay, 德 functions as \"the set of properties that define what something is\" -- what makes a person a person, what makes a dog a dog. The author writes: \"凡事诸物皆有其德（我们认为他应该遵守的规律，使得一样东西成为其本身的东西）\" -- everything has its 德 (the regularities we believe it should follow, that which makes a thing what it is).\n\nThis is closer to Aristotle's \"essence\" or \"characteristic nature\" than to English \"virtue.\" When an English reader sees \"virtue,\" the immediate cognitive association is *moral excellence* -- courage, honesty, temperance. The reader must actively suppress this association to reach the author's meaning. This is not impossible, but it creates cognitive friction at every occurrence.\n\nThe problem is compounded in the formal framework. In 范畴论与境 整理, 德 appears in the meta-order examples as an intermediate abstraction level between 仁 and 道. If rendered as \"virtue,\" the English reader will parse the sequence as \"the Way generates Virtue, Virtue generates Humaneness...\" -- which sounds like a moral hierarchy. But the author's point is structural: 道 generates *characteristic natures* (德), one species of which is the human characteristic nature (仁). This is a taxonomic claim, not a moral one.\n\n**2. Alternatives?**\n\n- **\"De\" (romanized)**: Safest option for a text that already uses \"Jing\" as a romanized technical term. If the reader has already accepted \"Jing,\" accepting \"De\" is a small additional ask. The glossary defines it once; the reader carries the definition forward. This preserves the author's full semantic range without forcing a choice between moral and non-moral senses.\n\n- **\"Character\"**: Captures \"that which makes something what it is\" without moral baggage. \"The Way generates character, human character is humaneness...\" reads correctly. The downside: \"character\" in English can mean personality trait, fictional character, or written character -- polysemous in its own way. But the philosophical sense (\"the character of a thing\") is well-established.\n\n- **\"Inherent nature\"**: Accurate but clunky as a recurring term. Fine in a TN, not ideal in running text.\n\n**3. Can a TN fix \"virtue\"?**\n\nPartially. A TN can explain that \"virtue\" here means \"characteristic nature\" rather than \"moral excellence.\" But the problem with heavily loaded terms is that the TN must fight the reader's automatic association at *every* occurrence, not just the first. By the fifth paragraph, the reader has forgotten the TN and is back to reading \"virtue\" as moral excellence. This is a well-documented cognitive effect -- priming through familiar associations overrides definitional corrections.\n\n**My recommendation: Use \"De\" (romanized) as the primary term, with \"virtue/inherent nature\" in the glossary.** The text already establishes a precedent with \"Jing.\" The 道德仁义礼 sequence would read: \"the Way (Dao) generates De, human De is humaneness (ren)...\" -- clean, unambiguous, and the reader cannot accidentally import English moral connotations because \"De\" has no English connotations.
