Let me address the philosophical dimensions precisely.\n\n**The core question: what does the experiment require?**\n\nThe author uses the meme sentence to demonstrate a specific experiential phenomenon: the *failure* of eta --- the felt experience of reading a grammatically plausible sentence and being unable to construct the mental alignment that constitutes understanding. The experiment has two components:\n\n1. **The primary phenomenon**: eta-failure. The reader must *experience* not-understanding as a structural event, not just be told about it.\n\n2. **The secondary phenomenon** (introduced in the next paragraph): the author then says that if you learn the meme's cultural context through internet searching, you *can* obtain a kind of understanding --- but through the *cultural* category rather than the *grammatical* one. This demonstrates that eta can succeed in one categorical embedding while failing in another.\n\n**Does the experiment require cultural recognition?**\n\nNo, and this is crucial. The primary phenomenon (eta-failure) requires only semantic incomprehension --- the reader must encounter a sentence that is grammatically plausible but where mental simulation cannot track the structural unfolding. Cultural recognition as a meme is not necessary for this.\n\nHowever, the *secondary* phenomenon does require that the reader could *in principle* recover a kind of understanding through cultural context. This is what makes the meme sentence better than pure word-salad: it *has* meaning in a cultural register even though it lacks meaning in a grammatical register.\n\n**Does it matter whether the English reader's incomprehension is structurally identical to the Chinese reader's?**\n\nThis is where the author's own framework gives us the answer. Recall the structural verification criterion: we do not need ontological verification that two people have the *same* experience, only that their experiences occupy the *same structural position*. What matters is:\n\n- The English reader's experience of the substitute sentence occupies the position \"eta-failure in the grammatical/semantic category\"\n- The English reader could *in principle* learn the cultural context and shift to \"eta-success in the cultural category\"\n\nIf both conditions are met, the experiences are structurally commensurable regardless of whether the specific felt quality of Chinese-meme-incomprehension matches English-meme-incomprehension.\n\n**My recommendation: Option 2, with a specific modification.**\n\nReplace with the English meme, but present it in a way that preserves both phenomena. Something like:\n\n> [Main text]: ...when we cannot construct such a natural transformation --- for instance, when you read \"Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?\" and cannot complete a corresponding mental process to align with this sentence, you cannot obtain the feeling of \"I understand.\"\n\n> [Translator's note]: The original Chinese uses the internet meme \"你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国，记住我给出的原理,\" a deliberately absurdist sentence from Chinese internet culture that is grammatically plausible but semantically void. The English equivalent used here serves the same structural function. The author's subsequent point --- that understanding *can* be recovered through cultural context (learning the meme's origin and usage) even when grammatical comprehension fails --- applies equally to both sentences.\n\n**Why not the other options:**\n\n- **Option 1 (literal translation)** fails because, as you correctly identified, the English reads as a *bad translation* rather than as a natively incomprehensible sentence. The reader's experience would be \"I don't understand because this is poorly translated\" rather than \"I don't understand despite grammatical plausibility.\" These are *different structural positions* --- the first attributes the failure to the translation, the second to the sentence itself. The experiment requires the second.\n\n- **Option 3 (double presentation)** is viable but pedagogically cluttered. The passage is already dense with mathematical notation; adding romanized Chinese plus English equivalent plus note risks overwhelming the reader at exactly the moment when the text needs them to *have an experience*, not process metadata.\n\n- **Option 4 (literal + trust context)** has the same problem as Option 1. The surrounding explanation cannot compensate for the reader's experience being structurally wrong.\n\n**One additional consideration**: The \"Has anyone really been far\" meme is well-known in anglophone internet culture, which means some readers will *recognize* it and immediately shift to cultural understanding rather than experiencing the eta-failure first. If this is a concern, you could use a less famous but structurally equivalent English sentence --- something grammatically plausible but semantically void that most readers will not have encountered before. The philosophical requirement is: grammatically plausible, semantically untrackable, but possessing recoverable meaning in a cultural register. The specific meme matters less than the structural properties.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"66d6ed6b-c37a-4aee-8be0-d06854f43c08","timestamp":"2026-02-10T22:27:32.494Z"}

The author's footnote explains:\n- 虚 = \"without real significance\" (没有实在意义的)\n- 妄 = \"arrogant, self-deceptive\" (自大且自我蒙蔽的)\n\nThis describes the stance of someone who claims to reject ALL dreamscapes/meaning-structures — the radical nihilist who insists nothing matters. The author argues this is impossible because we are constituted by feeling.\n\nMy concern: In Buddhist Chinese, 虚妄 is a well-established term meaning \"illusory, unreal\" (related to maya/幻). The Heart Sutra's 远离颠倒梦想 treats this kind of 妄 as delusion to be transcended. The author's usage is DIFFERENT — it's not about illusion but about the arrogant pretension of claiming to stand outside all meaning-structures.\n\n**Questions**:\n1. Can you confirm that the author's 虚妄 is NOT the Buddhist 虚妄? Are there any risks of conflation?\n2.
