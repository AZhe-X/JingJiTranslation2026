*TN for category theory: *

Question from the author on 范畴 / category theory:

When category theory (范畴论) is first introduced in the translation, should there be a translator's note warning the reader: "not to be confused with Kant's categories (Kategorien)"?

The dictionary already notes the dual usage: (1) Kantian categories (pure concepts of understanding), (2) mathematical category theory (objects and morphisms). The author primarily uses sense (2) but the philosophical overlap with sense (1) is intentional.

Does a TN help orient the reader, or is it unnecessary / patronizing? Would the average philosophically literate English reader be confused by "category theory" appearing in a philosophical text? Keep your response concise.

The TN should not say \"don't confuse these\" (patronizing) but rather: \"The author uses category theory in the mathematical sense (objects, morphisms, functors). The resonance with Kant's categories is not accidental: both concern the structural conditions under which experience becomes intelligible. However, the formal apparatus here is mathematical, not Kantian.\"\n\nThis does three things at once: disambiguates the primary sense, valid
