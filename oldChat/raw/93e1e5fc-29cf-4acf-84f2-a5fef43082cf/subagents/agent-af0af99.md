Another stale task assignment from the earlier session. Let me verify.

[tool: TaskGet]
{
  "taskId": "23"
}

Confirmed — Task 23 is also already completed. The Editor/Memo.md already contains the "## Dictionary Notes" section with term-tracking checklist and glossing conventions. Stale message, no action needed.

Still awaiting the team-lead's response regarding next assignment.
