The anti-priming logic is decisive. Phil-mind's concern is valid in principle but the counter-argument is correct: if experiential effects don't surface unprompted via Q2, that is itself the most important data point.\n\n**Revision 3 (split Q5):** APPROVE. Double-barreled questions conflate distinct variables. Clean separation.\n\n**Revision 4 (stayed with you / didn't land):** APPROVE. \"Didn't fully land\" keeps the reader in experiential mode and avoids implying a right answer.\n\n**Revision 5 (marginal notes):** APPROVE. The revised \"If you made any...\" framing correctly handles non-note-takers. Pre-reflective data is more valuable than post-hoc reconstruction.\n\n**Revision 6 (no essay-specific per-essay questions):** APPROVE. I had originally proposed essay-specific checks but explicitly recommended they go at the end, not per-essay. The unanimous decision to reject per-essay specifics is correct. My proposed checks for Essays 1, 2, 5, and 6 are effectively captured in Revision 7's expanded Critical Experiential Checks.\n\n**Revision 7 (expanded checks):** APPROVE. One note: the Essay 2 probe (\"did you notice a difference?\") tests the bilingual register shift rather than the epistemological content. This is fine — the per-essay generic questions will have already captured the JTB-collapse experience if it occurred. The register-shift probe adds a distinct data point. I note that my proposed Bob-specific probe (\"What stood out to you about the three scenarios involving Bob?\") was not included, which is acceptable — if the Bob scenarios produced a strong effect, it will appear in the per-essay \"clicked or shifted\" response for Essay 2. Adding it as a ninth probe at the end would risk over-questioning.\n\n**Revision 8 (Essay 5-6 transition flag):** APPROVE. Correctly identified as a risk point. The internal-note format is appropriate.\n\nNo amendments needed. Clean synthesis.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"96847f65-6e01-4e21-ae82-a4fff1a60d19","timestamp":"2026-02-11T09:22:21.384Z"}
