The Way generates all things; the Way is the most \"primordial\" *metaphysics*, and everything that follows from it is *generated*. Thus the Way is the highest — it is the metaphysical — while ritual conduct is the lowest — it is the phenomenal.[^TN2]\n\nHowever, ritual conduct is in fact summarized from phenomena. Let us call the **actual** behavior in phenomena \"phenomenal ritual conduct.\" I have an **explanation** for phenomenal ritual conduct: it is the feeling that arises from within me when I face another person — a feeling of concern for the other. This feeling is something I **actually** feel, and is therefore part of phenomena; I call it \"phenomenal humaneness.\" This feeling impels me to treat the other person in such-and-such a way; this driving force (*motivation*) is also something I **actually** feel, and so I call it \"phenomenal rightness.\"[^3] Phenomenal ritual conduct exists not only in how I treat others, but equally in how other people treat one another. We therefore extend phenomenal humaneness and phenomenal rightness as our **explanation** of phenomenal ritual conduct more broadly. That is to say: because phenomenal ritual conduct (apparently) manifests in everyone around us, and because we interpret phenomenal ritual conduct as \"phenomenal humaneness generates phenomenal rightness, which in turn generates phenomenal ritual conduct,\" we conclude that everyone who practices phenomenal ritual conduct (ought to) possess this phenomenal humaneness.[^4]\n\nNext, we take what we believe (ought to be) universally possessed — here, phenomenal humaneness — and call it \"character.\"[^TN3] And why should there be such a universal pattern? Because of \"the Way.\"[^24]\n\nWe can now see that, at the level of phenomena, humaneness and rightness are merely an *explanation* of ritual conduct. As for what we observe of external phenomena, in fact we have only seen the phenomenal ritual conduct within phenomena, and from it we **infer** phenomenal rightness, and from phenomenal rightness we **infer** phenomenal humaneness — even though **no** actual phenomenal rightness or phenomenal humaneness appears in *my* phenomena, because the feeling that arises from within and the driving force are only what **I** feel when **I** practice phenomenal ritual conduct. I cannot truly feel **another person's** inner feelings; I have merely **applied** my explanation of \"**my own** phenomenal ritual conduct\" to the phenomenal ritual conduct we observe **others** performing. Therefore, the humaneness and rightness in other people are in fact *generated from* the phenomenal ritual conduct in phenomena. But in our interpretation, we take it to be the reverse: humaneness generates rightness, and rightness issues in ritual conduct — as though phenomenal ritual conduct were generated *by* humaneness and rightness.\n\nNext, on the basis of this generated humaneness and rightness, we conclude: \"all people possess humaneness.\" But in fact it is: \"all people (**can**) possess humaneness,\" since we discovered from many people who exhibit humaneness that many people have it — humaneness is thus a **property** we have inductively generalized. Yet our final understanding becomes: \"all people (**should**) possess humaneness\" — or rather, \"only those who possess humaneness count as human.\" And so a **property** that a person can have — here, humaneness — is transformed into a **definition** of personhood. These definitions, taken together, define **what a person is** — that is, \"character\": that which makes a person a person.[^TN4] We thus see that character, too, is in fact generated from humaneness — yet in our understanding we take it to be the reverse: *because* you are a person, *therefore* you must possess humaneness. Finally, character is a general pattern, because all things have their character (the pattern we take them to follow, that which makes a thing what it is), and so we gather all instances of character together, inductively abstract from them, and arrive at \"the Way.\" The Way, then, is in fact generated from character — yet we understand it as the Way generating character.\n\nThus the entire logical order is reversed. The Way generates character; the character of a person is humaneness; from humaneness arises rightness; from rightness comes ritual conduct. But this final \"ritual conduct\" is no longer the original phenomenal ritual conduct, because the logic by which phenomenal ritual conduct generated \"the Way\" has been **buried from view** — it has been entirely **lost**. People take the Way to be the most primordial metaphysics. And so the ritual conduct that is finally generated is now merely a norm, and not necessarily the original phenomenal ritual conduct that (in the explanation) arose from within the heart.\n\nIn practice, this loss continues cascading downward, level after level — pursuing the branches and forgetting the root. The above is not an interpretation of the *Laozi*; rather, in this passage there happens to appear precisely this kind of staircase running from the metaphysical down to the phenomenal, and so I use it here as an example.\n\n---\n\n## Footnotes\n\n[^3]: Humaneness, rightness, and ritual conduct are in fact already a metaphysical framework. And yet we cannot help but rely on some framework to describe phenomena; thus even though I have tried my utmost to restore their original phenomenal character, the account remains imprecise. In Chinese philosophy, humaneness and rightness are often mentioned together. Humaneness (仁) is said to be *loving others*; rightness (义) is said to be *what one ought to do*. In the conventional understanding — to take loving one's father as an example of humaneness — what I *ought to do* out of love for my father is rightness. And the concrete behavior that fulfills this rightness is ritual conduct. Rightness is thus the thing that connects humaneness to concrete action (ritual conduct). At the phenomenal level, I use \"phenomenal humaneness\" to describe the inner feeling (of love) I have toward my father — a feeling that impels me to act in certain ways. This driving force, this \"motivation\" itself, is what connects my feeling (phenomenal humaneness) to my behavior (phenomenal ritual conduct), and so it is fitting to call it phenomenal rightness.\n\n[^4]: The phenomenal humaneness and phenomenal rightness thus extended to others are no longer within *my* phenomena.\n\n[^24]: A note of caution: the interpretation of \"the Way\" (道) more faithful to Daoist thought would be closer to *that which makes existence itself possible* — pictorially, something like the canvas on which a painting is made. Here, we are merely expressing in structural terms that \"the Way\" can be understood to determine and generate \"character.\"\n\n---\n\n## Translator's Notes\n\n[^TN1]: Translation adapted from Ivanhoe (2003). Key terms follow this volume's glossary. Cf. Ivanhoe: \"When the Way was lost there was Virtue; When Virtue was lost there was benevolence; When benevolence was lost there was righteousness; When righteousness was lost there were the rites.\" We render 仁 as \"humaneness\" (following Ames & Rosemont) rather than \"benevolence,\" 义 as \"rightness\" rather than \"righteousness\" to capture the author's usage as motivational disposition rather than moral judgment, and 礼 as \"ritual conduct\" to emphasize the behavioral dimension.\n\n[^TN2]: The author interprets 形 (xing, \"form\") in the classical term 形而上 as equivalent to 现象 (phenomena). In the *Xici zhuan* (Commentary on the Appended Phrases, *Yijing*), 形 conventionally means \"visible form\" or \"physical shape.\" The author's reinterpretation — phenomena as the ground, the metaphysical as what is built upon it — is a significant philosophical departure. See the Translator's Introduction for further discussion.\n\n[^TN3]: The author now reconceives 德 (de) not as virtue in the moral sense but as (constitutive) character — the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. Hereafter shortened to \"character.\" This constructivist reading departs from both the standard Confucian sense of 德 as moral virtue and the Daoist sense of 德 as natural potency.\n\n[^TN4]: Note the crucial reversal: a *property* that people happen to have (observed inductively) becomes a *definition* of what people are (imposed normatively). This is the mechanism by which phenomena are transformed into the metaphysical — the bottom-up construction is concealed, and the result appears to be top-down.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":35,"oldLines":7,"newStart":35,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," Here, the Way, virtue, humaneness, rightness, and ritual conduct run from first to last as from top to bottom.
