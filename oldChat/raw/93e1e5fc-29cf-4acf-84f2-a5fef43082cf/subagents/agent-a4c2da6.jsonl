Key points:\n\n**Already incorporated:**\n- NO essay-specific per-essay questions: You're in the majority (5 NO vs 3 YES with constraints). Plan puts all essay-specific probing in Critical Checks at end.\n- Essay 5 and Essay 1 Critical Checks: Both in the expanded checks (you're the 8th independent proposal for Essay 5).\n- Q4 softening: Incorporated (epistemology-expert's wording, which is close to yours).\n- \"Tell a friend\" prompts: Unchanged.\n\n**New proposal I'm noting:**\n- **Sequential delivery of Critical Experiential Checks:** This is an excellent point not raised by anyone else. If we deliver all 8 probes at once, the reader sees the full set and can construct a retrospective narrative across essays. Delivering them one at a time (Essay 1 first, wait for response, then Essay 2, etc.) preserves the independence of each report. I'll flag this for the next iteration — it's a delivery-mechanism change, not a content change, but it matters methodologically.\n\nStanding by per team lead's instructions.
