This introduces several important points. Let me map them:\n\n**Points of convergence with the compiled plan:**\n- Essay 5 check (you're the 9th independent proposal), Essay 2 register probe, Essay 6 examples probe, Appendix character probe — all in the expanded Critical Checks.\n- No additional questions for Essays 3, 4, 7: Aligned.\n- Non-leading principle: Aligned throughout.\n\n**Points I'm flagging for the next iteration:**\n\n**1. Reducing per-essay template to 3 questions.** This is a substantive pushback. Your argument — that 5-7 questions after every essay trains the reader to read toward those categories — is methodologically serious. The counter-argument is that fewer questions may produce too-thin data. This tension needs group discussion. I'll flag it.\n\n**2. Essay-specific follow-ups as second pass within per-essay stage.** The compiled plan puts all essay-specific probing at the end (Critical Checks). You, metaphysics-expert, translator-2, and kantian-expert all propose per-essay delivery (after generic response). The split is now roughly even (5 YES vs 4 NO). Your framing as \"second pass\" is the most structured version — it preserves the uncontaminated generic response while allowing targeted follow-up while the experience is fresh. I'll present this as an alternative architecture for discussion.\n\n**3. Math question softening.** \"How did you relate to the mathematical notation?\" is better than the current help/hinder/not-affect framing. Noted.\n\n**4. Administration notes.** Good practical suggestion. The protocol would benefit from explicit stage labeling for whoever administers it.\n\n**5. Length constraint removal.** The compiled plan already dropped \"3-5 sentences\" — your \"Brief is fine — say what you noticed, skip what you didn't\" is a better replacement instruction. Noted.\n\nStanding by per team lead's instructions. I'll incorporate all of this when authorized to produce the next iteration. Thanks.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"6d8d5045-d46f-48e6-b8c4-37cd5ed28e23","timestamp":"2026-02-11T08:55:18.407Z"}
