*Correction: use 整理 version only, not 其一*

**CORRECTION**: Use the 整理 (cleaned-up) version of 后形而上学, NOT the 其一 (draft) version. The 8 essays are:

1. `22 随笔/关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一.md`
2. `23 Reflection/A Thought on Knowledge.md`
3. `22 随笔/西西弗斯、班与猫.md`
4. `21 无知者的自我记录/后形而上学 整理.md`
5. `21 无知者的自我记录/形而上学后的目的：诗意.md`
6. `21 无知者的自我记录/范畴论与境.md`
7. `21 无知者的自我记录/范畴论与境：K1策略.md`
8. `21 无知者的自我记录/关于诗意和境的一些零散想法.md`

Do NOT load 后形而上学 其一. Only the 整理 version.

Understood. My analysis already covered 后形而上学 整理 as the primary source for Essay 4, and the references I made to 后形而上学 其一 were supplementary — they don't change the conclusions. The key data points from 其一 (the 感受 section heading at line 159, the inner/outer bridging at line 125) are consistent with what appears in the 整理 version.

However, let me confirm: does this correction affect my analysis or recommendation in any way? Let me check whether any of my cited passages from 其一 introduced conclusions not supported by the 整理 version.

The two passages I cited from 其一 were:
- Line 123: 现象包括...我们自己内心和对我们身体的感受 — this same point is made in 整理 line 16 (我们所感受到的世界)
- Line 125: 其一为感受，其二为行为 — this inner/outer bridging point is unique to 其一, but it's supplementary context, not load-bearing for my recommendation

My recommendation of **"feeling"** for 感受 stands unchanged. All the critical evidence — the author's own two-sense definition in 诗意 footnote [^2], the 感受/体验 interchangeability declaration in 范畴论与境 line 166, the existential claim at 诗意 line 27 — comes from the correct 8 essays, not from 其一.

The two supplementary references to 其一 were consistent with 整理 but not essential to my argument. Recommendation of \"feeling\" for 感受 stands.",
