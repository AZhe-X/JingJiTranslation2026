*经验: empirical experience or experience?*

Quick confirmation needed on the 经验 (jīngyàn) entry in the Translation Dictionary.

Context: During the 感受 debate, the consensus term mapping was:
- 感受 → "feeling" (default) / "felt experience" (technical)
- 体验 → "experience" 
- 经验 → "empirical experience"
- 感觉 → "sensation"

The question: Should the standalone 经验 dictionary entry have **"empirical experience"** or **"experience"** as its MAIN translation?

Arguments for "empirical experience":
- Distinguishes clearly from 体验 ("experience") in the term mapping
- Captures the accumulated, reflected-upon, Erfahrung quality
- The author uses it in phrases like "经验的总结/预测/抽象" (summary/prediction/abstraction OF empirical experience) and "经验性的" (empirical)
- Prevents reader confusion between 体验 and 经验

Arguments for plain "experience":
- More natural in English
- "Empirical" is implicit in context
- Adding "empirical" every time could feel heavy

Please respond with your position: "empirical experience" or "experience" as main translation for 经验, with brief reasoning.

  "content": "**\"Experience\"** as the main entry, with \"empirical\" added when the author uses the adjectival form 经验性的.\n\nReasoning: The author's actual usage splits into two patterns:\n- **经验性的** (adjectival) → \"empirical\" — as in 经验的总结/预测/抽象 (Essay 4 section headers: \"empirical summary,\" \"empirical prediction,\" \"empirical abstraction\")\n- **经验** (standalone noun) → \"experience\" — as in 经验结构 (K1 line 205: \"experiential structure\"), 经验与模式 (K1 line 207: \"experience and patterns\")\n\nWriting \"empirical experience\" every time the noun appears would create phrases like \"empirical experience and patterns\" or \"empirical experience structure\" — heavier

Recommended **"experience"** as the main dictionary entry for 经验, with "empirical" reserved for the adjectival form 经验性的. The author's usage naturally splits between these two patterns, and context disambiguates from 体验 without needing to write "empirical experience" every time. Standing by.
