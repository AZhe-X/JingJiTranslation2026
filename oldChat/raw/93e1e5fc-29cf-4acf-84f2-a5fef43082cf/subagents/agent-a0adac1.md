*Vote: does Preface have spoilers? If yes, are they fine?*

ALL TEAM MEMBERS — two questions:

**Question 1: Does the current Translator's Preface (DRAFT-R2) contain spoilers?**
Vote YES or NO. (By "spoilers" we mean: does it pre-reveal philosophical conclusions, experiential payoffs, or argument outcomes that the essays are designed to produce through the reader's own experience?)

**Question 2 (only if you voted YES to Q1): Are those spoilers FINE or NOT FINE?**
- FINE = the spoilers are acceptable/necessary for the Preface to do its job
- NOT FINE = the spoilers undermine the experiential sequences and should be removed

Brief reason for each answer (1-2 sentences).

Let me re-read the current DRAFT-R2 to give a precise answer.

The dissolution of absurdity — demonstrated in Essay 3 through the progression from Sisyphus to cat ownership — occurs not through revolt but through inhabiting a Jing in which meaning is internally generated.\" This pre-reveals both the conclusion of Essay 3 and the mechanism by which it works.\n\n- Line 46: \"of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat\" — tells the reader what they are supposed to feel before they feel it.\n\n- Line 50: \"the author treats nihilism not as the negation of metaphysics but as its *consequence*\"
