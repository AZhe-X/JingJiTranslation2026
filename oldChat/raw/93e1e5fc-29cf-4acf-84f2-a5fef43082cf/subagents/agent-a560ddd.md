*Final review: Preface + Afterword blueprint — confirm or advise*

**Final review round.** Please read both documents and respond with **CONFIRM** or **ADVICE** (with specific suggestion):

1. **Translator's Preface (DRAFT-R3):**
`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Draft/Translators-Preface.md`

2. **Afterword Blueprint (updated):**
`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Editor/Afterword-Blueprint.md`

Check both for completeness, accuracy, and anything missing from your domain. This is the final check before we move on.

The redundancy fix works — line 48 now carries the key sentence (\"The relationship between the two parts is itself part of the argument\") as the close of the Fish/Fishing section, which reads naturally. No Kantian-domain issues. All terminological framing in the \"Note on Terminology\" section is accurate from my perspective.\n\n**Afterword Blueprint:** The Kantian section (lines 54-62) is complete and accurate. My Zeroth Reality amendment is correctly incorporated. The five bullet points cover the essential Kantian connections: the meaning question as \"another kind of Kantian question,\" S_E as conditions of possible experience, the
