*Renaming realities: Ultimate/Secondary instead of First/Second?*

The author is considering an alternative numbering/naming scheme for the three realities. Currently the dictionary has:

- 第〇实在 → Zeroth Reality
- 第一实在 → First Reality  
- 第二实在 → Second Reality

The author's proposal:

- 第〇实在 → **Zeroth Reality** (with TN: "Ultimate Reality")
- 第一实在 → **Ultimate Reality** (with TN: "First Reality" in the original)
- 第二实在 → **Secondary Reality** (with TN: "Second Reality" in the original)

So the proposal promotes 第一实在 from "First" to "Ultimate" and demotes 第二实在 from "Second" to "Secondary." 第〇实在 keeps "Zeroth" but gets a TN linking it to "Ultimate Reality" in traditional metaphysics.

Is this a good idea? Does renaming 第一实在 as "Ultimate Reality" better capture its role (phenomena as the indubitable ground)? Or does it create confusion — since the author explicitly says (footnote 25) that 第一实在 is a *name* (名称), not an ontological claim about what is "most real"? And does calling 第二实在 "Secondary" imply it is lesser/derivative in a way the author may not intend?

Keep your response concise — yes/no with brief reasoning.

It imports the very metaphysical weight the post-metaphysical framework strips away. A reader encountering \"Ultimate Reality\" will think the author is asserting that phenomena are the most real thing -- but the author is asserting only that phenomena are the *first thing we encounter*, the unavoidable starting point. \"First\" captures priority of access; \"Ultimate\" implies priority of being.\n\n2. **\"Secondary Reality\" does imply lesser/derivative.** In English,

Sent my response. No to the renaming -- "Ultimate Reality" contradicts the author's own footnote 25 by importing ontological weight the post-metaphysical framework explicitly refuses, "Secondary" carries evaluative connotations of inferiority, and the 0/1/2 numbering mirrors the tower structure's meta-order levels. Keep the neutral ordinals; let translator's notes do the contextualizing.
