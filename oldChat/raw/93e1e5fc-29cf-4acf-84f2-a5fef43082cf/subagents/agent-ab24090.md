*Confirming 诗意 resolution: *

The author endorses the current resolution for 诗意 (shiyi):

- **"the poetic"** as the standard substantive form
- **"poetic"** as adjective
- **"poeticality"** acceptable as an occasional variant noun
- **Capitalize "the Poetic"** in the translator's introduction and glossary to signal philosophical weight

Does everyone still agree with this resolution? Any second thoughts now that we've been through the full dictionary discussion? Concise yes/no + any brief additions.

It sounds like academic jargon and lacks the clean simplicity of \"the poetic.\" Every instance where you might reach for \"poeticality\" can likely be handled by \"the poetic\" or a rephrasing. Reserve it only for contexts where a standard English noun is grammatically unavoidable and \"the poetic\" cannot be made to work.\n\nEverything else -- \"the poetic\" as substantive, \"poetic\" as adjective, capitalized \"the Poetic\" in glossary/introduction -- is exactly right."

Still agree. Only reservation: use "poeticality" very sparingly -- it sounds like jargon and "the poetic" can handle almost every context. Standing by.
