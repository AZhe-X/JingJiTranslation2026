Translation is a distinct skill from analysis. The primary translator needs three capabilities simultaneously:\n\n1. **Native-level command of Chinese** -- to read the source accurately, including the classical Chinese quotations (Laozi, Mengzi, Yijing), the colloquial register (the cat essay, the magic book examples), and the technical register (the category theory essays). Misreading the source is the most catastrophic failure mode.\n\n2. **Strong English philosophical prose** -- not academic jargon, but clear, precise prose that can handle the author's range from informal to formal. The essays have a distinctive voice: personal, exploratory, sometimes playful, sometimes rigorous. The translator must reproduce this voice, not flatten it into uniform academic English.\n\n3. **Philosophical sensitivity** -- the translator must understand what is philosophically at stake in each passage in order to make correct choices when the Chinese is ambiguous or when the experiential rhythm (see section 6.4 of my report) must be preserved at the cost of literal accuracy. This is where our expert reports serve as the reference material.\n\nA dedicated philosophical translator, consulting our 8-9 expert reports and term dictionaries, is the correct architecture. The experts provide the map; the translator does the writing. Mixing the two roles risks producing either accurate-but-wooden prose (if an analyst writes) or fluent-but-imprecise prose (if a literary translator writes without philosophical guidance).\n\nThe ideal profile: someone like a bilingual philosophy PhD who has translated philosophical texts before -- someone in the mold of Burton Watson, A.C. Graham, or Brook Ziporyn for Chinese philosophy, or someone like Joan Stambaugh or David Farrell Krell for German phenomenological texts.\n\n### Why chinese-phil-expert as Second Choice\n\nIf we cannot add a new agent, the chinese-phil-expert is the most natural fit because: (a) they presumably have the strongest command of the Chinese source text, including classical quotations; (b) the essays are grounded in a Chinese philosophical sensibility even when engaging Western frameworks; (c) they can draw on all other experts' reports for Western philosophical precision.\n\n### Self-Recommendation\n\n**I do not self-recommend.** My strength is in identifying how the author's concepts map onto the Western metaphysical tradition and flagging translation-critical terms. I am not a translator. My analysis is most useful as a reference document that the translator consults, not as a basis for my own writing.
