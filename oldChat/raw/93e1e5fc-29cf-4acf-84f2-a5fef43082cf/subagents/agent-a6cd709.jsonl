Education level | 7 | Important but instrumental. We need reading stamina, not credentials. A voracious autodidact would serve as well as a graduate student. The 7 reflects that some threshold of sophistication is necessary -- below it, reports will measure reading difficulty rather than translation quality -- but the exact level matters less than the disposition. |\n| B. No philosophy specialization | 8 | High. A philosophy specialist will read analytically from the start -- categorizing arguments, spotting influences, evaluating validity. That is precisely the wrong mode for testing whether the experiential sequences work. Essay 3's cat example needs to land as recognition, not as \"an argument by analogy against Camus.\" The higher score reflects that philosophical training actively interferes with naive reading in a way that most other specializations do not. |\n| C. No category theory / formal math | 9 | Very high. The collection explicitly claims its philosophical content is accessible through examples alone, with the formalism providing optional structure for those who want it. This is a testable claim, and the standby reader is our only opportunity to test it. A reader with category theory training cannot tell us whether the pen example, the magic book, and the cat on the table carry the philosophical content independently. This is nearly the single most important thing we are testing. |\n| D. No prior exposure to essays/materials | 10 | Non-negotiable. If the reader has seen any of our drafts, source texts, expert reports, or internal discussions, they cannot function as a naive reader. This is a binary requirement, not a gradient. |\n| E. Basic cultural literacy | 6 | Helpful but not critical. The collection provides its own context for Sisyphus (retelling the myth), for Laozi (block quote with gloss), and for metaphysics (the author's reinterpretation is explained). A reader who has never heard of Sisyphus would still encounter the myth in the essay itself. That said, some baseline cultural furniture makes the reading less effortful and allows the reader to notice *departures* from what they vaguely know -- which is itself part of the experiential design. Moderate importance. |\n| F. Comfort with abstract ideas | 8 | High. The collection moves between concrete examples and abstract argument throughout. A reader who cannot follow \"the justification for a belief reduces to another belief\" will stall in Essay 2 and never reach the payoff. This is a threshold requirement: below it, the reader cannot engage; above it, additional comfort adds diminishing returns. |\n| G. Tolerance for foreign terms and notation | 7 | Important. The collection is dense with romanized Chinese, mathematical symbols, and coined terminology. A reader who is put off by \"Jing (境)\" or \"E\" on the page will disengage before the content has a chance to work. But this is partly a function of how well our translator's apparatus does its job -- if the glosses and introductions work, the tolerance threshold lowers. We are partly testing whether our apparatus makes the foreign terms navigable. |\n| H. Curious and patient disposition | 9 | Very high. This is where I feel strongest from my domain. The collection's method -- particularly in Essays 3, 5, and the Appendix -- requires the reader to stay with an unfolding sequence rather than jumping to conclusions. Camus's own writing demands the same patience: you must follow the argument through its full arc before the reversal lands. A reader who skims, or who decides after two paragraphs that they \"get it,\" will miss precisely the moments that matter most. Curiosity is what keeps someone reading through unfamiliar territory; patience is what allows the experiential sequences to complete their arc. Without both, the reader will produce reports about surface impressions rather than about whether the deep structure works. |\n| I. Honest about confusion | 9 | Very high. A deferential reader who assumes \"if I don't understand, it must be my fault\" will suppress exactly the signals we need. The standby reader's primary value is as a diagnostic instrument. An instrument that conceals its readings is worse than useless -- it gives false confidence. We need someone who will say \"I read this paragraph three times and still don't know what 'phenomenal rightness' means in practice\" rather than nodding along. |\n| J. Experientially attentive | 10 | The single most important dimension alongside D. This is the entire reason we are adding a standby reader. Every expert on this team has independently flagged that the collection's experiential sequences are its philosophical content, not merely its delivery method. If the reader can only report \"the argument was X\" and not \"when I read the cat example, something shifted,\" we learn nothing about whether the translation preserves what matters most. This capacity -- noticing what happens to you while reading, being able to articulate a felt shift, a moment of recognition, a sense of the ground moving -- is rare and essential. It is the difference between a reader who can test the translation and one who can only summarize it. |\n| K. Life experience | 7 | Important for specific essays. Essay 3 requires that the reader has experienced repetitive labor and can recognize the phenomenological difference between alienated and non-alienated work. The cat example requires some familiarity with pet ownership (or at minimum, the cultural understanding of it). The coin-flip example in the Appendix requires having faced genuine decisions. These are not exotic requirements -- most adults over 25 have this furniture. But a very young reader, or one whose life has been unusually sheltered, would lack the experiential ground that the essays appeal to. |\n| L. Reads literary fiction / prose quality | 5 | Relevant but secondary. The collection is not primarily a literary achievement -- its register is exploratory and thinking-aloud, not polished. A reader with strong literary sensibilities might over-attend to prose quality and under-attend to philosophical content. That said, sensitivity to register shifts (colloquial to formal to near-lyrical) is valuable, and someone who reads good prose will notice when the translation sounds \"off\" in ways a less literary reader would not. Moderate importance, but the lowest priority among these dimensions. |\n\n**Summary ranking**: D (10) = J (10) > C (9) = H (9) = I (9) > B (8) = F (8) > A (7) = G (7) = K (7) > E (6) > L (5)\n\nThe top tier (D, J) is non-negotiable.

It bypasses academic reporting mode and asks for the reader's actual understanding -- what they absorbed, what they think matters, what they would select as worth communicating. It is also diagnostic in ways that more structured questions are not: if the reader says \"it's about how meaning is constructed from experience\" we know the core argument landed; if they say \"it's about Chinese philosophy and math\" we know it didn't.\n\n**Refinement**: Add a second part -- \"Would you recommend it to that friend? Why or why not?\" This tests engagement, not just comprehension. A reader might accurately summarize the collection while finding it tedious, which is important information. And the \"why or why not\" forces them to articulate what worked and what didn't in experiential rather than analytical terms -- \"because the cat example will make them laugh and then think\" is a very different answer from \"because the formal framework is rigorous,\" and both tell us something about what the translation preserved.","summary":"Dimension weights and YES vote on tell-a-friend prompt"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":614,"cache_read_input_tokens":53792,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":614},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY1yTcVmANbFW2X8ZANhc","type":"assistant","uuid":"acc34a71-763b-428c-997e-36f84ab9b7bc","timestamp":"2026-02-11T08:35:27.379Z"}
