However, the final tally is 7-3 (8-3 including my own editorial position) in favor of keeping the text as-is. The majority view is that the reversal is processual — knowing *that* it occurs and even knowing the content of both directions does not diminish the experience of *tracking each step* through the phenomenological reconstruction. The essay itself announces the reversal before performing it.\n\nYour position is recorded as minority dissent alongside Phil-mind and Chinese-phil experts. The proposal proceeds with the majority version.\n\nIs this acceptable as registered dissent, or is it a blocking objection? The team lead has confirmed 10/10 consensus, so I want to confirm you can proceed with the majority decision on this point.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"f89b5f17-f7ab-40c8-8cea-a3168c64dd82","timestamp":"2026-02-11T07:51:21.748Z"}
