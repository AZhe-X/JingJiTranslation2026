I need to assess my current context. I am the **translator** agent (translator-2), not one of the 9 experts. Let me review what I have and what I need to do based on my Profile.

Looking at my Profile, I'm at **Step 2**: Read the 9 expert Analysis Reports, add notes to Memo.md. Let me check what currently exists in my Memo.md and then start reading the expert reports.

  "file_path": "/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Memo.md"

Good. My Memo.md is comprehensive and already includes all expert report notes (Step 2), the Overall Translation Approach (Step 3), and all 7 questions resolved (Steps 4-5). The previous instance completed all steps.

Now, the team lead's message was addressed to "ALL 9 EXPERTS (not translator-2, not editor)" — so it explicitly excludes me (translator-2). This is a context integrity check directed at the expert agents, not at me.

I should report to the team lead that I received their message but that it wasn't directed at me, and confirm my own status.

  "type": "message",

Memo.md contains:\n- Step 1: Reading notes for all 8+1 essays (done by previous instance)\n- Step 2: Expert Report Notes for all 9 domains (metaphysics, phenomenology, epistemology, existentialism, phil-mind, Kantian, Chinese philosophy, Buddhism, Wittgenstein)\n- Step 3: Overall Translation Approach (8 sections: title/central term, core glossary, register strategy, classical Chinese format, structural principles, translator's apparatus, reference translations, expert consultation results)\n- Steps 4-5: All 7 questions (Q1-Q7) sent to experts an

I've reported my status to the team lead. I note the routing shows me as "epistemology-expert" which seems to be a system-level agent ID assignment, but my role in this conversation is translator-2 as specified in the Profile. The team lead should understand from my message content.

I'm now idle and awaiting further direction from the team lead.
