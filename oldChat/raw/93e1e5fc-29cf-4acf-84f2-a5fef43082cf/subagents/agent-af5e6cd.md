*现象X: light individually, dense cumulatively — hybrid editing strategy*

Excellent question. The answer is **both, in different ways** — and the distinction matters for your editing strategy.

**The compounds themselves are light.** 现象礼 is three characters, three syllables, read in under a second. Chinese readers process 现象 as a single unit (like "pheno-") and 礼 as a familiar monosyllable. The compound is compact the way "subtext" or "feedback" is in English — coined but immediately parseable. The same goes for 现象仁 and 现象义. At the individual-occurrence level, these feel like natural technical coinages, not heavy constructions. A Chinese reader does not stumble on any single instance.

**But the repetition is deliberately dense and accumulative.** Re-read line 24 of the original: 现象礼 appears 5 times, 现象仁 appears 3 times, 现象义 appears 2 times — in a single paragraph. The author is building a machine in front of the reader, bolt by bolt. Each recurrence tightens the argument: "现象礼" → "现象仁 produces 现象义 which produces 现象礼" → "all people who practice 现象礼 should have 现象仁." The accumulation IS the philosophical payload. The reader feels the web being woven. By the end of the paragraph, the reversal has been constructed step by step before the reader's eyes. This density is not accidental — it mirrors the constructive process the author is describing. The repetition makes you feel what it is like to build a metaphysical hierarchy from the ground up.

**So here is my recommendation for your editing strategy: a hybrid.**

1. **Keep the English repetition.** Do not abbreviate "phenomenal ritual conduct" to "PRC" or introduce shorthand. Do not substitute pronouns where the author repeats the full term. The accumulation is functional — it is the construction happening in real time. The reader should feel the weight building.

2. **But manage the syllabic density through sentence architecture.** The Chinese achieves density without heaviness because Chinese sentences are paratactic (clauses placed side by side with minimal connectives) and the compounds are short. English sentences are hypotactic (subordinated, with explicit connectives) and the compounds are long. So: use shorter sentences, more periods, fewer subordinate clauses. Let each step of the construction breathe as its own sentence or short clause. Where the Chinese stacks three 现象X terms in one clause, the English can split them across two sentences without losing the accumulative effect — in fact, the pause between sentences can create the "click" of each piece being placed.

3. **The heaviness should peak at the reversal moment (line 28: "the entire logical order has been reversed").** By that point, the accumulated weight of all the "phenomenal X" repetitions should feel like a structure that has been fully assembled. The reader should feel the weight of what has been built — and then the reversal flips it. If the English feels uniformly heavy throughout, the reversal has no contrast. If it feels light throughout, the reversal has no mass. The density should build paragraph by paragraph, reaching maximum density at "phenomenal humaneness generates phenomenal rightness, which generates phenomenal ritual conduct," and then the reversal sentence should be comparatively stark and clean.

In short: the compounds are light in Chinese but the passage is deliberately dense. Preserve the density but use English sentence rhythm to give it shape — a crescendo toward the reversal, not a uniform wall.

Now let me share this insight with the translator, since it directly affects how they should structure sentences in the phenomenal-X paragraphs going forward.

Q1 resolved and shared with translator. Let me consider whether I have additional questions that need expert consultation before more draft sections arrive.

Looking at my editorial notes, the other potential question I identified was about the magic book examples in Essay 6 (猫猫变鼠鼠 — playful reduplication). But that question is better asked when I actually have a draft of Essay 6 to review, since the editing challenge is concrete and context-dependent. No point asking in the abstract.

I don't have other pressing questions at this stage. Standing by for the next draft section or team-lead instructions.
