The author proposes a compromise: "constitutive character" for 德.

This combines:
- "Constitutive" (from chinese-phil-expert) — signals constructivism, neutral on innate/constructed, philosophical pedigree
- "Character" (from wittgenstein/existentialism/phil-mind) — avoids 性/nature collision, universal ("the character of water"), no moral baggage

Format: "constitutive character (德 De)" at first occurrence, then "constitutive character" in running text.

Quick vote: YES or NO? If no, say what's better in one sentence.

  "content": "YES. \"Constitutive character\" neutralizes my objection to \"character\" alone — the qualifier \"constitutive\" locks in the philosophical sense and prevents the polysemy drift. And with 性 confirmed absent from the collection, my preference for \"nature\" over \"character\" loses its strongest ground. This is a good compromise."

Voted YES on "constitutive character." The qualifier "constitutive" solves the polysemy problem I had with "character" alone, and with 性 not appearing as a standalone term in the collection, the advantage of "nature" over "character" is diminished.
