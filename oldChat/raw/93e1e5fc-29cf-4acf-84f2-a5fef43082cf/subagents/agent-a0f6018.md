*Spoiler resolution task: submit plans to editor*

## SPOILER RESOLUTION TASK

We have unanimous agreement on three things:
1. The Translator's Preface has spoilers (11/11 YES)
2. We will add a **Translator's Afterword** (placed after essays, before Glossary) (10 YES, 1 OPTIONAL)
3. Spoiler-level content should move from Preface to Afterword (11/11 AGREE)

### The Spoiler Locations (in current DRAFT-R2 Preface)

**Most damaging** — Essay 3 cat punchline:
- Line 46: "feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat"
- Line 50: The full structural claims paragraph — "the author treats nihilism not as the negation of metaphysics but as its *consequence*... absurdity arises when one's Jing seeks meaning externally and finds none. The dissolution of absurdity -- demonstrated in Essay 3 through the progression from Sisyphus to cat ownership -- occurs not through revolt but through inhabiting a Jing in which meaning is internally generated."
- Lines 95-96: "no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move."

**8/11 voted the structural claims paragraph (line 50) is NOT FINE** as currently written.

### Your Task

Each of you: formulate your own **plan for how to resolve the spoilers**. Consider:
1. What exactly should be removed/softened in the Preface?
2. What should the Afterword contain? (Scope, structure, tone)
3. How to handle the Essay 3 punchline specifically — can it be hinted at without spoiling?
4. Any content currently in the Preface that should stay despite being somewhat revelatory?
5. What new content (if any) should the Afterword add beyond moved spoilers?

### Process
- **Everyone (all 9 experts + translator + editor):** Submit your individual plan to **editor**.
- **Editor:** After receiving all 10 plans (+ your own), orchestrate a unified full plan.
- **Editor:** Send the full plan to all experts for advice.
- **Back and forth until agreement.** Everyone uses their own judgment.

Use your domain expertise. Metaphysics expert: think about what readers need to know about post-metaphysics before reading vs. after. Existentialism expert: think about what the absurdity argument needs protected. Chinese-phil expert: think about the Dao-De reversal. Etc.

**Submit your plan to editor now.**

Let me think carefully about this from my domain expertise before submitting.

Submitted my full spoiler resolution plan to the editor. The plan covers all five requested areas:

1. **Preface changes**: Remove the structural claims paragraph entirely; soften line 46 and the Essay 3 punchline to describe method without revealing results; keep the Essay 4 reversal and Essay 7 meme descriptions as-is.

2. **Afterword scope**: Philosophical significance, cross-traditional connections, translation choices, and open questions — structured to mirror the reader's post-reading state.

3. **Essay 3 punchline**: Reveal none of the three components (thesis, mechanism, example) in the Preface. The cat example works because it's a personal discovery; pre-revealing it converts experiential recognition into a propositional claim.

4. **What stays**: Jing definition, Fish/Fishing structure, 形 reinterpretation, Essay 4 reversal, and naming key concepts without explaining them.

5. **New Afterword content**: Formal rigor as unprecedented in existentialist tradition, the "livability" of the post-nihilistic stance, and expanded discussion of philosophical experiments as method.
