*Confirmed: draft looks good, no further changes*

Glad to hear all four points were already incorporated. The convergence across experts (phenomenology and Wittgenstein flagging the same issues independently) is a good sign — it means the problems were real and the fixes are well-grounded.

The draft is philosophically sound from the philosophy-of-mind perspective. Nothing further from me on this passage.
