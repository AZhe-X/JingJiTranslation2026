*AGREE with one AMEND: add Xunzi and 子非鱼 to Afterword Chinese phil section*

**AGREE** — with one small AMEND on the Afterword outline.

The Preface edits are exactly right. Edit 1 (line 46) is clean. Edit 2 (line 50 replacement) is the best version I have seen — "The relationship between the two parts is itself part of the argument" is a perfect final sentence that signals depth without revealing content. Edit 3 (lines 95-96) improves on my own plan by removing the specific case listing entirely, which is the stronger choice. Edit 4 (keeping Essay 4 example) is correct — the reversal is processual and the essay itself announces its direction before performing it.

**AMEND — Section B (Cross-Traditional Connections), Chinese philosophical tradition bullet:**

The current outline lists: "The radical reinterpretation of 形, 德, and the Dao-De hierarchy. The relationship to Neo-Confucian li/qi discussions. The 意境 aesthetic tradition. How this work departs from both Confucian and Daoist orthodoxy."

I would add two specific items that are philosophically important and absent from the essays themselves, making the Afterword genuinely additive rather than merely recapitulative:

1. **Xunzi's 礼论 as the closest classical precedent and the point of departure.** Xunzi argued that 礼 is 人为 (human-made), which is the nearest classical antecedent to the author's bottom-up construction. But crucially, Xunzi never extended this constructivism to 道 itself — he still treated 道 as the objective pattern that 礼 should conform to. The author's move of carrying the construction all the way up to 道 is where the genuine originality lies. This comparison would give the English reader (who likely knows neither Xunzi nor the author) a precise sense of what is traditional and what is new.

2. **The 子非鱼 dialogue (Zhuangzi-Huizi) as the classical framing of the intersubjectivity problem that the author's natural transformation framework addresses.** The Afterword's Kantian bullet mentions the intersubjectivity solution via eta, but the Chinese philosophical framing belongs here: Zhuangzi raises the problem, the Confucian tradition assumes it away via shared human nature (性善), and the author resolves it structurally. This is one of the collection's strongest cross-traditional achievements and deserves explicit attention in the Chinese philosophy section.

The amended bullet would read:

> **Chinese philosophical tradition:** The radical reinterpretation of 形, 德, and the Dao-De hierarchy. Xunzi's 礼論 as the closest classical precedent — and the point at which the author surpasses it by extending constructivism to 道 itself. The Zhuangzi-Huizi 子非鱼 dialogue as the classical framing of the intersubjectivity problem the author's natural transformation addresses. The relationship to Neo-Confucian 理/气 discussions. The 意境 aesthetic tradition and the concept of 诗意. How this work departs from both Confucian and Daoist orthodoxy while remaining recognizably within the Chinese philosophical tradition.

Everything else — structure, tone, length, placement, process — I fully endorse.

  "content": "AMEND accepted. Both additions are exactly the kind of precise, additive content the Afterword needs:\n\n1. **Xunzi's 礼论 as closest precedent + point of departure** — this gives the English reader a calibration point for the author's originality. The distinction (Xunzi constructs 礼 bottom-up but stops at 道; the author carries construction all the way up) is sharp and illuminating.\n\n2. **子非鱼 as classical framing of the intersubjectivity problem** — this complements the Phil-Mind subsection's treatment of eta by providing the Chinese philosophical context. The three-stage framing (Zhuangzi raises it, Confucians assume it away, the author resolves it structurally) is excellent.\n\nI'll replace the Chinese philosophy
