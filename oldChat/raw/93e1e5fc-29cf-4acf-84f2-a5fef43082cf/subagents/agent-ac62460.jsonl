No \"phenomenal X\" compounds. Clean parallel structure. Good.\n- **Line 38 (building the phenomenal chain):** This is where it should start accumulating. Currently one long paragraph with the \"phenomenal X\" terms building up. The em dashes already help with breathing. The density peaks at the full chain: \"phenomenal humaneness generates phenomenal rightness, which in turn generates phenomenal ritual conduct.\" This is correct — the crescendo peak.\n- **Line 40 (the 德 transition):** Short, clean. Good contrast after the dense paragraph. Acts as a hinge.\n- **Line 42 (inference paragraph):** Dense again — this is the mirror image, showing the reversal from the phenomenal side. The sentence split (DRAFT-R1) already helps. But this paragraph should be slightly less dense than line 38 since the reader already knows the terms.\n- **Line 44 (property → definition):** The three-step can/should/must logic is clear. This is the most readable paragraph in the draft — the Editor confirmed this.\n- **Line 46 (the reversal):** \"Thus the entire logical order is reversed.\" — Stark, clean, decisive. This IS the moment of contrast. It already works.\n- **Line 48 (closing):** Light, reflective. Good resolution.\n\nThe crescendo principle is already largely achieved in DRAFT-R1. The density peaks in line 38, the reversal in line 46 is stark by contrast. The main question is whether line 42 (the inference paragraph) is still too uniformly heavy. Let me check it more carefully.\n\nLooking at line 42 in DRAFT-R1: after the sentence split, the paragraph now has clearer internal pacing. The key claim about the self/other gap lands well.
