If any of us domain experts does the writing, there is a real risk of over-interpreting the text through our own tradition's lens.

They would need to rely heavily on the rest of us for Western philosophical terminology, but the foundation of good translation is understanding the source.\n\n**Self-recommendation:**\n\nI do not self-recommend as primary translator. My strength is in identifying phenomenological resonances and providing precise Western philosophical equivalents, but I would risk over-phenomenologizing the text. For example, I might be tempted to render 第一实在 as \"originary givenness\" rather than the more neutral \"first reality\" -- which would be an interpretive choice that imports Husserlian connotations the author may not intend. I am better positioned as a consultant than as the primary voice.\n\nThat said, I rank myself third because if the choice must fall to a domain expert, phenomenology has the broadest overlap with the author's framework (the primacy of phenomena, constitution, lived experience, the poetic).
