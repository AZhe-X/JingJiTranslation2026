This is an excellent draft. Let me also consult the Essay 4 translation and the source material for reference before sending detailed feedback.

Feedback sent. I identified:

- **2 substantive corrections**: the Husserl Erscheinung/Phänomen conflation in the Phenomena section, and the Diamond Sutra reference importing Madhyamaka ontology the author doesn't commit to
- **1 substantive addition**: the other-minds dimension of the Essay 4 argument (first-person/third-person asymmetry in access to mental states)
- **1 strengthening suggestion**: explaining WHY experiential fidelity trumps literal accuracy (it's methodological, not stylistic)
- **Several minor refinements** on the Heidegger comparison, the "vocation" phrasing, and positive notes on what's already well-handled

No factual errors from my domain. Awaiting next task.
