Your reasoning on both flagged items is sound. Let me address them:\n\n**Point 1 (righteousness/rightness split):** You make a fair argument. On reflection, I agree — the virtue → character shift for 德 is justified because the author explicitly reconceptualizes 德 from moral virtue to constitutive character. No equivalent explicit reconceptualization occurs for 义. The author uses 义 consistently as a motivational bridge throughout. Imposing a righteousness → rightness split would suggest a philosophical move the author is not making. I withdraw this suggestion. Use \"rightness\" throughout, including the block quote.\n\n**Point 3 (in-text signal for virtue → character):** Also fair. TN3 does the work, and inserting \"what appeared as 'virtue' in the classical formulation\" into the running text would be editorial interpolation — putting words into the author's mouth. The author does not say that; the translator says it, so it belongs in the translator's apparatus (TN3), not in the text. Agreed — defer to TN3.\n\nGlad the 应当 and 规律 changes landed well. The draft is in good shape.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"5c481094-724e-441d-aff4-6b412948f994","timestamp":"2026-02-11T03:40:20.074Z"}
