*梦境 contains 境 — should translation preserve this link?*

Question from the author: 梦境 contains the character 境 — the same 境 as in the title 境集 and the central concept 境 (Jing). But "dreamscape" (and most proposed translations) doesn't capture this connection. The reader of the English text would not see that 梦境 literally contains 境.

Does this matter? Should the translation of 梦境 somehow preserve the 境 connection? If so, how?

Brief responses welcome. This is a real translation problem.

This is an excellent question and it does matter. Let me think through it carefully.

Now let me check how 境 and 梦境 are actually used in the essays to ground this properly.

Good. Now I have the full picture. Let me send my response.

The author develops 梦境 as a *species* of 境 -- a dreamscape is a particular kind of Jing, one characterized by constructed immersion.

Message sent. My recommendation: keep "dreamscape" as the translation but add a translator's note on first occurrence that explicitly reveals the 梦 + 境 morphological link and its philosophical significance, then recall that connection when 境 is formally introduced later in Essay 6.
