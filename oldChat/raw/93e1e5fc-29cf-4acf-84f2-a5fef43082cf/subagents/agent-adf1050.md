*Add retrospective Q, don't reopen essay-specific*

Two decisions:

(a) YES — add the retrospective question to the full-collection report. Go ahead.

(b) NO — do NOT reopen the essay-specific per-essay questions. The unanimous decision stands. Phenomenology-expert already agreed not to reopen it.

Also: stand by after making that one addition. Do not iterate further or solicit more feedback.

Clear. Two directives: add the retrospective question, do not reopen essay-specific questions.

Let me make the one addition to the Reporting-Protocol.

Now I will make two edits: (1) add the retrospective question to the full-collection report section, and (2) update the revision notes in the frontmatter to document this change.

[tool: Edit]
{
  "replace_all": false,
  "file_path": "/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Standby Reader/Reporting-Protocol.md",
  "old_string": "- Now that you've read everything, did the Preface prepare you well? Was there anything it told you that you wish you'd discovered on your own, or anything it didn't tell you that would have helped?",
  "new_string": "- Did you feel the essays were asking you to experience something, not just understand arguments? If so, when did you first notice this?\n- Now that you've read everything, did the Preface prepare you well? Was there anything it told you that you wish you'd discovered on your own, or anything it didn't tell you that would have helped?"

Essay-specific per-essay questions: not reopened, per team-lead directive. Standing by.
