*Reminder: 文言 format applies to Laozi quote too*

Reminder from the author — we already agreed (10/10 unanimous) on the Classical Chinese Quotation Format:

1. Present original 文言 text as a **block quote**
2. Follow with **glossed English translation** — key terms glossed on first occurrence as "English (漢字, pinyin)", e.g., "humaneness (仁, ren)"
3. After first introduction, use **plain English only**
4. 现象X compounds keep "phenomenal" prefix always

This means for the Laozi block quote, the format would be:

> [Original Chinese block quote]
> "When the Way (道, dao) was lost there was virtue (德, de); when virtue was lost there was humaneness (仁, ren); when humaneness was lost there was rightness (义, yi); when rightness was lost there was ritual conduct (礼, li)."

Then in the author's analysis, plain English: "humaneness," "rightness," "ritual conduct" — with 德 shifting to "(constitutive) character" as decided.

Given THIS format — where the glossed English already includes the Chinese characters and pinyin at first occurrence — does the question of "the Way" vs "Dao" still matter? The reader sees "the Way (道, dao)" and has both. 

Reconsider your answer on 道 with this format in mind. Should it be "the Way (道, dao)" or "Dao (道)" in the glossed block quote? One word answer.

  "content": "\n**\"the Way (道, dao)\"** -- still yes. \"The Way\" gives the English reader immediate semantic content; the gloss provides the Chinese. In running text after, either \"the Way\" or \"Dao\" works depending on whether the author is referencing the Laozi's concept or using it as a structural term in the formal framework.\n",
  "summary": "Still \"the Way (道, dao)\" — immediate semantic content for reader"

Still "the Way (道, dao)" in the glossed block quote. The English gives immediate semantic content, the parenthetical gives the Chinese and romanization. In subsequent running text, "the Way" or "Dao" can be chosen based on whether the context is the Laozi's concept or the author's formal structural usage.
