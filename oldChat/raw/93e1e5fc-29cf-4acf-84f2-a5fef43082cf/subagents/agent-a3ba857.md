The author refines the format. Instead of "constitutive character" at first occurrence, use:

**(constitutive) character (德 De)**

The parentheses around "constitutive" visually signal that the qualifier is clarifying but will drop away. Then plain "character" in running text thereafter.

Compare:
- Option A: "constitutive character (德 De)" → then "character"
- Option B (author's proposal): "(constitutive) character (德 De)" → then "character"

The difference is subtle but Option B makes the shortening feel built-in from the start — the parentheses tell the reader "this word is here to help you, but it's not part of the term."

YES or NO? Brief response.

Voted YES on Option B. The parenthetical format communicates the shortening directly in the gloss itself, reducing the need for a separate translator's note.
