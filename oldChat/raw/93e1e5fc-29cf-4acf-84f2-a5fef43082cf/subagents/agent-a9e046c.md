*Vote on Afterword — yes/no/optional, with reasons*

ALL TEAM MEMBERS:

New question from the author: **Since we decided the work doesn't need an external introduction BEFORE the essays, should there be an Afterword AFTER the essays?**

For example, an editor's afterword, a translator's afterword, or a critical afterword that discusses the work's significance, connections to other traditions, etc. — placed AFTER the reader has completed the experiential sequences.

This would avoid the spoiler problem entirely (the reader has already experienced everything) while still providing the scholarly positioning, cross-traditional connections, and critical context that a Foreword would have provided.

Vote:
- **YES** — include an Afterword (say what kind)
- **NO** — not needed
- **OPTIONAL** — nice to have but not necessary

Brief reason (1-2 sentences).

The Preface orients the reader *before* reading; the Glossary Introduction explains terminological decisions; but neither can say \"here is where this work sits in relation to Heidegger's poetic dwelling, Kant's synthetic a priori, Madhyamaka emptiness, Wittgenstein's language games\" — because doing so before the reader has experienced the essays would impose external frameworks on phenomena, which is the very error the collection diagnoses. After the reader has completed all eight essays plus the Appendix, a Translator

Vote sent: **YES** for a Translator's Afterword. The key insight is that post-experience positioning avoids the spoiler problem entirely. After the reader has undergone all the experiential sequences, we can freely draw connections to Heidegger, Kant, Madhyamaka, Wittgenstein, etc. — because the reader now has the phenomenal ground to evaluate those comparisons on their own terms. It's a gift to the reader who has done the work, not a framework imposed before the phenomena.
