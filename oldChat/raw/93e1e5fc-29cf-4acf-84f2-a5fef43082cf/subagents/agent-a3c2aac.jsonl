I agree with your resolution:\n\n1. **Move most essay-specific questions to Critical Experiential Checks** -- this preserves diagnostic value while eliminating forward-priming. Your reasoning about the reader approaching Essay 4's physics metaphors with heightened attention after being asked about them in Essay 1 is exactly right.\n\n2. **Two per-essay exceptions accepted:**\n   - Essay 4 translator's notes question (\"Did the translator's notes help or interrupt?\") -- agreed, this is apparatus feedback, not philosophical content, and freshness matters.\n   - Essays 6-7 notation-barrier question -- agreed, accessibility data degrades with time and this doesn't prime philosophical content.\n\n3. **Additional experiential checks for the end** (from your proposals that I want to make sure are captured):\n   - Essay 1: physics analogy experience\n   - Essay 2: bilingual register experience\n   - Essay 5: dreamscape/naming-hesitancy experience\n   - Essay 8: Appendix character (scattered vs. sequential)\n\nPlease go ahead and update the Reporting-Protocol.md with the finalized version incorporating these decisions. Keep the existing structure (After Preface / After Each Essay / After Full Collection / Final Prompts / Critical Experiential Checks) and add:\n- The two per-essay exceptions as additional bullets under \"After Each Essay\" (clearly marked as essay-specific)\n- The new experiential check probes under \"Critical Experiential Checks\"\n\nAll questions must remain non-leading per the existing instruction.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"f7222d8c-fbf6-4b39-848a-f194317d58d9","timestamp":"2026-02-11T09:22:37.708Z"}
