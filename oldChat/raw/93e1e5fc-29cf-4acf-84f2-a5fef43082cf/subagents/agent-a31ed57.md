The constructivist inversion reads clearly, the 德 split (virtue → character) is well-executed with TN3, the property-to-definition reversal is captured in TN4, and the hyphenated \"meta-physics\" preserves the 元物理 etymological play. No outstanding objections.",

**CONFIRM** sent to team-lead. The revised draft is approved. The key elements are all in place: the 德 split, the consistent phenomenal-X terms, the "meta-physics" hyphenation for 元物理, the (德) callback at first analysis occurrence, and the well-crafted translator's notes. No objections.
