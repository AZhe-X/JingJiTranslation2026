*形而上: *

Quick question from the author on 形而上 (xing er shang):

The current dictionary entry has the main translation as "the metaphysical" (substantive adjective). The author is asking: should it be "the metaphysical" or "metaphysical object"?

Consider: the author uses 形而上 to refer to constructions built upon phenomena (形/现象) that claim constancy/universality — all Second Reality content. The formal definition: "a metaphysical m is an association in E, and m is a universal property in some subcategory of E."

Which rendering is better and why? Is there a context where one works better than the other? Keep your response concise.

They are patterns of constancy extracted from experience and then mistakenly reified as generators of experience (the 道德仁义礼 reversal). Calling them \"objects\" completes exactly the reification the author is warning against.\n\n\"The metaphysical\" as a substantive adjective preserves the right ambiguity: it names something without committing to what kind of thing it is.

"The metaphysical" wins over "metaphysical object" for two reasons: (1) "object" reifies what the author explicitly argues are constructions, completing the very reversal the 道德仁义礼 passage warns against; (2) in the formal framework, $m$ is a morphism/association, not a categorical object, so "object" misleads mathematically literate readers. The substantive adjective preserves the right ambiguity.
