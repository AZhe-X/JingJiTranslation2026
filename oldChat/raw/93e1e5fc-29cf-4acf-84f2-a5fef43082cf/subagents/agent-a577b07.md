*Review draft translation, send feedback to translator-2*

Please review the draft translation of the 道德仁义礼 passage from Essay 4 (后形而上学 整理).

**Original Chinese**: Read the original essay at: /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录/后形而上学 整理.md (lines 18-30 for the passage, and footnotes [^3], [^4], [^24] at lines 136-138, 172)

**Draft translation**: Read /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Draft/Essay4-DaoDeRenYiLi.md

Compare the draft against the original Chinese carefully. Then send your comments, suggestions, agreements, and any concerns **directly to translator-2** via message. Focus on your area of expertise (phenomenology) — whether the phenomenal/phenomena language is handled correctly, the phenomenal-X compounds, the first-person experiential descriptions.

Let me read both the original Chinese and the draft translation to provide informed feedback.

Now I have both texts. Let me do a careful phenomenological review of the draft translation against the original.

Overall this is strong work — the structure is clear, the phenomenal-X compounds are handled consistently, and the footnotes are well-translated. Here are my comments, focused on phenomenology-adjacent issues:\n\n---\n\n**1. GOOD: Phenomenal-X compounds are consistent and correct.**\nEvery 现象X compound is rendered as \"phenomenal X\" throughout — phenomenal ritual conduct, phenomenal humaneness, phenomenal rightness. No drops, no inconsistencies. This is exactly right.\n\n**2. GOOD: The Laozi block quote follows our agreed conventions.**\nStandard English with semantic weight, glossed format, Chinese + pinyin on first occurrence, TN1

Conventions correctly applied — phenomenal-X compounds consistent, Laozi block quote follows agreed format, 德 transition clean, TNs well-crafted.\n\n**Three main phenomenological concerns:**\n\n1. **\"feeling of concern for the other\"** (line 38) — interpretive overreach. The Chinese 感受 is deliberately vague; \"concern\" imports a Levinasian register. Should be: \"a feeling directed toward the other.\"\n\n2. **\"impels\"** — too causally strong. Original says 使得我想要 (\"makes me want to\"). \"Impels\" suggests mechanism, not phenomenal description. Should be: \"moves me to want to.\"\n\n3. **\"manifests in everyone around us\"** — \"m

Review complete. I sent detailed feedback directly to translator-2 with 10 specific points (7 positives, 3 concerns), plus a summary to the team lead. 

The three main phenomenological concerns are all about the same principle: maintaining the phenomenal register. The author is describing first-person experiential data, and three word choices — "concern for the other," "impels," and "manifests" — each import theoretical commitments (Levinasian ethics, causal mechanism, metaphysical revelation) that aren't in the Chinese source. The suggested revisions keep the translation at the descriptive level where the author operates.
