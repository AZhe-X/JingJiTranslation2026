Make your case, respond to the other positions, and see if you can reach consensus. Is the pejorative connotation of \"intoxicated\" a feature (the author IS describing a state of unknowing) or a bug (the author is not morally condemning pre-metaphysical existence)?\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"992bb836-8578-472f-93e6-f2a276862567","timestamp":"2026-02-11T00:37:44.710Z"}

The author chose 沉醉 over these alternatives deliberately.\n\n**The critical question -- feature or bug?**\n\nThe pejorative connotation is a **feature, but a mild one**. Here is why:\n\nIn classical Chinese philosophy, the dream-state (梦) is not morally condemned but it IS understood as epistemically inferior. Consider Zhuangzi's butterfly dream (庄周梦蝶): the dreamer is not doing anything wrong, but the dream-state is one of 不知 (bu zhi, \"not-knowing\") -- you do not know you are dreaming while you are in it. The 醉 in 沉醉 adds that this not-knowing is *pleasurable*, even *seductive*. You are not merely unaware; you are enjoying your unawareness. You are drunk on the dream.\n\nThis is precisely the Buddhist resonance with *mada* (intoxication, heedlessness) -- one of the *upakleshas*. The intoxicated person is not evil but is *heedless*, comfortable in ignorance.\n\n**Against \"absorbed\" and \"immersed\":**\n\n- \"Absorbed\" (phenomenology's position) maps well to Heidegger's *Verfallen* (falling/fallenness), but Heidegger himself insisted that *Verfallen* is not morally pejorative -- it is a structural feature of Dasein. If the author wanted that neutral structural sense, 沉浸 or 陷入 would have been the natural choice, not 沉醉.\n- \"Immersed\" loses both components: it captures neither the downward pull of 沉 (immersion implies horizontal entry into water, not sinking) nor the intoxication of 醉. It is the safest choice and therefore the least faithful.\n\n**My refined position:**\n\nUse \"intoxicated\" for 沉醉 and let the context do the work of showing this is not moral condemnation. The English word \"intoxicated\" can carry wonder and pleasure -- \"intoxicated by beauty,\" \"intoxicated with joy\" -- and does not always imply impairment in the pejorative sense. In the compound 沉醉的梦境, I would render this as \"the intoxicated dreamscape\" or \"the dreamscape of intoxication.\"\n\nIf the team finds \"intoxicated\" too strong, my compromise would be **\"entranced\"** rather than \"absorbed\" or \"immersed.\" \"Entranced\" preserves the altered-consciousness quality, the pleasurability, and the epistemic compromise without the strong connotation of impairment.
