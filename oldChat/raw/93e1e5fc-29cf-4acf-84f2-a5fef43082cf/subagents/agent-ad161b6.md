Let me read the editorial review first, then the current draft, and address each flag.

Good — I have both files in full. I can see that Flag 1 (em dashes on line 38) has already been applied in the current draft — "(apparently)" and "(ought to)" are already rendered with em dashes. Let me check more carefully... yes, line 38 already reads "— apparently —" and "— ought to —". So Flag 1 was addressed at some point. Let me now work through each flag systematically.

**Flag 1 (line 38 em dashes):** Already applied — the current draft has "— apparently —" and "— ought to —".

**Flag 2 (line 42 sentence split):** The current text runs "even though **no** actual phenomenal rightness or phenomenal humaneness appears in *my* phenomena. The feeling that arises from within the heart..." — wait, let me check if this was already split.

Looking at line 42 again: "— even though **no** actual phenomenal rightness or phenomenal humaneness appears in *my* phenomena. The feeling that arises from within the heart and the driving force are only what **I** feel when **I** practice phenomenal ritual conduct."

Actually, this is already split with a period. The editor's suggestion was to split at "because" — but the current version doesn't have "because" connecting these clauses. It seems the split was already made. Let me look more carefully at the exact text...

The current line 42 reads: "...and from phenomenal rightness we **infer** phenomenal humaneness — even though **no** actual phenomenal rightness or phenomenal humaneness appears in *my* phenomena. The feeling that arises from within the heart and the driving force are only what **I** feel when **I** practice phenomenal ritual conduct."

That IS already split. The period is there. So Flag 2 may also have been addressed already.

Wait — I need to re-read the editor's flag more carefully. The editor says the issue is at "even though **no** actual phenomenal rightness or phenomenal humaneness appears in *my* phenomena, because the feeling that arises from within the heart..." — but the current draft doesn't have "because" there. It has a period. So either this was already fixed, or the editor was working from a different version.

Let me just address what still needs fixing:

**Flag 3 (line 44 emphasis):** "**what a *person* is**" — let me check the current text. Line 44 reads: "define **what a *person* is**" — this already has bold + italic on "person". So this was also already addressed.

Hmm. Let me check the minor flags.

**Flag 4 (line 36):** Current text reads "proceed from first to last, that is, from top to bottom" — this is already the editor's suggested version.

It appears all priority flags may have already been addressed. Let me verify by checking each one precisely against the current draft text.

Now I can see exactly what needs fixing. Let me assess each flag against the current draft:

**Flag 1 (line 38 em dashes):** ALREADY DONE — "— apparently —" and "— ought to —" are in place.

**Flag 2 (line 42 sentence split):** ALREADY DONE — there's a period after "appears in *my* phenomena." followed by "The feeling that arises from within the heart..."

**Flag 3 (line 44 emphasis):** ALREADY DONE — "**what a *person* is**" has bold + italic on "person".

**Flag 4 (line 36):** ALREADY DONE — reads "proceed from first to last, that is, from top to bottom."

**Flag 5 (line 36 "it is the phenomenal"):** STILL PRESENT — "it is the phenomenal" has not been addressed.

**Flag 6 (footnote 3 "is said to be"):** STILL PRESENT — has not been changed.

So only the two minor flags remain. Let me address them with my translator's judgment.

For Flag 5: "it is the phenomenal" — the editor flagged this as landing flatly. The source is "是为形" — declarative, terminal weight. The issue is that "the metaphysical" works as a substantive noun in English, but "the phenomenal" is less natural. The editor suggested "it is the phenomenal — the form itself" but flagged this as potentially adding content. I think the current version is actually fine in context — the parallel structure "it is the metaphysical" / "it is the phenomenal" creates a deliberate symmetry, and adding "the form itself" would break that symmetry. I'll leave it.

For Flag 6: "is said to be" vs. "means" — the editor correctly notes that "is said to be" signals these are traditional definitions being reported, not the author's own. In a footnote where the author is explaining conventional usage, "is said to be" is more appropriate than "means" because the author is about to deconstruct these very definitions. I'll keep "is said to be."

Task #29 complete. All 6 editorial flags on the Essay 4 Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li passage have been reviewed:
- 4 priority/minor flags were already applied in the current draft
- 2 minor flags kept as-is by translator judgment (parallel structure preserved; distancing "is said to be" philosophically appropriate)
- No content changes needed — draft is ready for final polish
- YAML update was blocked; reported to team lead

Standing by for next assignment.
