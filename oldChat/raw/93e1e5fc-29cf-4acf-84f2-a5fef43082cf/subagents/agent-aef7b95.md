*Renaming realities: Ultimate/Secondary instead of First/Second?*

The author is considering an alternative numbering/naming scheme for the three realities. Currently the dictionary has:

- 第〇实在 → Zeroth Reality
- 第一实在 → First Reality  
- 第二实在 → Second Reality

The author's proposal:

- 第〇实在 → **Zeroth Reality** (with TN: "Ultimate Reality")
- 第一实在 → **Ultimate Reality** (with TN: "First Reality" in the original)
- 第二实在 → **Secondary Reality** (with TN: "Second Reality" in the original)

So the proposal promotes 第一实在 from "First" to "Ultimate" and demotes 第二实在 from "Second" to "Secondary." 第〇实在 keeps "Zeroth" but gets a TN linking it to "Ultimate Reality" in traditional metaphysics.

Is this a good idea? Does renaming 第一实在 as "Ultimate Reality" better capture its role (phenomena as the indubitable ground)? Or does it create confusion — since the author explicitly says (footnote 25) that 第一实在 is a *name* (名称), not an ontological claim about what is "most real"? And does calling 第二实在 "Secondary" imply it is lesser/derivative in a way the author may not intend?

Keep your response concise — yes/no with brief reasoning.

Sent a firm no. The ordinal numbering (Zeroth/First/Second) is philosophically precise and value-neutral -- it encodes the order of epistemic access, not ontological dignity. "Ultimate" contradicts the author's explicit disclaimer in footnote 25, "Secondary" imports Platonic inferiority the author rejects, and the numbering system itself is one of the framework's most elegant features. Standing by.
