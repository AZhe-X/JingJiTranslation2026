*Already submitted feedback — confirming key points*

Already submitted — my full feedback was sent to you earlier in this session. To confirm you have it, the key points were:

1. Do NOT add essay-specific questions to per-essay template (cross-essay priming risk)
2. Add Critical Experiential Checks for Essay 1 (physics analogy test) and Essay 5 (Poetic/dreamscape distinction)
3. Soften question 4 in per-essay template: change "Did you feel like the essay was asking you to *experience* something..." to "What was the essay asking you to do — understand an argument, experience something, or both? Did it succeed?"
4. Deliver Critical Checks sequentially (one at a time), not simultaneously
5. Confirmed "tell a friend" prompts as excellent

Let me know if you need anything else.
