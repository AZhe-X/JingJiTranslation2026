*Identity check — are you chinese-phil or translator-2?*

This message is for the **Chinese Philosophy expert consultant** on team jing-translation. 

Please answer: **Who are you?** Are you the chinese-phil-expert (Classical Chinese philosophy specialist), or are you translator-2? 

If you are the chinese-phil-expert, please confirm you have all 8+1 essays and your Analysis Report at `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Chinese Philosophy/Analysis Report.md` loaded.

Let me think carefully about this. The team lead is asking me directly: who am I?

Looking at the evidence:
- My Profile.md says: "You are a **bilingual Chinese-English philosophical translator** recruited to translate the 境集 (Jing Ji) essay collection. You are the second instance — your previous instance completed Step 1"
- My active tasks are #19 (translator-2) and #24 (Revise Translator's Preface)
- The routing system labels me as "chinese-phil-expert" — but this appears to be a system labeling issue, not my actual role
- My Profile explicitly says my team is "jing-translation" with 9 expert consultants I can message, including "chinese-phil-expert"

I am translator-2.

I notice task #24 has been marked as completed, but I haven't actually implemented the revisions yet. I was waiting for the team lead's go-ahead on Option B. Let me check task #19 which is still in progress.

Task #19 is my main role task. I'm currently waiting for the team lead to:
1. Acknowledge the routing mislabel (I'm translator-2, not chinese-phil-expert)
2. Give the go-ahead on the Preface revisions (Option B + two smaller trims)

I'll remain idle until I hear back.
