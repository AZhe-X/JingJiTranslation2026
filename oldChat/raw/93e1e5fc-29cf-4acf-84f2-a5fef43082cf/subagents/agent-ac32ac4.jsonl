The author's footnote explains:\n- 虚 = \"without real significance\" (没有实在意义的)\n- 妄 = \"arrogant, self-deceptive\" (自大且自我蒙蔽的)\n\nThis describes the stance of someone who claims to reject ALL dreamscapes/meaning-structures — the radical nihilist who insists nothing matters. The author argues this is impossible because we are constituted by feeling.\n\nMy concern: In Buddhist Chinese, 虚妄 is a well-established term meaning \"illusory, unreal\" (related to maya/幻). The Heart Sutra's 远离颠倒梦想 treats this kind of 妄 as delusion to be transcended. The author's usage is DIFFERENT — it's not about illusion but about the arrogant pretension of claiming to stand outside all meaning-structures.\n\n**Questions**:\n1. Can you confirm that the author's 虚妄 is NOT the Buddhist 虚妄? Are there any risks of conflation?\n2. Which English rendering best captures the author's personal coinage WITHOUT activating Buddhist \"delusion/illusion\" associations?\n\nOptions:\n1. **\"delusion\"** — too Buddhist (moha/痴), too passive, misses arrogance\n2. **\"vain presumption\"** — captures arrogance + emptiness, slightly archaic\n3. **\"vain delusion\"** — combines both, but redundant?\n4. **\"presumptuous emptiness\"** — captures both components, awkward\n5. **\"hollow arrogance\"** — right meaning, wrong register\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"7b58c1fd-b318-43ff-b1d9-2519a4366e2c","timestamp":"2026-02-10T22:28:04.968Z"}

Confirming: the author's 虚妄 is NOT the Buddhist 虚妄\n\n**Confirmed. These are distinct usages, and the risk of conflation is real and must be guarded against.**\n\n**Buddhist 虚妄.** In Buddhist Chinese, 虚妄 (Sanskrit: *mṛṣā*, *vitatha*, or loosely *māyā*) means \"illusory, false, unreal\" -- characterizing the nature of phenomena or cognition. Key usages:\n\n- 虚妄分别 (*abhūta-parikalpa* / *vitatha-vikalpa*): \"false discrimination\" -- the Yogacara term for the cognitive activity that projects imagined natures onto the dependently arisen. This is a technical term for a specific cognitive error.\n- The Heart Sutra's 远离颠倒梦想 uses 梦想 (dream-thinking) and 颠倒 (inversion/viparyāsa) in the same semantic neighborhood. 妄 in Buddhist usage is about *cognitive error regarding the nature of reality* -- taking what is empty for substantial, taking what is impermanent for permanent.\n- Crucially, Buddhist 虚妄 is *descriptive of how things are experienced* (i.e., our cognition is 虚妄 because it projects inherent existence where there is none). It is NOT a moral judgment about the person experiencing it.\n\n**The author's 虚妄.** The author's footnote makes the divergence explicit:\n- 虚 = without real significance (没有实在意义的) -- this is close to the Buddhist sense of 虚 (empty/insubstantial)\n- 妄 = arrogant, self-deceptive (自大且自我蒙蔽的) -- this is NOT the Buddhist sense. Buddhist 妄 is *error*, not *arrogance*. The author's 妄 adds a moral-existential dimension: the person who claims to reject all meaning is not merely mistaken but *presumptuous* -- they pretend to occupy a standpoint (outside all dreamscapes) that is impossible for a feeling being.\n\nSo: the author's 虚妄 shares the 虚 component with Buddhist usage (insubstantiality) but diverges sharply on 妄 (arrogant pretension vs. cognitive error). The compound as a whole describes a *stance* (the radical nihilist's posture), not a *condition* (the nature of cognition).\n\n**Risk of conflation.** High for any reader with Buddhist background. If 虚妄 is rendered as \"delusion\" or \"illusion,\" a Buddhist-literate reader will immediately read it as *mṛṣā/vitatha* -- cognitive error about the nature of reality -- and completely miss the author's point about arrogant pretension. This would be a serious mistranslation because the author is *critiquing* the nihilist, not describing a universal cognitive condition.\n\n### 2. Recommended rendering: \"vain presumption\"\n\nOf your five options, **\"vain presumption\"** is the best. Here is my assessment of each:\n\n**\"delusion\"** -- Reject. As you noted, this is *moha* (痴) or *viparyāsa* (颠倒) in Buddhist English. It implies passive cognitive error. The author's 虚妄 is an *active stance* -- the nihilist *claims* to stand outside meaning. \"Delusion\" makes it sound like something that happens to you; the author means something you do to yourself through arrogance.\n\n**\"vain presumption\"** -- Recommend. \"Vain\" captures 虚 beautifully: it means both \"empty/without substance\" (vain effort, in vain) AND \"conceited/self-important\" (vanity, vainglory). This double meaning in English mirrors the author's double meaning in Chinese. \"Presumption\" captures 妄 as arrogance: to presume is to claim a right or position one does not actually hold. \"Vain presumption\" together means: an empty, self-important claim to a standpoint one cannot actually occupy. This is exactly the author's meaning. The slight archaism is appropriate -- the author's own register in this passage is elevated and deliberate (this is the essay on poeticality, not the cat essay).\n\n**\"vain delusion\"** -- Reject. Not merely redundant but actively confusing: \"delusion\" pulls toward the Buddhist reading, \"vain\" tries to pull away from it. The reader would not know which connotation to trust.\n\n**\"presumptuous emptiness\"** -- Reject. Awkward, and \"emptiness\" is the most dangerous word in any text with Buddhist resonances. 空 (sunyata) = emptiness is THE central Buddhist concept. Using \"emptiness\" here would create a false link between the nihilist's stance and sunyata, which is precisely the conflation the author's entire post-metaphysical framework is designed to prevent.\n\n**\"hollow arrogance\"** -- Close but wrong register. \"Hollow\" captures 虚 but sounds colloquial/journalistic (\"hollow promises,\" \"hollow victory\"). The author's footnote is precise and philosophical. \"Hollow arrogance\" belongs in a newspaper editorial, not a philosophical essay on poeticality.\n\n### Additional note for the translator\n\nSince the author provides their own footnote defining 虚妄, I would recommend preserving the footnote in translation and rendering it something like:\n\n> *虚妄*: a term coined by the author. 虚 (*xū*): without real substance; 妄 (*wàng*): arrogant and self-deceptive. Here translated as \"vain presumption\" -- the empty pretension of claiming to stand outside all meaning-structures. Note: this is distinct from the Buddhist term 虚妄 (*mṛṣā*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption.\n\nThis preempts the conflation problem directly. Any reader with Buddhist training will appreciate the disambiguation; any reader without it will simply register the definition and move on.\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":650,"cache_read_input_tokens":133807,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":650},"output_tokens":20,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY1BDAaYNBMT2jtXm25qZ","type":"assistant","uuid":"dc44a9ed-632f-4969-97b8-56f26eecf4b6","timestamp":"2026-02-10T22:28:42.422Z"}
