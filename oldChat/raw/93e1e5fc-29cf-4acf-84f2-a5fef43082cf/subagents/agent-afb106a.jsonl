Legenravend/49 Workspace/Standby Reader/Reporting-Protocol.md`. All 11 votes were APPROVE (with amendments incorporated). Here is a summary of what changed and what was kept.\n\n---\n\n### Changes from the original protocol\n\n**After the Preface (5 questions, was 3):**\n- Original 3 questions kept\n- ADDED: \"Based on the preface alone, what kind of reading experience are you expecting?\" (baseline expectation — editor proposal)\n- ADDED: \"Is there anything from the Preface that you're now anticipating or looking for in the essays?\" (anticipation-detection / spoiler test — epistemology-expert proposal)\n\n**After Each Essay (now 3 steps, was a flat list of 5 questions):**\n- Step 1: Request marginal notes before questions (\"If you made any marks or notes while reading, please share them now — even brief ones.\") — editor proposal, buddhism-expert revised framing\n- Step 2: 7 general questions (was 5):\n  - Q1-Q3 unchanged\n  - Q4 REWORDED: \"How would you describe what this essay was asking you to do — follow an argument? Notice something? Something else?\" (replaces the priming \"experience vs. argument\" wording — epistemology-expert proposal. This resolves the deferral question: softened wording can be asked after every essay, including Part 1)\n  - Q5 ADDED: \"Did anything in this essay remind you of something from your own life or experience?\" (chinese-phil-expert proposal)\n  - Q6-Q7 SPLIT from original Q5: \"Did you want to keep reading after this essay?\" + \"Were there any passages where your attention flagged or you had to push through?\" (editor proposal)\n- Step 3: Apparatus questions for specific essays only:\n  - Essay 4: \"Did the translator's notes help or interrupt your reading?\" (metaphysics-expert proposal)\n  - Essays 6-7: \"Were there passages where the notation felt like a barrier? If so, did the examples nearby help you through?\" (chinese-phil-expert + metaphysics-expert independent convergence)\n\n**After Full Collection (5 questions, was 4; word count replaces page count):**\n- Q1 unchanged\n- Q2 REWORDED: \"stayed with you most / didn't fully land\" replaces \"worked best and worst\" (editor proposal)\n- Q3-Q4 unchanged\n- Q5 ADDED: Preface retrospective (\"Now that you've read everything, did the Preface prepare you well?...\") — chinese-phil-expert + metaphysics-expert convergence\n- \"300-600 words\" replaces \"1-2 pages\" (metaphysics-expert proposal)\n\n**Final Prompts: Unchanged.** All three prompts kept as-is.\n\n**Critical Experiential Checks (8 probes, was 3):**\n- Essay 1 ADDED: Physics comparison — editor + metaphysics + epistemology convergence\n- Essay 2 ADDED: Three Bob scenarios — epistemology-expert proposal\n- Essay 3 unchanged\n- Essay 4 unchanged\n- Essay 5 ADDED: Two kinds of dreamscapes — chinese-phil + metaphysics + epistemology convergence (chinese-phil-expert wording selected)\n- Essay 6 ADDED: Magic books + Ship of Theseus — editor + metaphysics + epistemology convergence\n- Essay 7 REFINED: \"what was the difference in your experience of reading them?\" (epistemology-expert refinement)\n- Appendix ADDED: Coin-flipping + everyday activities — editor proposal\n- Non-leading principle reinforced with specific instruction not to name the Essay 7 sentences (wittgenstein-expert principle)\n\n**New section: Optional Re-read Test (Essay 3):**\n- \"If you re-read just the final example in Essay 3, does it produce the same experience as it did the first time?\" — epistemology-expert proposal. Marked as optional/experimental.\n\n**New section: Internal Analysis Notes:**\n- 4 notes for the team: Essay 5-6 transition flag, Essay 2 register test, marginal notes weighting, Preface spoiler cross-check\n\n---\n\n### What was NOT added (unanimous)\n\n- NO essay-specific per-essay questions (except the two apparatus/accessibility exceptions above). All essay-specific probing happens in the Critical Experiential Checks at the end, after all reading is complete. This was the clearest consensus item across all submissions.\n\n---\n\n### Attribution\n\nEvery change traces to at least one named team member's proposal, with most items supported by independent convergence across 2-3 submissions. The revision history is in the file's YAML frontmatter.\n\nThe protocol is now **FINAL (pending implementation)**. Ready for the standby reader whenever we have finished drafts to test.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"ecb8bc94-eee4-4c47-931f-cd32991dac2d","timestamp":"2026-02-11T08:53:00.128Z"}
