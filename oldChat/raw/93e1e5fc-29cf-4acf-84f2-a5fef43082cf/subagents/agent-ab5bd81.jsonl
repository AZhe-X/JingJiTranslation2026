The staged delivery (Preface -> per-essay -> collection-level -> final prompts -> critical experiential checks) correctly orders the questioning from open to targeted, preventing earlier questions from contaminating later responses. The \"delivery rule\" at the top and the \"non-leading\" instruction at the bottom are exactly right.\n\n### On Essay-Specific Questions\n\nTeam-lead asked us to consider whether to add essay-specific questions alongside the generic per-essay template. My recommendation: **Yes, but with strict constraints.**\n\n**The risk:** Essay-specific questions can prime the reader. If after Essay 2 we ask \"Did you notice anything about the three Bob examples?\", the reader who hasn't particularly noticed will now retroactively construct a narrative about them. This is the same contamination problem that led us to extract this file.\n\n**The solution:** Essay-specific questions should be:\n1. **Delivered ONLY as part of the Critical Experiential Checks at the very end** (after all general reporting is done), not after each individual essay.\n2. **Non-leading** — ask about the reader's experience, not about the essay's argument.\n3. **Limited to essays with clearly designed experiential sequences** — not every essay needs one.\n\nWe already have checks for Essays 3, 4, and 7. Here are my recommendations for the remaining essays:\n\n**Essay 1 (Collective Interest):** Add a check: \"In the first essay, the author compares collective interest to ocean waves. Did this comparison change how you think about the relationship between individuals and groups?\" — This tests whether the renormalization analogy produced a conceptual shift. Relatively low-risk because it names the analogy (which the reader has already encountered) without suggesting a conclusion.\n\n**Essay 2 (A Thought on Knowledge):** Add a check: \"In the second essay, there were three scenarios involving Bob. What stood out to you about them?\" — This tests whether the third Bob (emotional reverie, no belief formed) produced the key recognition that phenomena do not automatically become beliefs. The question is non-leading: it asks what stood out, not what should have stood out. This is epistemologically the most important check after the Essay 3 check, because the digestion argument is the linchpin of the access argument.\n\n**Essay 5 (Poetics/诗意):** Add a check: \"The author introduces the idea of 'dreamscapes' — lucid and intoxicated. Did this distinction resonate with anything in your own experience?\" — Tests whether the lucid/intoxicated distinction was experientially grounded rather than merely understood propositionally.\n\n**Essay 6 (Category Theory and Jing):** Add a check: \"Were there moments in the category theory essay where the magic book examples helped you understand something the notation alone didn't? Or vice versa?\" — Tests the crucial claim that the examples carry the philosophical content independently of the formalism.\n\n**Essay 8 (Appendix/Scattered Thoughts):** No specific check needed — it is supplementary.\n\n### Specific Suggestions on Existing Content\n\n1. **After the Preface (lines 18-20):** The question \"Did it tell you too much, too little, or about the right amount?\" is excellent — this directly tests our spoiler resolution work. Consider adding: \"Is there anything from the Preface that you're now anticipating or looking for in the essays?\" This would detect whether any residual spoilers in DRAFT-R3 are creating expectation bias.\n\n2. **Per-essay question (line 31):** \"Did you feel like the essay was asking you to *experience* something rather than just understand an argument? Did it work?\" — This is slightly leading. The italicized *experience* primes the reader to frame their report in experiential terms. Consider softening to: \"How would you describe what this essay was asking you to do — follow an argument? Notice something? Something else?\" This opens the same territory without presupposing the answer.\n\n3. **Critical Experiential Checks (lines 61-63):** These are well-crafted. The Essay 3 check (\"What happened to your experience across the three examples?\") is perfect — it asks about the trajectory of experience without naming any outcome. The Essay 4 check is similarly good. The Essay 7 check could be slightly more specific without being leading: \"When you encountered the two contrasting sentences, what was the difference in your experience of reading them?\" — This still asks about experience but points to the contrast, which is where the eta/natural-transformation insight lives.\n\n### One Structural Suggestion\n\nConsider adding a **re-read prompt** for Essay 3 in the Critical Experiential Checks: \"If you re-read just the final example in Essay 3, does it produce the same experience as it did the first time?\" This tests whether the experiential sequence is order-dependent (as the author claims) — a reader who has already been through the full sequence might find the final example still works on re-reading, or might find that the recognition has already been absorbed and no longer arrives with the same force. Either result is informative.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe protocol is strong as-is. My main recommendations: (1) add essay-specific checks for Essays 1, 2, 5, and 6, delivered only at the end alongside the existing checks for 3, 4, and 7; (2) soften the per-essay \"experience\" question to avoid priming; (3) add a Preface anticipation-detection question; (4) consider a re-read prompt for Essay 3.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"afddb057-80de-4fd4-bcad-b1c3a5fa754f","timestamp":"2026-02-11T08:51:17.293Z"}
