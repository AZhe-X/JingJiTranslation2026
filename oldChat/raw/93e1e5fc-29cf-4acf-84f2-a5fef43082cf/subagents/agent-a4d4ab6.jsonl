The reader encounters five opaque foreign terms in a sequence. The \"philosophical experiment\" (where the reader first accepts a conventional understanding, then watches it get deconstructed) CANNOT work, because the reader never had a conventional understanding to begin with. The romanized terms have very few morphisms in their Jing — they are semantically empty for the English reader.\n\nThe experiment requires the reader to FEEL something when they read \"virtue,\" \"humaneness,\" \"righteousness\" — to bring their own associations — and THEN experience the reversal. If they just see \"De, Ren, Yi, Li,\" they have nothing to reverse. The passage becomes an abstract report about foreign concepts rather than a lived philosophical experience.\n\nDoes this change your thinking? Should we use English translations (the Way, virtue, humaneness, rightness, ritual conduct) in the block quote precisely SO the philosophical experiment works on the English reader?\n\nReconsider.
