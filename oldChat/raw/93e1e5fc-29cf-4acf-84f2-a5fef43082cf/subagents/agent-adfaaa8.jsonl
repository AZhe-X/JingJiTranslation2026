The author is asking: should it be \"the metaphysical\" or \"metaphysical object\"?\n\nConsider: the author uses 形而上 to refer to constructions built upon phenomena (形/现象) that claim constancy/universality — all Second Reality content. The formal definition: \"a metaphysical m is an association in E, and m is a universal property in some subcategory of E.\"\n\nWhich rendering is better and why? Is there a context where one works better than the other? Keep your response concise.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"4864debc-4e2b-469a-b9bc-a7a4b1498cf6","timestamp":"2026-02-10T23:13:19.830Z"}
