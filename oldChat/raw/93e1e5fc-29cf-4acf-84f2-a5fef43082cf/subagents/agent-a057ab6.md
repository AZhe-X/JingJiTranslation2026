*形而上: *

Quick question from the author on 形而上 (xing er shang):

The current dictionary entry has the main translation as "the metaphysical" (substantive adjective). The author is asking: should it be "the metaphysical" or "metaphysical object"?

Consider: the author uses 形而上 to refer to constructions built upon phenomena (形/现象) that claim constancy/universality — all Second Reality content. The formal definition: "a metaphysical m is an association in E, and m is a universal property in some subcategory of E."

Which rendering is better and why? Is there a context where one works better than the other? Keep your response concise.

In the 后形而上学 essay, 形而上 refers to any understanding/interpretation/construction built *upon* phenomena. It

Sent my assessment. "The metaphysical" is better as the default because 形而上 is grammatically relational (above form), not substantive (a thing). It shifts to "a metaphysical" (count noun) only in the category theory formal definitions. "Metaphysical object" should be avoided -- "object" imports the ontological weight the author is explicitly deconstructing.
