The Afterword blueprint is comprehensive and well-structured. My three amendments from the previous round — the intoxicated/lucid dreamscape as resolution of the bad faith/authenticity problematic, the critique of Being-toward-death, and the intersubjectivity solution via eta — are all incorporated. The \"livability\" point is correctly placed in the existentialist positioning section. No further objections.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"1f71132c-f4e1-4235-9851-0be0fce7b1f4","timestamp":"2026-02-11T07:53:08.064Z"}
