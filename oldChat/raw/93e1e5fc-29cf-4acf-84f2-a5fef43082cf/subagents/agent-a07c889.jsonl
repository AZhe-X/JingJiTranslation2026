Confirming: the author's 虚妄 is NOT the Buddhist 虚妄\n\n**Confirmed. These are distinct usages, and the risk of conflation is real and must be guarded against.**\n\n**Buddhist 虚妄.** In Buddhist Chinese, 虚妄 (Sanskrit: *mṛṣā*, *vitatha*, or loosely *māyā*) means \"illusory, false, unreal\" -- characterizing the nature of phenomena or cognition. Key usages:\n\n- 虚妄分别 (*abhūta-parikalpa* / *vitatha-vikalpa*): \"false discrimination\" -- the Yogacara term for the cognitive activity that projects imagined natures onto the dependently arisen. This is a technical term for a specific cognitive error.\n- The Heart Sutra's 远离颠倒梦想 uses 梦想 (dream-thinking) and 颠倒 (inversion/viparyāsa) in the same semantic neighborhood. 妄 in Buddhist usage is about *cognitive error regarding the nature of reality* -- taking what is empty for substantial, taking what is impermanent for permanent.\n- Crucially, Buddhist 虚妄 is *descriptive of how things are experienced* (i.e., our cognition is 虚妄 because it projects inherent existence where there is none). It is NOT a moral judgment about the person experiencing it.\n\n**The author's 虚妄.** The author's footnote makes the divergence explicit:\n- 虚 = without real significance (没有实在意义的) -- this is close to the Buddhist sense of 虚 (empty/insubstantial)\n- 妄 = arrogant, self-deceptive (自大且自我蒙蔽的) -- this is NOT the Buddhist sense. Buddhist 妄 is *error*, not *arrogance*. The author's 妄 adds a moral-existential dimension: the person who claims to reject all meaning is not merely mistaken but *presumptuous* -- they pretend to occupy a standpoint (outside all dreamscapes) that is impossible for a feeling being.\n\nSo: the author's 虚妄 shares the 虚 component with Buddhist usage (insubstantiality) but diverges sharply on 妄 (arrogant pretension vs. cognitive error). The compound as a whole describes a *stance* (the radical nihilist's posture), not a *condition* (the nature of cognition).\n\n**Risk of conflation.** High for any reader with Buddhist background. If 虚妄 is rendered as \"delusion\" or \"illusion,\" a Buddhist-literate reader will immediately read it as *mṛṣā/vitatha* -- cognitive error about the nature of reality -- and completely miss the author's point about arrogant pretension. This would be a serious mistranslation because the author is *critiquing* the nihilist, not describing a universal cognitive condition.\n\n### 2. Recommended rendering: \"vain presumption\"\n\nOf your five options, **\"vain presumption\"** is the best. Here is my assessment of each:\n\n**\"delusion\"** -- Reject. As you noted, this is *moha* (痴) or *viparyāsa* (颠倒) in Buddhist English. It implies passive cognitive error. The author's 虚妄 is an *active stance* -- the nihilist *claims* to stand outside meaning. \"Delusion\" makes it sound like something that happens to you; the author means something you do to yourself through arrogance.\n\n**\"vain presumption\"** -- Recommend. \"Vain\" captures 虚 beautifully: it means both \"empty/without substance\" (vain effort, in vain) AND \"conceited/self-important\" (vanity, vainglory). This double meaning in English mirrors the author's double meaning in Chinese. \"Presumption\" captures 妄 as arrogance: to presume is to claim a right or position one does not actually hold. \"Vain presumption\" together means: an empty, self-important claim to a standpoint one cannot actually occupy. This is exactly the author's meaning. The slight archaism is appropriate -- the author's own register in this passage is elevated and deliberate (this is the essay on poeticality, not the cat essay).\n\n**\"vain delusion\"** -- Reject. Not merely redundant but actively confusing: \"delusion\" pulls toward the Buddhist reading, \"vain\" tries to pull away from it. The reader would not know which connotation to trust.\n\n**\"presumptuous emptiness\"** -- Reject. Awkward, and \"emptiness\" is the most dangerous word in any text with Buddhist resonances. 空 (sunyata) = emptiness is THE central Buddhist concept. Using \"emptiness\" here would create a false link between the nihilist's stance and sunyata, which is precisely the conflation the author's entire post-metaphysical framework is designed to prevent.\n\n**\"hollow arrogance\"** -- Close but wrong register. \"Hollow\" captures 虚 but sounds colloquial/journalistic (\"hollow promises,\" \"hollow victory\"). The author's footnote is precise and philosophical. \"Hollow arrogance\" belongs in a newspaper editorial, not a philosophical essay on poeticality.\n\n### Additional note for the translator\n\nSince the author provides their own footnote defining 虚妄, I would recommend preserving the footnote in translation and rendering it something like:\n\n> *虚妄*: a term coined by the author. 虚 (*xū*): without real substance; 妄 (*wàng*): arrogant and self-deceptive. Here translated as \"vain presumption\" -- the empty pretension of claiming to stand outside all meaning-structures. Note: this is distinct from the Buddhist term 虚妄 (*mṛṣā*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption.\n\nThis preempts the conflation problem directly. Any reader with Buddhist training will appreciate the disambiguation; any reader without it will simply register the definition and move on.\n\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"977120e4-f067-441a-8ac2-67a9b4e0cd81","timestamp":"2026-02-10T22:28:42.891Z"}
