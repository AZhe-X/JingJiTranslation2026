*Vote: draft Translator's Preface now or after?*

The author asks: should the translator write a draft of the Translator's Preface NOW (before full translation begins) to capture all the decisions while they're fresh — with the understanding it will be revised after translation is complete? Or should we wait until after?

Reply "NOW" or "AFTER" with a brief reason.

This message appears to be a stale/duplicate of the earlier exchange -- I already received the instruction to write the Preface draft NOW, wrote it, and sent confirmation to the team lead. Let me respond accordingly.

Responded to the team lead. The draft Translator's Preface is already complete and waiting for review. I'm idle and ready for the next instruction.
