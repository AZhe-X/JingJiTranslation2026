Question about the meme sentence in K1策略.\n\nIn K1策略, the author uses a Chinese internet meme sentence to demonstrate the FAILURE of natural transformation (eta) — the experience of not-understanding despite grammatical correctness:\n\n> \"你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国，记住我给出的原理\"\n\nThis sentence is a Chinese internet meme (deliberately incomprehensible absurdist humor). The philosophical point: the reader's mental simulation cannot align with the sentence's structural unfolding — eta fails, and the reader directly experiences \"I don't understand\" as a structural phenomenon.\n\nThe author contrasts this with \"猫跳上了桌子\" (the cat jumped on the table), where eta succeeds — the reader's mental simulation smoothly tracks the sentence.\n\n**Translation challenge**: How to handle this for English readers?\n\nOptions:\n1. **Translate literally** + translator's note explaining it's a meme. The literal English might be something like: \"You have such high-speed rotating machinery entering China, remember the principle I gave.\" This is weird in English but might not produce the *same kind* of incomprehension — it reads more like a bad translation than like a natively incomprehensible sentence.\n\n2. **Replace with an English equivalent meme** + note about the original. E.g., \"Has Anyone Really Been Far Even as Decided to Use Even Go Want to do Look More Like?\" (a famous English internet meme that is grammatically plausible but semantically void). This preserves the FUNCTION (eta-failure) but loses the specific Chinese text.\n\n3. **Keep Chinese text (romanized) + English equivalent + note**. Double presentation.\n\n4. **Translate literally and trust context**. The surrounding explanation will make clear that eta is failing.\n\nFrom your philosophy-of-language perspective: does the experiment's function (demonstrating eta-failure) require cultural recognition of the sentence as a meme, or just semantic incomprehension? Does it matter whether the English reader's experience of incomprehension is structurally identical to the Chinese reader's?\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"2d562314-e23d-4697-b424-72d95bb049e3","timestamp":"2026-02-10T22:27:01.311Z"}

Let me address the philosophical dimensions precisely.\n\n**The core question: what does the experiment require?**\n\nThe author uses the meme sentence to demonstrate a specific experiential phenomenon: the *failure* of eta --- the felt experience of reading a grammatically plausible sentence and being unable to construct the mental alignment that constitutes understanding. The experiment has two components:\n\n1. **The primary phenomenon**: eta-failure. The reader must *experience* not-understanding as a structural event, not just be told about it.\n\n2. **The secondary phenomenon** (introduced in the next paragraph): the author then says that if you learn the meme's cultural context through internet searching, you *can* obtain a kind of understanding --- but through the *cultural* category rather than the *grammatical* one. This demonstrates that eta can succeed in one categorical embedding while failing in another.\n\n**Does the experiment require cultural recognition?**\n\nNo, and this is crucial. The primary phenomenon (eta-failure) requires only semantic incomprehension --- the reader must encounter a sentence that is grammatically plausible but where mental simulation cannot track the structural unfolding. Cultural recognition as a meme is not necessary for this.\n\nHowever, the *secondary* phenomenon does require that the reader could *in principle* recover a kind of understanding through cultural context. This is what makes the meme sentence better than pure word-salad: it *has* meaning in a cultural register even though it lacks meaning in a grammatical register.\n\n**Does it matter whether the English reader's incomprehension is structurally identical to the Chinese reader's?**\n\nThis is where the author's own framework gives us the answer. Recall the structural verification criterion: we do not need ontological verification that two people have the *same* experience, only that their experiences occupy the *same structural position*. What matters is:\n\n- The English reader's experience of the substitute sentence occupies the position \"eta-failure in the grammatical/semantic category\"\n- The English reader could *in principle* learn the cultural context and shift to \"eta-success in the cultural category\"\n\nIf both conditions are met, the experiences are structurally commensurable regardless of whether the specific felt quality of Chinese-meme-incomprehension matches English-meme-incomprehension.\n\n**My recommendation: Option 2, with a specific modification.**\n\nReplace with the English meme, but present it in a way that preserves both phenomena. Something like:\n\n> [Main text]: ...when we cannot construct such a natural transformation --- for instance, when you read \"Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?\" and cannot complete a corresponding mental process to align with this sentence, you cannot obtain the feeling of \"I understand.\"\n\n> [Translator's note]: The original Chinese uses the internet meme \"你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国，记住我给出的原理,\" a deliberately absurdist sentence from Chinese internet culture that is grammatically plausible but semantically void. The English equivalent used here serves the same structural function. The author's subsequent point --- that understanding *can* be recovered through cultural context (learning the meme's origin and usage) even when grammatical comprehension fails --- applies equally to both sentences.\n\n**Why not the other options:**\n\n- **Option 1 (literal translation)** fails because, as you correctly identified, the English reads as a *bad translation* rather than as a natively incomprehensible sentence. The reader's experience would be \"I don't understand because this is poorly translated\" rather than \"I don't understand despite grammatical plausibility.\" These are *different structural positions* --- the first attributes the failure to the translation, the second to the sentence itself. The experiment requires the second.\n\n- **Option 3 (double presentation)** is viable but pedagogically cluttered. The passage is already dense with mathematical notation; adding romanized Chinese plus English equivalent plus note risks overwhelming the reader at exactly the moment when the text needs them to *have an experience*, not process metadata.\n\n- **Option 4 (literal + trust context)** has the same problem as Option 1. The surrounding explanation cannot compensate for the reader's experience being structurally wrong.\n\n**One additional consideration**: The \"Has anyone really been far\" meme is well-known in anglophone internet culture, which means some readers will *recognize* it and immediately shift to cultural understanding rather than experiencing the eta-failure first. If this is a concern, you could use a less famous but structurally equivalent English sentence --- something grammatically plausible but semantically void that most readers will not have encountered before. The philosophical requirement is: grammatically plausible, semantically untrackable, but possessing recoverable meaning in a cultural register.
