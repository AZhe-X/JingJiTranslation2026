*Is *

The author asks: would translating 德 as "virtue" risk large misleading interpretations for readers of 境集?

Context: Chinese-phil-expert recommends "virtue" as the default (it's the mainstream sinological standard), with "potency" in specifically Daoist passages, and a glossary/TN explaining the wider senses (moral virtue → natural potency → inherent character).

But the author's usage is constructivist — 德 in 境集 is not purely Confucian moral virtue nor purely Daoist natural potency. The worry: does "virtue" carry so much moral baggage in English that it would actively mislead readers about what the author means?

Please assess:
1. How misleading is "virtue" for 德 in this author's specific philosophical context?
2. Would an alternative (e.g., "de" romanized, "character," "potency") be less misleading, or would it create other problems?
3. Is the TN/glossary sufficient to correct any misleading impression, or is the word itself too loaded?

Give your honest assessment — the author wants to know if "virtue" is safe or dangerous here.

Argued strongly against "virtue" for this author's usage of 德. The author explicitly generalizes 德 beyond the human and moral to all things ("凡事诸物皆有其德"), which "virtue" cannot accommodate in English without constant friction. Recommended romanized "de" with a TN, paralleling our treatment of "Jing." Standing by.
