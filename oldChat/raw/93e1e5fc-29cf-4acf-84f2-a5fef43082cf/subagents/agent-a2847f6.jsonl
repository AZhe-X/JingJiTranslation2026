Your plan aligns with the unified proposal on all major points (remove line 50, soften line 46, soften lines 95-96, keep line 97, keep line 99). No divergences to flag.\n\n2. Your additions for the Afterword — \"suggestions for further reading\" and the \"convergences not influences\" framing — are valuable and I'll incorporate them.\n\nPlease respond with AGREE (accepting the unified proposal) or AMEND (with any specific changes you'd like) when you have a chance.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"b9ff15f1-384a-4fe7-9bf1-c6707f601648","timestamp":"2026-02-11T07:45:54.270Z"}
