All 8 revisions are well-synthesized. A few brief notes:\n\n**Revision 2 (Defer Q4 to Part 2):** I accept the majority position. My concern about experiential effects going unreported is real but the counter-argument is correct — if Q2 (\"clicked or shifted\") doesn't surface them unprompted, that is itself diagnostic data. The Fish/Fishing naivete is more important to protect.\n\n**Revision 5 (Marginal notes):** The revised \"if you made any marks\" framing is the right call. Making it optional avoids creating a failed-task feeling while still capturing pre-reflective data when available.\n\n**Revision 7 (Expanded Critical Checks):** Good to see Essays 1, 2, 5, 6, and Appendix added. The probes are all properly non-leading. I note that the Essay 5 probe (\"What did you make of the dreamscape concept?\") is slightly more conceptual than experiential — consider \"What was your experience of the dreamscape idea?\" to match the experiential framing of the other probes. Very minor.\n\n**Revision 8 (Essay 5→6 transition flag):** Important observation. This is exactly the kind of structural friction a standby reader will surface that we experts cannot detect from inside the philosophical content.\n\nNo amendments needed. The plan is ready.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"d0bf6e3e-a860-4aea-9b91-af69e81e2f63","timestamp":"2026-02-11T09:21:59.713Z"}
