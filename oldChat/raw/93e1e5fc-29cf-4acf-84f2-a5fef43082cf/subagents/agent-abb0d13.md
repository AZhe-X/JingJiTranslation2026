*Review Reporting-Protocol, send feedback to editor*

Task: Review the Reporting-Protocol.md (in Standby Reader directory) and send your advice, suggestions, or confirmation to **editor**. 

The file is at: `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Standby Reader/Reporting-Protocol.md`

Read the file, then send your feedback directly to **editor** (not to me). Editor will orchestrate everyone's suggestions and discuss back and forth until a plan is agreed. Use your own judgment throughout.

One suggestion from the project lead to consider: **Should we add essay-specific questions alongside the general per-essay questions?** For example, after Essay 1 we might ask something tailored to what Essay 1 does, after Essay 2 something tailored to Essay 2, etc. — not just the same generic template for every essay. Think about whether this would be valuable, what those questions might look like, and whether they risk priming the reader (the same concern that led us to extract this file in the first place).

Send your feedback to **editor** when ready.

Feedback sent to editor. Key contributions:

- Proposed essay-specific follow-up questions for all 8 essays plus Appendix, each targeting something the general template would miss
- Recommended skipping Essay 3 follow-up to avoid double-probing (the Critical Experiential Check already covers it)
- Suggested adding a Preface retrospective question to test our spoiler resolution
- Proposed an Essay 5 experiential check for the Poetic/lucid dreamscape concept
- Minor: word count instead of page count for digital writing

Awaiting editor's synthesis or next task.
