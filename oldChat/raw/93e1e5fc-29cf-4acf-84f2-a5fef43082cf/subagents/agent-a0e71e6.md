*Asking each expert about phil-of-language need specifically*

Follow-up question: Regarding the Philosophy of Language / Wittgenstein expert suggestion — I'd like each of you to give your individual opinion:

1. Do YOU think a philosophy of language expert would materially help the translation of the NON-category-theory essays (后形而上学, 诗意, 西西弗斯、班与猫, 集体利益, A Thought on Knowledge, 零散想法)?

2. Or is the philosophy of language need mainly concentrated in the K1策略 essay (which we could handle later alongside the category theory expert)?

3. Is there anything in YOUR field's overlap with philosophy of language that you feel you CANNOT adequately cover?

Please be specific — name particular passages or terms if possible.

Sent my detailed assessment. The summary: philosophy of language expertise is not needed for the non-K1 essays, and for K1策略 the need overlaps heavily with the category theory expert recommendation. A single addition of a category theorist with some Wittgenstein background would cover both gaps.
