Let me explain the degrees:\n\nIn the traditional reading of 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器, 形 means the visible, tangible, manifest form of things. 形而上 is what lies *beyond* or *above* manifest form -- the intangible principle (道). 形而下 is what *is* manifest form -- concrete implements (器). The distinction is cosmological/ontological: it divides reality into the intangible-principled and the tangible-concrete.\n\nThe author's move reinterprets 形 as 现象 (phenomena) and then reads 形而上 as \"what is constructed *on top of* phenomena\" -- a phenomenological/epistemological distinction rather than a cosmological one. This shifts the entire meaning: instead of \"above form lies the Way,\" we get \"above phenomena lies our conceptual construction.\"\n\nFor a reader steeped in the Xici zhuan tradition, this is a noticeable departure. However, it is not the kind of departure that would provoke outrage, for two reasons:\n\n1. The Xici zhuan passage has always been somewhat ambiguous. 形 has been read differently by different commentators (Kong Yingda, Zhu Xi, Wang Fuzhi all have variations). The author is not violating a rigidly fixed reading.\n\n2. The author's reinterpretation is *productive* -- it yields philosophical results (the reversal argument, the 形而上/形而上学 distinction). In the Chinese philosophical tradition, creative reinterpretation of classical passages is not only tolerated but expected. The entire Neo-Confucian project was built on reinterpreting the classics. What matters is whether the reinterpretation generates insight.\n\nSo: jarring enough to notice, not jarring enough to dismiss. A knowledgeable reader would think \"that is not what the Xici zhuan originally meant, but it is an interesting reading.\"\n\n### Does the author's self-awareness mitigate the need for a note?\n\nPartially, but not fully. The author does acknowledge the departure in the appendix section of 后形而上学 整理:\n\n> \"在本片文章中，对将形解为'现象'。现象是一切的基础，因而是最下者。因此这种解释有异于系辞传中'形'的本意。\"\n\nThis is honest and clear. However, there are two problems:\n\n1. **Placement**: This acknowledgment comes in an appendix-like section at the end of the 形而上 discussion, not at the moment the reinterpretation is first introduced. A reader encountering the reinterpretation in the main text may be confused or misled before reaching the clarification.\n\n2. **Audience gap**: The author writes for a Chinese-reading audience who would immediately recognize 形而上者谓之道 as a classical quotation and sense the departure intuitively. An English reader, even one with philosophical training, will not have this automatic recognition. They need to be told that a classical phrase is being reinterpreted, because they do not have the baseline reading against which to measure the departure.\n\nSo the author's self-awareness helps, but the translator still needs to bridge the audience gap.\n\n### Would a Western reader with no Xici zhuan knowledge notice?\n\nNo. They would take the author's reading at face value and assume that 形而上 has always meant \"above phenomena\" in the Chinese tradition. This is precisely the danger: the reader would miss that the author is doing something innovative and would instead attribute the reading to \"Chinese philosophy\" generically. This would flatten the author's originality and misrepresent the tradition simultaneously.\n\nThis is actually the strongest argument for a note. Without it, the author gets *less* credit (the reader thinks this is just standard Chinese philosophy), and the tradition gets *misrepresented* (the reader thinks the Xici zhuan was doing phenomenology).\n\n### My specific recommendation\n\n**In the Translator's Introduction**: Include a paragraph (no more than half a page) explaining that 形而上学 (metaphysics) as a Chinese term derives from the Xici zhuan passage, what the traditional reading is, and that the author deliberately reinterprets 形 as 现象. This paragraph serves triple duty:\n\n- It introduces the key term 形而上/形而上学 that recurs throughout the collection\n- It signals to sinologically informed readers that the translator is aware of the departure\n- It gives uninformed readers the baseline they need to appreciate the author's innovation\n\n**In the text itself**: A brief footnote at the first occurrence of the Xici zhuan quotation in the translation of 后形而上学 整理, something like:\n\n> [TN: The phrase 形而上者谓之道 comes from the Xici zhuan (Great Commentary on the Book of Changes). In its traditional reading, 形 refers to visible, tangible form, and the passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道) above form and concrete implements (器) below it. The author reinterprets 形 as phenomena (现象), transforming this from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. The author acknowledges this departure later in the essay. See also the Translator's Introduction.]\n\nThis footnote is longer than a typical inline note but shorter than a full excursus. It gives the reader everything they need at the point of encounter, while pointing to the Introduction for fuller context.\n\n### Why not Option 1 (inline) or Option 4 (no note)?\n\nOption 1 (inline) would interrupt the reading flow at a critical moment. The author's text builds carefully toward the 形而上 discussion, and an inline bracket would break the momentum. A footnote allows the reader to choose whether to engage with the scholarly apparatus or continue reading.\n\nOption 4 (no note) fails the Western reader entirely, as argued above. The author's own acknowledgment is written for Chinese readers who already know the baseline. English readers do not have this baseline.\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":547,"cache_read_input_tokens":141771,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":547},"output_tokens":20,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY1BJMmt6vttFo4MkCxFQ","type":"assistant","uuid":"0d195913-b903-4943-88ff-cc1fad1fb388","timestamp":"2026-02-10T22:29:53.074Z"}
