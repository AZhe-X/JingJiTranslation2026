I'll respond to the open items briefly since I understand the protocol has now been finalized.\n\n---\n\n**1. Line 31 / Q4 rewording:** Confirmed -- the R2 wording (\"How would you describe what this essay was asking you to do -- follow an argument? Notice something? Something else?\") fully resolves my concern. Clean and non-leading.\n\n---\n\n**2. Essay 5 Critical Check:** The current formulation (\"When the author described the two kinds of dreamscapes, what came to mind?\") is good and satisfies my core concern. \"What came to mind?\" is experiential rather than analytical, and it avoids presupposing the reader noticed a distinction. My only residual thought: the philosophical hinge of Essay 5 is not just the intoxicated/lucid distinction but the argument that total disengagement is impossible (because feeling precedes self). The dreamscape probe tests the former but not the latter. If the final protocol doesn't include a separate probe for this, that is acceptable -- the general per-essay questions should surface it if the argument landed strongly. I note it here for the record so that when we analyze the reader's responses, we are watching for whether the impossibility-of-abandonment argument registered, not just the two-dreamscapes taxonomy.\n\n---\n\n**3. Essay-specific questions / staged model:** I accept the final decision (no essay-specific per-essay questions, all probing in Critical Experiential Checks). The staged model I proposed was the right mechanism in principle, but the team's unanimous decision to keep per-essay questions generic is cleaner in practice. The risk of accumulating priming across essays is real and outweighs the benefit of per-essay specificity.\n\nFor the record, I stand by the Essay 3 reasoning most strongly of all my proposals. The cat must arrive unbidden -- this is the single most important experiential test in the entire collection, and any per-essay probing that points at the three-example structure (even obliquely) risks contaminating it.\n\n---\n\n**4. Essay 5 \"describe the poetic\" uncertainty:** You and the phenomenology-expert are both right that asking the reader to \"describe the poetic in your own words\" activates performance mode. On reflection, the better version would have been \"Could you give an example from your own life of what this essay calls 'the poetic'?\" -- which I proposed in my supplementary feedback. But this is now moot since per-essay specifics were not adopted. The Critical Check for Essay 5 handles it adequately.\n\n---\n\nNo further action needed from me on any of these points. The finalized protocol is sound.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"0082e532-d0b9-4306-b604-179d2d7c0fb0","timestamp":"2026-02-11T09:23:07.724Z"}
