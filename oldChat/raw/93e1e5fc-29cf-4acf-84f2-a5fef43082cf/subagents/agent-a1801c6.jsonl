Reporting Protocol review task:**\n- You assigned me to review the extracted Reporting-Protocol.md and send feedback to editor.\n- You also suggested I consider whether essay-specific questions should be added alongside the generic per-essay template.\n- You reminded me to load all 8+1 source essays and my Analysis Report before sending feedback.\n\n**3. Feedback to editor (two messages):**\n- **Message 1 (before re-reading essays):** 5 recommendations — reduce per-essay template from 5 to 3 questions, remove \"3-5 sentences\" length constraint, soften the math question, add essay-specific follow-ups as second pass, add administration notes.\n- **Message 2 (after re-reading all essays):** Revised essay-specific follow-up questions grounded in actual essay content for Essays 1, 2, 5, 6, and Appendix. No additional questions for Essays 3, 4, 7 (covered by Critical Checks). Proposed Part Transition question after Essay 3. Flagged that Essay 3's Critical Check says \"three examples\" but the essay has four stages.\n\n**4. Editor confirmation request:**\n- Editor asked if I had already sent feedback. I confirmed I had sent two messages.\n\n**5. Identity verification:**\n- You asked me to confirm my identity and summarize my feedback because content headed \"Wittgenstein Expert Feedback\" appeared in chinese-phil-expert's channel.

Final protocol review:**\n- Editor wrote final Reporting-Protocol.md (11/11 approved).\n- I read the final file and noticed Essay 3 probe still says \"three examples.\" Sent a flag to editor about this.\n- Essay 2 probe was resolved via Bob-scenarios approach (epistemology-expert's proposal) with register test handled by Internal Analysis Note #2. I noted this was adequate.\n\n**8. Stand-by and identity checks:**\n- You instructed everyone to stand by.\n- You performed three identity/context checks. I responded to each.\n- Editor sent a stale message (pre-dating the unified plan) acknowledging my initial feedback. I recognized it as stale and took no action.\n\n**9.
