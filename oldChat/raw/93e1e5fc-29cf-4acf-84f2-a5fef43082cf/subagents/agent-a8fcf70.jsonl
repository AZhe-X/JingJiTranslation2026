Make your case, respond to the other positions, and see if you can reach consensus.

One can be absorbed in a task while perfectly aware of one's situation. The author's point is specifically that 沉醉 involves a *failure of meta-awareness* -- you do not know you are in a dreamscape. \"Absorbed\" loses this. Heidegger's Verfallen is relevant but the author is not describing everydayness or fallenness; the author is describing a specific relationship to metaphysical frameworks.\n\n### Response to \"immersed\"\n\n\"Immersed\" has the same problem. We say \"immersed in a novel\" and \"immersed in a game\" -- but the author uses those exact examples for the *清醒* (lucid) dreamscape, not the 沉醉 one.

The author is not *morally* condemning pre-metaphysical existence. However, the author IS making an epistemic evaluation: 沉醉 is a state of unknowing that the post-metaphysical position has moved beyond. Line 29 is explicit: \"因为第〇实在已经被祛魅，我们也无法（再）沉醉其中\" -- \"because Zeroth Reality has been disenchanted, we can no longer be 沉醉 in it.\" The word 祛魅 (disenchantment) reinforces this: 沉醉 is the state *before* disenchantment, i.e., the state of being under an epistemic spell.\n\nThe pejorative edge of \"intoxicated\" matches the author's epistemological evaluation without implying moral condemnation. We do not blame someone for being intoxicated if they did not know the drink was alcoholic -- but we do recognize that their perceptions were altered. This is the author's stance toward traditional metaphysics: not blame, but recognition that an epistemic condition existed and has now been surpassed.\n\n### Practical note\n\nIf the team feels \"intoxicated\" is too strong, \"entranced\" might be a compromise -- it carries the connotation of altered awareness without the substance-abuse associations.
