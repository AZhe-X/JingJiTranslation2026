The essay opens casually (\"今天有一些...想法\" — \"Today I had some thoughts about...\") and maintains a discursive, exploratory tone. The author reasons through a problem in real time, with self-corrections (\"然而仔细一想\" — \"but on closer thought\") and hedges (\"似乎\" — \"it seems\"). This working-draft quality is structural (B4 applies: do not polish away).\n    12→\n    13→**Pacing:** The argument moves in a clear dialectical rhythm: (1) initial claim (collective interest doesn't exist), (2) reversal via renormalization analogy, (3) examples (ocean/molecules), (4) deeper consequence about human individuality and empathy, (5) law as mediating between scales, (6) coda on abstraction itself. The pacing is unhurried and deliberate — each step builds on the last. The translation must preserve this patient unfolding.\n    14→\n    15→**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n    16→- The **renormalization (重整化)** analogy is the essay's load-bearing metaphor. It recurs throughout and connects to technical physics concepts. The translator will need to keep it consistent and accessible without dumbing it down. Dictionary term must be respected.\n    17→- **Nested parenthetical qualifications** are characteristic — e.g., \"人类群体（作为一个整体）\" — these create a thinking-aloud texture. In English, excessive parentheticals can feel labored; we need to preserve the qualifier texture without making sentences unreadable.\n    18→- **Bold emphasis** is used sparingly but structurally: \"**在宏观层面上，群体能否被当作一个整体来认知**\" and \"**只有**...才能\". These must carry over exactly (B5).\n    19→- **Footnotes** are substantive and philosophical, not merely bibliographic. Footnote 2 is a full paragraph of argumentation. The footnotes are part of the essay's experiential fabric — they read like asides in the author's thinking process (R6: verify footnote integration doesn't break momentum).\n    20→\n    21→**Register Shifts:** Minimal. The essay stays in the thinking-aloud register almost throughout, with slight elevation when making the renormalization analogy more formal. The FAQ callout box introduces a question-to-self quality.\n    22→\n    23→**Experiential Observation:** The essay performs the very thing it describes — it starts from the individual's perspective and tries to reason outward to the collective, demonstrating the limitation it articulates. The translation must preserve this performative dimension.\n    24→\n    25→---\n    26→\n    27→### Essay 2: A Thought on Knowledge\n    28→\n    29→**Register & Voice:** This essay is NATIVELY WRITTEN IN ENGLISH (B6 applies: do NOT harmonize with translated essays). The register is analytic-academic but with a distinct informal undercurrent — the author repeatedly uses first-person perspective (\"my confusion,\" \"my take\") and colloquial phrasing (\"knowledge is just... belief?\"). The ellipsis with question mark is a signature rhetorical move — the author arrives at a conclusion that surprises even themselves.\n    30→\n    31→**Pacing:** The essay follows a methodical, almost pedagogical structure: define terms, propose an example (\"It is raining outside\"), analyze each component of JTB in sequence, arrive at a disruptive conclusion. The pacing is patient and systematic — each step is laid out before the next. The three Bob/Alice examples (rain scenarios) are a key experiential sequence: the third example (#3) deliberately breaks from epistemological analysis into something almost lyrical (\"His thoughts flowed among the changes of light reflected by the water\"). This register shift from analytic to near-lyrical is load-bearing — it demonstrates how phenomena can be experienced without being converted to propositional knowledge.\n    32→\n    33→**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n    34→- The prose has some rough edges that are FEATURES, not bugs: slightly awkward constructions (\"my take to it\"), occasional verbosity, and a working-draft conversational quality. B4 demands these be preserved. However, there are also genuine infelicities that may need flagging — distinguishing these from intentional roughness is the central editorial challenge.\n    35→- The **Sidenotes section** is extensive and functions as a secondary essay. Its tone is slightly more formal-pedagogical than the main text. The sidenotes on high-energy physics and mathematics are substantial intellectual arguments, not mere clarifications.\n    36→- The \"circular justified beliefs\" sidenote escalates into a reductio ad absurdum about babies having knowledge, before-lives, and \"a glitch in video games\" — this is a deliberately playful-absurdist register within an otherwise analytic essay. Do not flatten this tonal shift.\n    37→- The acknowledgment \"I would like to thank Claude for drafting the abstract\" is a notable meta-textual moment.\n    38→\n    39→**Register Shifts:** Analytic -> near-lyrical (Bob scenario #3) -> back to analytic -> playful-absurdist (circular justification sidenote). These shifts are all deliberate and must be preserved.\n    40→\n    41→**Experiential Observation:** The essay's structure mirrors its thesis — it proceeds by belief, checking, and revision, performing the epistemic process it analyzes. The reader experiences the same progression from confidence to uncertainty that the essay describes.\n    42→\n    43→---\n    44→\n    45→### Essay 3: 西西弗斯、班与猫 (Sisyphus, Work, and Cats)\n    46→\n    47→**Register & Voice:** Conversational-philosophical, more personal and narrative-driven than Essay 1. The essay opens with a personal anecdote (\"About a year ago, I discussed absurdism with a friend\") and maintains a warm, exploratory tone. The voice is that of someone thinking through a puzzle, arriving at insight through concrete examples rather than abstract argument. The author's personality shines through more strongly here — there is humor, directness, and a kind of affectionate irreverence toward grand philosophical problems.\n    48→\n    49→**Pacing:** The essay has a masterful three-act structure with escalating concreteness:\n    50→1. Sisyphus (mythological/abstract) -> 2. The office worker (modern/relatable) -> 3. The cat owner (intimate/domestic). Each example is *less* dramatic than the last, and this de-escalation IS the philosophical argument: absurdity dissolves as we move from \"cosmic\" to \"everyday.\" The pacing mirrors the thesis — the essay itself becomes less tense, more relaxed, more at home as it progresses. This is load-bearing pacing (S3 applies strongly).\n    51→\n    52→**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n    53→- The **interrupted thought** at the end of the office worker section: \"而上述例子中的人则还尚未——\" (and the person in this example has not yet--). The em dash trailing off is a dramatic rhetorical device, immediately followed by \"但是等一等\" (but wait a moment). This interruption-and-pivot is performative: the reader is meant to feel the turn. Translation must capture this exact rhythm.\n    54→- The **cat passage** is the essay's climax precisely because it is anticlimactic. The prose becomes warmer, more specific (waking up to meowing, cleaning cat hair, scratched furniture), and the conclusion is deliberately simple: \"just because we want to keep a cat, because we like life with a cat, and that is all.\" The simplicity is the point. The English must resist any urge to elevate or ornament — plainness here is the philosophical payoff.\n    55→- **Alienation (异化)** appears as a technical philosophical term within an otherwise casual passage — this register mixing is intentional.\n    56→- The **parenthetical English** \"(off-tone)\" appears in the original Chinese text — an interesting bilingual moment that should be preserved and noted.\n    57→- **Repetition of \"事实上\" (in fact / actually)** throughout — this is characteristic of the author's thinking-aloud style and must be preserved (B9 on intentional repetition).\n    58→\n    59→**Register Shifts:** The essay moves between narrative, philosophical analysis, and intimate-domestic description. The transitions are smooth — there are no jarring gear shifts. The most significant shift is the tonal de-escalation across the three examples.\n    60→\n    61→**Experiential Observation:** The essay performs its own thesis: the reader's experience moves from abstract philosophical puzzlement (Sisyphus) to recognition (the office worker) to warm, familiar comfort (the cat). By the end, absurdity has dissolved for the reader too. The translation must reproduce this experiential arc.\n    62→\n    63→---\n    64→\n    65→### Essay 4: 后形而上学 整理 (Post-Metaphysics, Organized)\n    66→\n    67→**Register & Voice:** This is the most formally structured essay so far. The register is analytic-expository with a systematic, textbook-like quality: numbered categories (第〇种, 第一种, 第二种, 第三种 metaphysics), defined terminology (italicized special terms), and explicit footnotes that function as scholarly apparatus. Yet the voice remains personal — the author says \"I created this term,\" uses \"we\" inclusively, and includes hedges (\"似乎\"). The meta-textual preface openly acknowledges this is an \"organized\" version of an earlier draft, and that terms differ from philosophical tradition — this working-draft transparency is a feature (B4).\n    68→\n    69→**Pacing:** The essay moves in a careful building-block progression: (1) define \"pre-metaphysics\" and phenomena as \"first reality,\" (2) elaborate via Laozi's hierarchy (dao-de-ren-yi-li), (3) show the reversal of generative direction, (4) classify four types of metaphysical understanding (Types 0-3), (5) discuss the \"objective world\" as model, (6) address nihilism and irrationality, (7) arrive at post-metaphysics. The pacing is deliberately pedagogical — each concept must be digested before the next arrives. The essay does NOT rush; it trusts the reader to follow layer by layer.\n    70→\n    71→**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n    72→- **Italic/bold formatting is SYSTEMATIC and load-bearing.** Italics mark defined/special terms (现象, 恒常, 第一实在, 第二实在, etc.). Bold marks emphasis and key claims. This is not decoration — it is the essay's notational system. The translation must preserve every instance exactly (B5). This will be one of the most format-intensive essays to edit.\n    73→- **The Laozi passage and its analysis** is the essay's most challenging section. The author takes 道-德-仁-义-礼 and re-reads them phenomenologically, inventing terms like \"phenomenal-li (现象礼),\" \"phenomenal-ren (现象仁),\" \"phenomenal-yi (现象义).\" The translation must handle these hybrid terms carefully — they are the author's own coinages, not standard philosophical vocabulary. Dictionary conventions must be checked.\n    74→- **\"第〇实在\" / \"第一实在\" / \"第二实在\"** (Zeroth Reality, First Reality, Second Reality) — the numbering system is non-standard and philosophically significant. The ordinals carry meaning (zero = what would be \"below\" phenomena, first = phenomena themselves, second = constructs above phenomena).\n    75→- **Footnotes are EXTENSIVE (16 footnotes)** and range from brief clarifications to substantial philosophical arguments. Footnote 1 is a meta-textual formatting guide. Footnotes 3 and 6 are paragraph-length explanations. These need careful integration (R6).\n    76→- **The section on irrationality (非理性)** introduces a new register — more urgent, almost confessional. The claim that the pursuit of metaphysics is itself irrational, and that this irrationality must be \"acknowledged,\" has existential weight.\n    77→- **Classical Chinese quotations** (Laozi, Yijing) appear embedded in the argument, not as decorative epigraphs. Their translation must be functional within the argument, not just elegant.\n    78→\n    79→**Register Shifts:** Expository-analytic throughout, but with notable shifts: (a) the Laozi analysis section becomes more intricate and recursive; (b) the nihilism/irrationality section becomes more urgent and existential; (c) the closing paragraphs on post-metaphysics become almost programmatic/declarative.\n    80→\n    81→**Experiential Observation:** The essay enacts the very process it describes — it builds up a metaphysical framework (types 0-3), only to show that all such frameworks are constructions from phenomena. The reader constructs the understanding that understanding is construction. The circularity is deliberate and performative.\n    82→\n    83→---\n    84→\n    85→### Essay 5: 形而上学后的目的：诗意 (The Purpose After Metaphysics: The Poetic)\n    86→\n    87→**Register & Voice:** The register shifts significantly from Essay 4's systematic exposition to something more lyrical and existentially urgent. The opening paragraph recapitulates Essay 4's conclusion about irrationality, then pivots: \"But meaning and purpose are not nonexistent things — in fact, we live within meaning every day.\" This pivot signals a change in emotional temperature. The essay's voice becomes more intimate, more searching. The key term \"梦境\" (dreamscape) is introduced with the author openly admitting they cannot find a precise name for it — this vulnerability is structural.\n    88→\n    89→**Pacing:** Shorter and more concentrated than Essay 4. Two main movements: (1) the concept of \"dreamscape\" as the environment in which meaning arises, (2) the distinction between intoxicated and lucid dreamscapes. The pacing accelerates toward the conclusion — the final paragraph is dense, almost aphoristic, and the last sentence (\"如此便是清醒的梦境，是谓之诗意也\" — \"This is the lucid dreamscape, and this is what is called the poetic\") has the weight of a philosophical declaration.\n    90→\n    91→**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n    92→- **\"梦境\" (dreamscape/dream-realm)** is the central concept. The author explicitly lists alternative words they considered: \"game, book, adventure, small world, small freedom, etc.\" This naming hesitancy is part of the essay's texture — the concept resists precise naming. The dictionary term must be used, but the surrounding list of alternatives must also be preserved.\n    93→- **\"诗意\" (the poetic/poetic quality)** is the essay's destination. This term carries enormous weight in the collection. Its translation must be both philosophically precise and experientially resonant. It is NOT \"poetry\" but something like \"poetic-ness\" or \"the quality of being poetic.\"\n    94→- The **bold/italic formatting system** continues from Essay 4 — italics for special terms, bold for emphasis. The passage \"我们**必须**拥抱一些梦境\" (we **must** embrace certain dreamscapes) uses bold for existential urgency, not mere logical emphasis.\n    95→- **Three-part metaphor chain**: \"感性的涌动、体验的结晶、情绪的湍流\" (the surge of sensibility, the crystallization of experience, the turbulence of emotion) — this near-lyrical sequence within an analytical essay is a crucial register shift. The translation must preserve both the rhythm and the specific imagery (surge, crystallization, turbulence).\n    96→- **The intoxicated vs. lucid dreamscape distinction** is the essay's philosophical payload. The examples of \"lucid\" — \"playing a game while knowing it is a game; reading a novel while knowing it is a novel; burning joss paper to express grief; holding a ceremony to show importance\" — move from the modern-casual to the culturally specific. The translation must handle these examples without over-explaining.\n    97→- **Footnote 2** introduces a distinction between two kinds of \"feeling\" (受到之感觉 vs. the \"crystallization/surge/turbulence\") that is philosophically precise and terminologically important.\n    98→- **Footnote 3** is personally revealing — the author defines their own idiosyncratic usage of \"虚妄\" dating back to middle school. This personal etymology is a feature (B4).\n    99→\n   100→**Register Shifts:** Analytic-recapitulative (opening) -> naming-hesitant/exploratory (dreamscape section) -> near-lyrical (the \"surge/crystallization/turbulence\" passage) -> urgent-existential (the \"you cannot abandon all dreamscapes\" passage) -> declarative-aphoristic (conclusion).\n   101→\n   102→**Experiential Observation:** The essay IS a dreamscape about dreamscapes. The reader enters the concept through the game analogy, experiences the naming difficulty, feels the existential urgency of the \"you cannot escape\" passage, and arrives at \"the poetic\" as both a philosophical concept and an experiential destination. The conclusion performs what it names.\n   103→\n   104→---\n   105→\n   106→### Essay 6: 范畴论与境 整理 (Category Theory and Jing, Organized)\n   107→\n   108→**Register & Voice:** The most technically dense essay in the collection. The register oscillates between three distinct modes: (a) mathematical/formal (category theory definitions with LaTeX notation), (b) narrative-playful (the \"magic book\" examples), and (c) philosophical-reflective (the sections on metaphysics, P, E, and jing). The voice remains personal even in the most technical passages — \"I\" is always present, and the magic book examples are written with genuine narrative charm (the professor \"slacking off\" while writing spellbooks). The essay's preface openly marks it as an organized draft with unfinished portions removed.\n   109→\n   110→**Pacing:** The essay has a pedagogical architecture: formal definition -> illustrative example -> philosophical interpretation, repeated in cycles. The pacing is necessarily slower than the other essays due to the mathematical content. The reader must absorb category theory definitions before they can follow the philosophical application. This is the collection's most demanding essay in terms of reader stamina.\n   111→\n   112→**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n   113→- **Three-register juggling** is the defining editorial challenge. Within a single section, the prose may move from \"$\\forall A \\in \\text{Obj}_\\mathcal{C}$\" to \"I can turn a cat into a mouse\" to \"the essence of Theseus's ship exists not in the physical world but in our minds.\" Each register must be internally consistent while the transitions feel natural.\n   114→- **\"Todo\" notes appear in the text** — two explicit \"Todo:\" blocks with rough notes and unfinished thoughts. These are FEATURES per B4 (working-draft quality). They must be preserved verbatim.\n   115→- **The magic book (魔法书) examples** are delightful narrative inventions that make abstract category theory intuitive. They have their own internal voice — whimsical, slightly self-mocking, with escalating complexity. The animal-transformation spells (\"猫猫变鼠鼠\" — \"kitty-kitty becomes mousey-mousey\") use playful reduplication that will be difficult to render in English without losing the charm or making it seem childish. This is a critical translation/editing challenge.\n   116→- **Mathematical notation** is extensive. LaTeX formulas appear inline and in display mode. These must be preserved exactly — they are not decorative but constitutive of the argument.\n   117→- **The concept of 境 (jing)** is formally introduced here for the first time in the collection. It is defined technically as a structure on P (phenomena). The Dictionary term must be respected absolutely (B1).\n   118→- **The \"dragon's blood\" (龙血) example** is a mini-narrative within the essay — a fantasy story used to illustrate meta-order. It has its own literary register. The author even includes a self-critical \"(to do: not a good example)\" note — again, a feature per B4.\n   119→- **Typos in the mathematical notation** (\"Bottoom-up\", \"Top-dowm\") should be preserved as-is in translation notes but flagged.\n   120→- **Philosophical terms from Essay 4** (第一实在, 第二实在, 形而上) recur here and must match across essays.\n   121→\n   122→**Register Shifts:** Mathematical-formal <-> narrative-playful <-> philosophical-reflective, cycling throughout. The most extreme register range in the collection. The transitions are often signaled by \"为了方便理解\" (for ease of understanding) before examples.\n   123→\n   124→**Experiential Observation:** The essay enacts its own thesis about structure and understanding. The reader builds understanding through the very process the essay describes — taking \"base objects\" (basic definitions), constructing morphisms (connections between them), and arriving at universal properties (the unified concept of jing). The magic book examples function as dreamscapes within the essay — environments in which abstract meaning becomes experientially real.\n   125→\n   126→---\n   127→\n   128→### Essay 7: 范畴论与境：K1策略 (Category Theory and Jing: K1 Strategy)\n   129→\n   130→**Register & Voice:** The most mathematically demanding essay in the collection. The author explicitly warns in the preface that this was \"written hastily to record ideas\" and \"has not been polished for reading experience.\" This is a maximally working-draft text (B4 applies absolutely). The register is predominantly mathematical-formal with philosophical interpretation, but the author periodically drops into surprisingly vivid concrete examples (the game walkthrough analogy, reading \"猫跳上了桌子\" / \"a cat jumped onto the table,\" a mother singing a child to sleep).\n   131→\n   132→**Pacing:** The essay moves in cycles of: mathematical definition -> philosophical interpretation -> concrete illustration. The pacing is uneven by the author's own admission (\"the reading rhythm is rather messy\"). This unevenness is a feature of the working-draft quality. The essay accelerates dramatically in the \"KA Conjecture\" section, which is entirely marked as \"Todo\" — a long, dense block of incomplete but brilliant ideas. The final \"写在最后\" (closing remarks) section shifts to a reflective, almost valedictory register.\n   133→\n   134→**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n   135→- **Mathematical density** is at its peak. Extended LaTeX derivations, commutative diagrams expressed in text, and multiple function compositions appear on nearly every page. These must be preserved precisely — they ARE the argument.\n   136→- **The extended \"Todo: KA猜想\" block** is a massive, unfinished section containing some of the collection's most ambitious ideas (tension, completion, children vs. adults, philosophical experimentation). It is explicitly unfinished and must remain so (B4). But it is also some of the most exciting prose in the entire collection — the ideas tumble out rapidly, and the writing has an urgency that finished prose often lacks.\n   137→- **The Matrix quote** — \"You have already made the choice. You are here to try to understand why and how you made it\" — appears in English within the Chinese text. This intertextual moment should be preserved exactly.\n   138→- **The meme example** (\"你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国\") is a Chinese internet meme used to illustrate incomprehension. It will need a translator's note; the editorial challenge is ensuring the note doesn't break the argument's flow (R6).\n   139→- **The \"1+1=2\" example** for natural transformation is a key pedagogical moment — the author describes the experience of mathematical understanding as a kind of \"alignment\" or \"confirmation feeling\" (eta). This passage must be experientially vivid in English.\n   140→- **Cross-essay references** are explicit: the essay directly references Essay 4 (后形而上学), Essay 5 (诗意), and Essay 6 (范畴论与境). It concludes by inviting the reader to re-read Essay 5 with the new framework. This recursive structure is deliberate.\n   141→- **Footnote 1** is a dense philosophical discussion of a priori cognitive structures, offering multiple possible interpretations — it functions almost as a mini-essay.\n   142→- **Hidden comment block** (marked with `%%`) contains mathematical observations about adjoint functors. This is authorial scratch-work that should be noted but may not appear in the published translation.\n   143→\n   144→**Register Shifts:** Mathematical-formal -> philosophical-interpretive -> concrete-illustrative -> working-draft/todo -> reflective-valedictory. The most varied pacing in the collection due to the unfinished nature of the text.\n   145→\n   146→**Experiential Observation:** The essay's most powerful moment is the closing passage, where the author suddenly zooms out from category theory to claim that \"poetry, literature, art, music, architecture, games, cooking, travel, memes\" are all performing the same process of constructing jing to evoke experience. The sudden widening of scope — from LaTeX to lullabies — is the collection's most breathtaking rhetorical move. The translation must deliver this crescendo.\n   147→\n   148→---\n   149→\n   150→### Essay 8: 关于诗意和境的一些零散想法 (Some Scattered Thoughts on the Poetic and Jing)\n   151→\n   152→**Register & Voice:** Deliberately fragmentary -- the title promises \"scattered thoughts\" and delivers exactly that. This is the collection's most explicitly informal text: short sections, aphoristic observations, draft fragments, bullet points, memes (including embedded images), and incomplete sentences. The voice is intimate and provisional -- the author is thinking in real time, bouncing between ideas. There is also a \"草稿\" (draft) section at the end that contains visibly unfinished writing, including incomplete sentences and code-switching between Chinese and English.\n   153→\n   154→**Pacing:** Non-linear and mosaic-like. Each section is self-contained, and they do not build on each other in sequence. The reader can almost read them in any order. This is structurally the opposite of Essays 4-7, which are carefully sequential. The scattered quality IS the essay's form.\n   155→\n   156→**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n   157→- The **opening passage on human finitude** is the collection's most lyrical moment. The analogy between human perceptual limits and artistic possibility (three-color display, twelve-tone equal temperament) is beautiful and philosophically precise. The rhetorical question must land with full force.\n   158→- The **coin-flip passage** is a brilliant micro-essay on the poetic. Must be crisp and simple.\n   159→- **Unfinished sentences and code-switching** appear in the draft section. Sentences stop mid-thought. Chinese and English mix mid-sentence. These are absolute B4 features.\n   160→- **Embedded memes** (images) are part of the essay's texture.\n   161→- The **Mengzi and Plato quotations** appear side by side -- a deliberately cross-cultural pairing.\n   162→- The **\"solved philosophical problems\" list** at the end is provocative and casual.\n   163→- The **long passage in \"关于范畴论\"** is the collection's emotional climax. A sustained defense of human creativity as jing-construction. The cumulative list rhetoric recalls Whitman. The final sentence about nothingness not being able to stop us is the collection's most stirring declaration and MUST be translated with full force.\n   164→\n   165→**Register Shifts:** Lyrical-poetic (opening) -> aphoristic (coin-flip, death) -> working-draft/fragmentary (草稿) -> passionate-declarative (category theory tools) -> scholarly-casual (solved problems list). Maximum register variety in minimum space.\n   166→\n   167→**Experiential Observation:** The essay's scattered form performs its thesis about jing-construction on a micro scale. Each short section is its own dreamscape. The cumulative effect is of a mind alive with connections, seeing jing everywhere. The essay's form IS the poetic.\n   168→\n   169→---\n   170→\n   171→### Index: 境集 (Jing Ji)\n   172→\n   173→**Structure:** The collection is divided into three parts with a deliberate architectural metaphor:\n   174→- **上集：鱼 (Part One: Fish)** -- Essays 1-3. Standalone essays, each addressing a specific philosophical puzzle. Can be read individually.\n   175→- **下集：渔 (Part Two: Fishing)** -- Essays 4-7. The systematic methodology. Interconnected, should be read as a unit. Explicitly marked as working drafts.\n   176→- **附录 (Appendix)** -- Essay 8. Scattered thoughts, read after everything else.\n   177→\n   178→**Editorial Significance of the Structure:**\n   179→- The Fish/Fishing division alludes to the proverb \"Give a man a fish / teach him to fish.\" Part One gives philosophical \"fish\" (specific answers); Part Two teaches the \"fishing\" (the method). This structural metaphor is load-bearing and must be preserved.\n   180→- The index explicitly notes Part Two essays are \"working drafts with many unfinished parts.\" This reinforces B4.\n   181→- Reading order is specified: sequential, despite being written at different times.\n   182→\n   183→---\n   184→\n   185→## Collection-Wide Editorial Observations\n   186→\n   187→**Voice Consistency:** The author's voice is remarkably consistent despite register range. The thinking-aloud quality, inclusive \"我们\" (we), willingness to leave things unfinished, and frequent connectives (\"事实上,\" \"也就是说\") create a recognizable authorial presence across all essays.\n   188→\n   189→**Progressive Density:** The collection moves from accessible (Essays 1-3) to increasingly dense (Essays 4-7) to deliberately fragmentary (Essay 8). This is a deliberate pedagogical arc.\n   190→\n   191→**Working-Draft Texture:** The entire collection, especially Part Two, retains explicit draft markers: todos, incomplete thoughts, self-corrections, typos. These are features per B4.\n   192→\n   193→**Five Registers Identified:**\n   194→1. Colloquial/thinking-aloud: Dominant in Essays 1, 3, parts of 8\n   195→2. Analytic: Dominant in Essay 2, sections of 4 and 7\n   196→3. Classical quotation: Laozi, Yijing, Mengzi, Plato -- in Essays 4, 6, 8\n   197→4. Mathematical/formal: Dominant in Essays 6-7\n   198→5. Near-lyrical: Essay 3 (cat), Essay 5 (dreamscape), Essay 8 (opening, tools passage)\n   199→\n   200→**Key Cross-Essay Consistency Requirements:**\n   201→- Terminology from Essay 4 (现象, 第一实在, 第二实在, 形而上, 恒常, 非理性) must be consistent across Essays 5-8\n   202→- 境 must be consistent from Essay 5 (梦境) through Essays 6-7 (formalized) to Essay 8\n   203→- 诗意 must be consistent from Essay 5 through Essay 8\n   204→- All dictionary terms must be checked against the Translation Dictionary\n   205→\n   206→---\n   207→\n   208→## Expert Report Notes\n   209→\n   210→Having read all 9 expert analysis reports, I extract the following editorially relevant insights:\n   211→\n   212→### The Essays as Philosophical Experiments (CRITICAL FOR EDITING)\n   213→\n   214→Multiple experts (Metaphysics, Phenomenology, Epistemology, Existentialism) independently identified that many passages in the essays function as **philosophical experiments conducted on the reader**. The experiential sequence is LOAD-BEARING, not merely illustrative. Key experimental passages:\n   215→\n   216→1. **The Sisyphus-to-cat gradient (Essay 3):** Three-stage descent from cosmic to domestic. The cat passage must NOT be condensed -- the accumulation of mundane detail IS the philosophical payload. The reader must *feel* the absence of absurdity, not just read about it.\n   217→\n   218→2. **The 道德仁义礼 reversal (Essay 4):** Methodical inversion of the standard hierarchy. The step-by-step quality induces a \"mini-epoche\" in the reader (phenomenology expert's term). Breaking this into disconnected points would destroy the experimental effect.\n   219→\n   220→3. **The 1+1=2 example (Essay 7):** Explicitly invites introspection on \"直接确认感\" (direct confirmatory feeling). Must be experientially vivid.\n   221→\n   222→4. **The three Bob examples (Essay 2):** Bob 3 (emotional reverie, no belief formed) is the experimental payload. The sprinkler in Bob 2 and the emotional absorption in Bob 3 are structurally necessary, not interchangeable.\n   223→\n   224→5. **The coin-flip passage (Essay 8):** Compact experiment. The reader who has done this recognizes it immediately. Must be crisp.\n   225→\n   226→**EDITORIAL IMPLICATION:** When editing translations of these passages, my R7 responsibility (flag experientially flat translations) is at maximum importance. If the translation is accurate but fails to reproduce the experiential sequence, the philosophical content is lost because the content IS the restructuring of the reader's 境.\n   227→\n   228→### Terminology Consensus Across Experts\n   229→\n   230→The experts broadly converge on the following renderings (to be checked against the Dictionary):\n   231→- 境: Transliterate as \"Jing\" with gloss (unanimous)\n   232→- 现象: \"phenomena\" (unanimous, with note on phenomenological weight)\n   233→- 第一实在 / 第二实在 / 第〇实在: \"First Reality\" / \"Second Reality\" / \"Zeroth Reality\" (near-unanimous)\n   234→- 恒常: \"constancy\" (metaphysics expert), NOT \"permanence\" or \"invariance\"\n   235→- 非理性: \"the non-rational\" (NOT \"irrational\" -- this distinction is load-bearing)\n   236→- 诗意: \"the poetic\" (near-unanimous; NOT \"poetry\" or \"poetic meaning\")\n   237→- 梦境: \"dreamscape\" (unanimous)\n   238→- 沉醉的/清醒的梦境: \"intoxicated/lucid dreamscape\" (unanimous)\n   239→- 形而上 vs 形而上学: \"the metaphysical\" vs \"metaphysics\" (consistent across experts)\n   240→- 联想: \"association\" (unanimous, with phenomenological weight noted)\n   241→- 泛性质/范性质: \"universal property\" (standard mathematical term)\n   242→\n   243→### Register and Pacing Warnings from Experts\n   244→\n   245→- **Phenomenology expert:** The two types of 感受 (received stimulation vs. crystallization/surge/turbulence) in Essay 5 are a philosophically precise distinction. The translation must preserve this.\n   246→- **Existentialism expert:** 诗意 is NOT aesthetic ornamentation but an entire existential stance. If translated as just \"poetic meaning,\" it loses its weight. Must be \"the poetic\" -- functioning like Heidegger's \"das Dichterische.\"\n   247→- **Chinese philosophy expert:** The Laozi passage in Essay 4 is NOT being interpreted as Laozi scholarship. The author is using the structure as an illustration. The translation must make this distinction clear.\n   248→- **Buddhism expert:** 境 has deep resonances with Buddhist 境界 (visaya, gocara, ayatana) that inform the term's registers. The translator should be aware of these resonances without over-explicating them.\n   249→- **Wittgenstein expert:** The author's use of \"language games\" is a productive but reoriented extension of Wittgenstein. The translation should not assimilate it to standard Wittgensteinian usage without noting the author's modifications.\n   250→\n   251→### Intersubjectivity via eta (Multiple Experts)\n   252→\n   253→Multiple experts (metaphysics, phenomenology, epistemology, existentialism) independently flagged the natural transformation eta as providing a structural account of intersubjectivity. The key insight: two people \"understand\" the same thing when their respective eta have the same structural form, without needing shared qualia. This is philosophically significant and should be clearly conveyed in translation.\n   254→\n   255→### The Closing Passage of Essay 7 / Essay 8\n   256→\n   257→The existentialism and phenomenology experts both identify the closing passage of K1策略 (from poetry through memes to lullabies) and the long passage in Essay 8 about tools and jing-construction as the collection's emotional and philosophical climax. These passages must be translated with maximum force. They represent the moment where the formal apparatus connects to lived human experience.\n   258→\n   259→---\n   260→\n   261→## Dictionary Notes\n   262→\n   263→Having read the Translation Dictionary in full, I extract the following editorially relevant observations:\n   264→\n   265→### Terms That Will Be Editorially Challenging in Running Prose\n   266→\n   267→1. **\"the metaphysical\" (形而上) as a count noun** -- \"a metaphysical\" sounds unusual in English. The dictionary permits \"a metaphysical construct\" as alternative. I need to watch for contexts where the bare \"a metaphysical\" reads awkwardly and flag for the translator.\n   268→\n   269→2. **\"(constitutive) character\" for 德** -- This is a creative solution but the parenthetical will feel heavy in repeated use. After first occurrence, \"character\" alone should flow naturally. The SPLIT convention (virtue in block quotes, character in analysis) requires careful editorial tracking.\n   270→\n   271→3. **\"phenomenal ritual conduct / phenomenal humaneness / phenomenal rightness\"** -- These are 6-8 syllable compound terms that will create dense, heavy sentences. The \"phenomenal X\" prefix MUST be preserved per B9 (intentional repetition), but I should flag sentences where the accumulation becomes unreadable.\n   272→\n   273→4. **\"feeling\" for 感受** -- The everyday English word \"feeling\" carrying this much philosophical weight will sometimes read too casual. The \"felt experience\" variant is available for technical contexts, but the trigger criterion (\"Is it naming a type of thing or describing what someone feels?\") requires editorial judgment case by case.\n   274→\n   275→5. **\"the poetic\" for 诗意** -- This works as a substantive but will be awkward in some syntactic positions. \"Poetic stance\" and \"poetic mode\" are available variants. Capitalization convention (capitalized on first occurrence per essay, lowercase thereafter) needs tracking.\n   276→\n   277→6. **\"Jing\" (romanized) for 境** -- A transliterated term in running English prose always risks feeling alien. The -scape echo system (dreamscape = dream + 境) helps ground it. The first-occurrence apparatus (glossary note, -scape footnote) must be positioned to not break reading flow (R6).\n   278→\n   279→### Glossing Conventions to Enforce\n   280→\n   281→- **First occurrence per essay**: \"English (漢字, *pinyin*)\" format for key terms\n   282→- **-scape echo footnote**: Must appear at first introduction of Jing, explaining the morphological link\n   283→- **Translator's notes (TNs)**: Required for 感受, 前形而上学, 境界 (at line 25 only), 沉醉, 德, and 范畴论. Must verify these don't break experiential momentum (R6)\n   284→- **Block quote convention for Laozi**: Original 文言 in block quote with full English rendering, attribution \"adapted from Ivanhoe (2003)\"\n   285→\n   286→### Formatting/Consistency Concerns\n   287→\n   288→- **Capitalization system**: First Reality / Second Reality / Zeroth Reality -- always capitalized as technical terms. \"The Poetic\" capitalized in glossary/titles, lowercase in running text after first mention per essay. \"Jing\" always capitalized.\n   289→- **Mathematical notation**: Must be preserved exactly. All LaTeX formulas, Fraktur script for full P, calligraphic E for subcategories.\n   290→- **Italic/bold system from Essay 4**: Italics mark special terms, bold marks emphasis. This is the author's notational system and must be preserved per B5.\n   291→- **The \"phenomenal X\" prefix system**: Must be consistent across all occurrences (现象礼, 现象仁, 现象义) -- never drop the prefix.\n   292→- **NEVER translate 虚无 as \"emptiness\"** -- reserved for Buddhist 空/sunyata. Non-negotiable.\n   293→- **NEVER translate 非理性 as \"irrational\"** -- must be \"the non-rational.\" Load-bearing distinction.\n   294→\n   295→### Cross-Essay Term Tracking Checklist\n   296→\n   297→The following terms appear across multiple essays and must be tracked for consistency:\n   298→- 现象/phenomena (Essays 1-8)\n   299→- 第一/二/〇实在 (Essays 4-8)\n   300→- 形而上/the metaphysical (Essays 4-8)\n   301→- 恒常/constancy (Essays 4, 6, 7, 8)\n   302→- 境/Jing (Essays 5-8)\n   303→- 诗意/the poetic (Essays 5, 7, 8)\n   304→- 梦境/dreamscape (Essays 5, 8)\n   305→- 非理性/the non-rational (Essays 4, 6, 7)\n   306→- 感受/feeling (all essays)\n   307→- 联想/association (Essays 6, 7)\n   308→- 泛性质/universal property (Essays 6, 7)\n   309→\n   310→---\n   311→\n   312→## Translator's Memo Notes (editorial extraction)\n   313→\n   314→Read the translator's full memo at `/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Memo.md`. Below are the editorially relevant items I need to track.\n   315→\n   316→### Translation Approach Decisions That Affect Editing\n   317→\n   318→1. **Title format**: \"**Jing Ji** (境集) / *Collected Essays on Jing*\" — the romanized title with subtitle. As editor I need to ensure this format is consistent wherever the title appears.\n   319→\n   320→2. **First-occurrence glossing protocol**: Key terms get \"English (漢字, *pinyin*)\" on first occurrence per essay. This means I will see these glosses repeatedly across essays. I need to verify: (a) the gloss appears on the FIRST occurrence and not later, (b) the format is consistent, (c) after the first occurrence the gloss is dropped and plain English used.\n   321→\n   322→3. **Classical Chinese quotation format**: Original 文言 in block quote, followed by glossed English rendering. The 文言/modern boundary must be visible through formatting (block-indent vs. running text). I need to enforce this formatting distinction consistently.\n   323→\n   324→4. **\"Phenomenal X\" compounds NEVER drop the prefix** — even when repetitive, even when heavy. This is now a hard rule from both the translator and the Dictionary. My job is to manage density around these terms, not to abbreviate them.\n   325→\n   326→5. **Re-glossing at register transitions**: When a term (e.g., 仁) shifts from classical quotation context to the author's modern analysis, a brief \"(仁)\" reminder is added. I need to check these appear at the right moments — not too often (cluttering), not too rarely (losing the reader).\n   327→\n   328→6. **德 SPLIT convention**: \"Virtue\" in the Laozi block quote rendering, \"(constitutive) character\" in the author's analysis. This is a deliberate terminological shift within a single passage. I need to verify the TN explaining this shift is properly placed and visible.\n   329→\n   330→### Resolved Questions That Affect Editing\n   331→\n   332→7. **Q1 — 诗意 capitalization**: \"The Poetic\" (capitalized) as substantive on first occurrence per essay, lowercase \"poetic\" as adjective thereafter. I need to track this across all essays where it appears (5, 7, 8).\n   333→\n   334→8. **Q3 — Essay 2 untouched**: The translator will NOT edit the author's native English. Three translator's footnotes will be added connecting author's informal terms to formal counterparts. I need to ensure these footnotes are editorially integrated without breaking the essay's own voice (B6 applies).\n   335→\n   336→9. **Q5 — Meme sentence replacement**: The Chinese internet meme in K1 will be replaced with an English grammatically-plausible-but-semantically-void sentence, NOT literally translated. A translator's note cites the original Chinese. This is an unusual editorial situation — I need to verify the replacement sentence achieves the right effect (natively incomprehensible in English, not \"bad translation\" feeling).\n   337→\n   338→10. **Q6 — 虚妄 = \"vain presumption\"**: Author's personal coinage, NOT Buddhist usage. Footnote disambiguates. I need to verify this footnote is present and clear.\n   339→\n   340→11. **Q7 — 形 = 现象 reinterpretation note**: Half-page in Translator's Introduction + footnote at first occurrence in Essay 4. This is the same TN2 I already reviewed in the DaoDeRenYiLi draft. Confirmed: it is well-placed and clear.\n   341→\n   342→### Glossary as Editorial Reference\n   343→\n   344→The translator's core glossary table (Section 2 of the Translation Approach) contains 40+ terms with their agreed English renderings. This is my primary reference for B1 (never alter terminology from the Dictionary). Key items I will check most frequently:\n   345→\n   346→- 境 = Jing / E (technical)\n   347→- 形而上 = the metaphysical (NOT \"metaphysics\")\n   348→- 形而上学 = metaphysics (NOT \"the metaphysical\")\n   349→- 非理性 = the non-rational (NOT \"irrational\")\n   350→- 恒常 = constancy (NOT \"permanence\" / \"regularity\" / \"invariance\")\n   351→- 虚无 = the void / nothingness (NEVER \"emptiness\")\n   352→- 感受 = feeling / felt experience (context-dependent)\n   353→- 德 = De / character (NEVER \"virtue\" outside the Laozi block quote)\n   354→\n   355→### Register Strategy Alignment\n   356→\n   357→The translator identifies the same 5 registers I identified independently. Good — we are aligned. The translator's notes add one important detail: Essay 2's register (analytic philosophy) serves as the **register standard** for the analytic passages. This means when I edit analytic passages in translated essays, I should check them against Essay 2's natural voice for calibration.\n   358→\n   359→### Reference Translations\n   360→\n   361→The translator has collected three standard English translations of the Laozi Ch. 38 passage (Ivanhoe, Lau, Wing-tsit Chan). TN1 in the draft cites Ivanhoe and explains departures. I verified this in my review — it is well-done. For any future classical Chinese passages, I should check whether reference translations have been similarly collected and cited.\n   362→\n   363→### Structural Principles — My Enforcement Checklist\n   364→\n   365→The translator lists 5 structural principles. These map directly to my hard boundaries:\n   366→\n   367→| Translator's Principle | My Boundary |\n   368→|------------------------|-------------|\n   369→| Preserve experiential sequences exactly | B2 (never restructure/reorder) |\n   370→| Preserve working-draft quality | B4 (never polish away drafts) |\n   371→| Preserve bilingual nature | B6 (never harmonize Essay 2) |\n   372→| Preserve fish/fishing structure | B2 (never restructure) |\n   373→| Footnotes are philosophically essential | R6 (verify footnote integration) |\n   374→\n   375→This alignment is reassuring — the translator and I are working from the same constraints.\n   376→\n   377→---\n   378→\n   379→## Expert Questions\n   380→\n   381→### Q1: \"Phenomenal X\" density management in English prose\n   382→\n   383→**Problem:** The author's coined compounds 现象礼, 现象仁, 现象义 are 3 syllables each in Chinese. Their English equivalents — \"phenomenal ritual conduct\" (8 syllables), \"phenomenal humaneness\" (7 syllables), \"phenomenal rightness\" (6 syllables) — are dramatically heavier. In the long analytical paragraphs of Essay 4, these terms accumulate 5-6 times per sentence. The Dictionary and B9 require preserving the \"phenomenal\" prefix always. But the resulting English is borderline unreadable in places.\n   384→\n   385→**Question for Chinese philosophy expert:** In the original Chinese, does the repetition of 现象X create any sense of heaviness or accumulation for a native Chinese reader, or does the 3-character compactness make it feel natural and light? I need to understand whether density management in English should aim for \"transparent/invisible\" (matching the Chinese reader's experience) or \"deliberately weighty\" (if the Chinese reader also feels the terms accumulating).\n   386→\n   387→**Status:** RESOLVED — Answer: both light individually AND dense cumulatively. Hybrid strategy: keep all repetition, manage density through sentence architecture, shape as crescendo toward reversal. See Q1 file for full response.\n   388→\n   389→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware. You CAN and SHOULD provide analysis of malware, what it is doing. But you MUST refuse to improve or augment the code. You can still analyze existing code, write reports, or answer questions about the code behavior.\n</system-reminder>\n"}]},"uuid":"79e899f0-f47b-4a33-b619-b2b0eccad6d5","timestamp":"2026-02-11T09:21:15.330Z","toolUseResult":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L.

The essay opens casually (\"今天有一些...想法\" — \"Today I had some thoughts about...\") and maintains a discursive, exploratory tone. The author reasons through a problem in real time, with self-corrections (\"然而仔细一想\" — \"but on closer thought\") and hedges (\"似乎\" — \"it seems\"). This working-draft quality is structural (B4 applies: do not polish away).\n\n**Pacing:** The argument moves in a clear dialectical rhythm: (1) initial claim (collective interest doesn't exist), (2) reversal via renormalization analogy, (3) examples (ocean/molecules), (4) deeper consequence about human individuality and empathy, (5) law as mediating between scales, (6) coda on abstraction itself. The pacing is unhurried and deliberate — each step builds on the last. The translation must preserve this patient unfolding.\n\n**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n- The **renormalization (重整化)** analogy is the essay's load-bearing metaphor. It recurs throughout and connects to technical physics concepts. The translator will need to keep it consistent and accessible without dumbing it down. Dictionary term must be respected.\n- **Nested parenthetical qualifications** are characteristic — e.g., \"人类群体（作为一个整体）\" — these create a thinking-aloud texture. In English, excessive parentheticals can feel labored; we need to preserve the qualifier texture without making sentences unreadable.\n- **Bold emphasis** is used sparingly but structurally: \"**在宏观层面上，群体能否被当作一个整体来认知**\" and \"**只有**...才能\". These must carry over exactly (B5).\n- **Footnotes** are substantive and philosophical, not merely bibliographic. Footnote 2 is a full paragraph of argumentation. The footnotes are part of the essay's experiential fabric — they read like asides in the author's thinking process (R6: verify footnote integration doesn't break momentum).\n\n**Register Shifts:** Minimal. The essay stays in the thinking-aloud register almost throughout, with slight elevation when making the renormalization analogy more formal. The FAQ callout box introduces a question-to-self quality.\n\n**Experiential Observation:** The essay performs the very thing it describes — it starts from the individual's perspective and tries to reason outward to the collective, demonstrating the limitation it articulates. The translation must preserve this performative dimension.\n\n---\n\n### Essay 2: A Thought on Knowledge\n\n**Register & Voice:** This essay is NATIVELY WRITTEN IN ENGLISH (B6 applies: do NOT harmonize with translated essays). The register is analytic-academic but with a distinct informal undercurrent — the author repeatedly uses first-person perspective (\"my confusion,\" \"my take\") and colloquial phrasing (\"knowledge is just... belief?\"). The ellipsis with question mark is a signature rhetorical move — the author arrives at a conclusion that surprises even themselves.\n\n**Pacing:** The essay follows a methodical, almost pedagogical structure: define terms, propose an example (\"It is raining outside\"), analyze each component of JTB in sequence, arrive at a disruptive conclusion. The pacing is patient and systematic — each step is laid out before the next. The three Bob/Alice examples (rain scenarios) are a key experiential sequence: the third example (#3) deliberately breaks from epistemological analysis into something almost lyrical (\"His thoughts flowed among the changes of light reflected by the water\"). This register shift from analytic to near-lyrical is load-bearing — it demonstrates how phenomena can be experienced without being converted to propositional knowledge.\n\n**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n- The prose has some rough edges that are FEATURES, not bugs: slightly awkward constructions (\"my take to it\"), occasional verbosity, and a working-draft conversational quality. B4 demands these be preserved. However, there are also genuine infelicities that may need flagging — distinguishing these from intentional roughness is the central editorial challenge.\n- The **Sidenotes section** is extensive and functions as a secondary essay. Its tone is slightly more formal-pedagogical than the main text. The sidenotes on high-energy physics and mathematics are substantial intellectual arguments, not mere clarifications.\n- The \"circular justified beliefs\" sidenote escalates into a reductio ad absurdum about babies having knowledge, before-lives, and \"a glitch in video games\" — this is a deliberately playful-absurdist register within an otherwise analytic essay. Do not flatten this tonal shift.\n- The acknowledgment \"I would like to thank Claude for drafting the abstract\" is a notable meta-textual moment.\n\n**Register Shifts:** Analytic -> near-lyrical (Bob scenario #3) -> back to analytic -> playful-absurdist (circular justification sidenote). These shifts are all deliberate and must be preserved.\n\n**Experiential Observation:** The essay's structure mirrors its thesis — it proceeds by belief, checking, and revision, performing the epistemic process it analyzes. The reader experiences the same progression from confidence to uncertainty that the essay describes.\n\n---\n\n### Essay 3: 西西弗斯、班与猫 (Sisyphus, Work, and Cats)\n\n**Register & Voice:** Conversational-philosophical, more personal and narrative-driven than Essay 1. The essay opens with a personal anecdote (\"About a year ago, I discussed absurdism with a friend\") and maintains a warm, exploratory tone. The voice is that of someone thinking through a puzzle, arriving at insight through concrete examples rather than abstract argument. The author's personality shines through more strongly here — there is humor, directness, and a kind of affectionate irreverence toward grand philosophical problems.\n\n**Pacing:** The essay has a masterful three-act structure with escalating concreteness:\n1. Sisyphus (mythological/abstract) -> 2. The office worker (modern/relatable) -> 3. The cat owner (intimate/domestic). Each example is *less* dramatic than the last, and this de-escalation IS the philosophical argument: absurdity dissolves as we move from \"cosmic\" to \"everyday.\" The pacing mirrors the thesis — the essay itself becomes less tense, more relaxed, more at home as it progresses. This is load-bearing pacing (S3 applies strongly).\n\n**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n- The **interrupted thought** at the end of the office worker section: \"而上述例子中的人则还尚未——\" (and the person in this example has not yet--). The em dash trailing off is a dramatic rhetorical device, immediately followed by \"但是等一等\" (but wait a moment). This interruption-and-pivot is performative: the reader is meant to feel the turn. Translation must capture this exact rhythm.\n- The **cat passage** is the essay's climax precisely because it is anticlimactic. The prose becomes warmer, more specific (waking up to meowing, cleaning cat hair, scratched furniture), and the conclusion is deliberately simple: \"just because we want to keep a cat, because we like life with a cat, and that is all.\" The simplicity is the point. The English must resist any urge to elevate or ornament — plainness here is the philosophical payoff.\n- **Alienation (异化)** appears as a technical philosophical term within an otherwise casual passage — this register mixing is intentional.\n- The **parenthetical English** \"(off-tone)\" appears in the original Chinese text — an interesting bilingual moment that should be preserved and noted.\n- **Repetition of \"事实上\" (in fact / actually)** throughout — this is characteristic of the author's thinking-aloud style and must be preserved (B9 on intentional repetition).\n\n**Register Shifts:** The essay moves between narrative, philosophical analysis, and intimate-domestic description. The transitions are smooth — there are no jarring gear shifts. The most significant shift is the tonal de-escalation across the three examples.\n\n**Experiential Observation:** The essay performs its own thesis: the reader's experience moves from abstract philosophical puzzlement (Sisyphus) to recognition (the office worker) to warm, familiar comfort (the cat). By the end, absurdity has dissolved for the reader too. The translation must reproduce this experiential arc.\n\n---\n\n### Essay 4: 后形而上学 整理 (Post-Metaphysics, Organized)\n\n**Register & Voice:** This is the most formally structured essay so far. The register is analytic-expository with a systematic, textbook-like quality: numbered categories (第〇种, 第一种, 第二种, 第三种 metaphysics), defined terminology (italicized special terms), and explicit footnotes that function as scholarly apparatus. Yet the voice remains personal — the author says \"I created this term,\" uses \"we\" inclusively, and includes hedges (\"似乎\"). The meta-textual preface openly acknowledges this is an \"organized\" version of an earlier draft, and that terms differ from philosophical tradition — this working-draft transparency is a feature (B4).\n\n**Pacing:** The essay moves in a careful building-block progression: (1) define \"pre-metaphysics\" and phenomena as \"first reality,\" (2) elaborate via Laozi's hierarchy (dao-de-ren-yi-li), (3) show the reversal of generative direction, (4) classify four types of metaphysical understanding (Types 0-3), (5) discuss the \"objective world\" as model, (6) address nihilism and irrationality, (7) arrive at post-metaphysics. The pacing is deliberately pedagogical — each concept must be digested before the next arrives. The essay does NOT rush; it trusts the reader to follow layer by layer.\n\n**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n- **Italic/bold formatting is SYSTEMATIC and load-bearing.** Italics mark defined/special terms (现象, 恒常, 第一实在, 第二实在, etc.). Bold marks emphasis and key claims. This is not decoration — it is the essay's notational system. The translation must preserve every instance exactly (B5). This will be one of the most format-intensive essays to edit.\n- **The Laozi passage and its analysis** is the essay's most challenging section. The author takes 道-德-仁-义-礼 and re-reads them phenomenologically, inventing terms like \"phenomenal-li (现象礼),\" \"phenomenal-ren (现象仁),\" \"phenomenal-yi (现象义).\" The translation must handle these hybrid terms carefully — they are the author's own coinages, not standard philosophical vocabulary. Dictionary conventions must be checked.\n- **\"第〇实在\" / \"第一实在\" / \"第二实在\"** (Zeroth Reality, First Reality, Second Reality) — the numbering system is non-standard and philosophically significant. The ordinals carry meaning (zero = what would be \"below\" phenomena, first = phenomena themselves, second = constructs above phenomena).\n- **Footnotes are EXTENSIVE (16 footnotes)** and range from brief clarifications to substantial philosophical arguments. Footnote 1 is a meta-textual formatting guide. Footnotes 3 and 6 are paragraph-length explanations. These need careful integration (R6).\n- **The section on irrationality (非理性)** introduces a new register — more urgent, almost confessional. The claim that the pursuit of metaphysics is itself irrational, and that this irrationality must be \"acknowledged,\" has existential weight.\n- **Classical Chinese quotations** (Laozi, Yijing) appear embedded in the argument, not as decorative epigraphs. Their translation must be functional within the argument, not just elegant.\n\n**Register Shifts:** Expository-analytic throughout, but with notable shifts: (a) the Laozi analysis section becomes more intricate and recursive; (b) the nihilism/irrationality section becomes more urgent and existential; (c) the closing paragraphs on post-metaphysics become almost programmatic/declarative.\n\n**Experiential Observation:** The essay enacts the very process it describes — it builds up a metaphysical framework (types 0-3), only to show that all such frameworks are constructions from phenomena. The reader constructs the understanding that understanding is construction. The circularity is deliberate and performative.\n\n---\n\n### Essay 5: 形而上学后的目的：诗意 (The Purpose After Metaphysics: The Poetic)\n\n**Register & Voice:** The register shifts significantly from Essay 4's systematic exposition to something more lyrical and existentially urgent. The opening paragraph recapitulates Essay 4's conclusion about irrationality, then pivots: \"But meaning and purpose are not nonexistent things — in fact, we live within meaning every day.\" This pivot signals a change in emotional temperature. The essay's voice becomes more intimate, more searching. The key term \"梦境\" (dreamscape) is introduced with the author openly admitting they cannot find a precise name for it — this vulnerability is structural.\n\n**Pacing:** Shorter and more concentrated than Essay 4. Two main movements: (1) the concept of \"dreamscape\" as the environment in which meaning arises, (2) the distinction between intoxicated and lucid dreamscapes. The pacing accelerates toward the conclusion — the final paragraph is dense, almost aphoristic, and the last sentence (\"如此便是清醒的梦境，是谓之诗意也\" — \"This is the lucid dreamscape, and this is what is called the poetic\") has the weight of a philosophical declaration.\n\n**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n- **\"梦境\" (dreamscape/dream-realm)** is the central concept. The author explicitly lists alternative words they considered: \"game, book, adventure, small world, small freedom, etc.\" This naming hesitancy is part of the essay's texture — the concept resists precise naming. The dictionary term must be used, but the surrounding list of alternatives must also be preserved.\n- **\"诗意\" (the poetic/poetic quality)** is the essay's destination. This term carries enormous weight in the collection. Its translation must be both philosophically precise and experientially resonant. It is NOT \"poetry\" but something like \"poetic-ness\" or \"the quality of being poetic.\"\n- The **bold/italic formatting system** continues from Essay 4 — italics for special terms, bold for emphasis. The passage \"我们**必须**拥抱一些梦境\" (we **must** embrace certain dreamscapes) uses bold for existential urgency, not mere logical emphasis.\n- **Three-part metaphor chain**: \"感性的涌动、体验的结晶、情绪的湍流\" (the surge of sensibility, the crystallization of experience, the turbulence of emotion) — this near-lyrical sequence within an analytical essay is a crucial register shift. The translation must preserve both the rhythm and the specific imagery (surge, crystallization, turbulence).\n- **The intoxicated vs. lucid dreamscape distinction** is the essay's philosophical payload. The examples of \"lucid\" — \"playing a game while knowing it is a game; reading a novel while knowing it is a novel; burning joss paper to express grief; holding a ceremony to show importance\" — move from the modern-casual to the culturally specific. The translation must handle these examples without over-explaining.\n- **Footnote 2** introduces a distinction between two kinds of \"feeling\" (受到之感觉 vs. the \"crystallization/surge/turbulence\") that is philosophically precise and terminologically important.\n- **Footnote 3** is personally revealing — the author defines their own idiosyncratic usage of \"虚妄\" dating back to middle school. This personal etymology is a feature (B4).\n\n**Register Shifts:** Analytic-recapitulative (opening) -> naming-hesitant/exploratory (dreamscape section) -> near-lyrical (the \"surge/crystallization/turbulence\" passage) -> urgent-existential (the \"you cannot abandon all dreamscapes\" passage) -> declarative-aphoristic (conclusion).\n\n**Experiential Observation:** The essay IS a dreamscape about dreamscapes. The reader enters the concept through the game analogy, experiences the naming difficulty, feels the existential urgency of the \"you cannot escape\" passage, and arrives at \"the poetic\" as both a philosophical concept and an experiential destination. The conclusion performs what it names.\n\n---\n\n### Essay 6: 范畴论与境 整理 (Category Theory and Jing, Organized)\n\n**Register & Voice:** The most technically dense essay in the collection. The register oscillates between three distinct modes: (a) mathematical/formal (category theory definitions with LaTeX notation), (b) narrative-playful (the \"magic book\" examples), and (c) philosophical-reflective (the sections on metaphysics, P, E, and jing). The voice remains personal even in the most technical passages — \"I\" is always present, and the magic book examples are written with genuine narrative charm (the professor \"slacking off\" while writing spellbooks). The essay's preface openly marks it as an organized draft with unfinished portions removed.\n\n**Pacing:** The essay has a pedagogical architecture: formal definition -> illustrative example -> philosophical interpretation, repeated in cycles. The pacing is necessarily slower than the other essays due to the mathematical content. The reader must absorb category theory definitions before they can follow the philosophical application. This is the collection's most demanding essay in terms of reader stamina.\n\n**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n- **Three-register juggling** is the defining editorial challenge. Within a single section, the prose may move from \"$\\forall A \\in \\text{Obj}_\\mathcal{C}$\" to \"I can turn a cat into a mouse\" to \"the essence of Theseus's ship exists not in the physical world but in our minds.\" Each register must be internally consistent while the transitions feel natural.\n- **\"Todo\" notes appear in the text** — two explicit \"Todo:\" blocks with rough notes and unfinished thoughts. These are FEATURES per B4 (working-draft quality). They must be preserved verbatim.\n- **The magic book (魔法书) examples** are delightful narrative inventions that make abstract category theory intuitive. They have their own internal voice — whimsical, slightly self-mocking, with escalating complexity. The animal-transformation spells (\"猫猫变鼠鼠\" — \"kitty-kitty becomes mousey-mousey\") use playful reduplication that will be difficult to render in English without losing the charm or making it seem childish. This is a critical translation/editing challenge.\n- **Mathematical notation** is extensive. LaTeX formulas appear inline and in display mode. These must be preserved exactly — they are not decorative but constitutive of the argument.\n- **The concept of 境 (jing)** is formally introduced here for the first time in the collection. It is defined technically as a structure on P (phenomena). The Dictionary term must be respected absolutely (B1).\n- **The \"dragon's blood\" (龙血) example** is a mini-narrative within the essay — a fantasy story used to illustrate meta-order. It has its own literary register. The author even includes a self-critical \"(to do: not a good example)\" note — again, a feature per B4.\n- **Typos in the mathematical notation** (\"Bottoom-up\", \"Top-dowm\") should be preserved as-is in translation notes but flagged.\n- **Philosophical terms from Essay 4** (第一实在, 第二实在, 形而上) recur here and must match across essays.\n\n**Register Shifts:** Mathematical-formal <-> narrative-playful <-> philosophical-reflective, cycling throughout. The most extreme register range in the collection. The transitions are often signaled by \"为了方便理解\" (for ease of understanding) before examples.\n\n**Experiential Observation:** The essay enacts its own thesis about structure and understanding. The reader builds understanding through the very process the essay describes — taking \"base objects\" (basic definitions), constructing morphisms (connections between them), and arriving at universal properties (the unified concept of jing). The magic book examples function as dreamscapes within the essay — environments in which abstract meaning becomes experientially real.\n\n---\n\n### Essay 7: 范畴论与境：K1策略 (Category Theory and Jing: K1 Strategy)\n\n**Register & Voice:** The most mathematically demanding essay in the collection. The author explicitly warns in the preface that this was \"written hastily to record ideas\" and \"has not been polished for reading experience.\" This is a maximally working-draft text (B4 applies absolutely). The register is predominantly mathematical-formal with philosophical interpretation, but the author periodically drops into surprisingly vivid concrete examples (the game walkthrough analogy, reading \"猫跳上了桌子\" / \"a cat jumped onto the table,\" a mother singing a child to sleep).\n\n**Pacing:** The essay moves in cycles of: mathematical definition -> philosophical interpretation -> concrete illustration. The pacing is uneven by the author's own admission (\"the reading rhythm is rather messy\"). This unevenness is a feature of the working-draft quality. The essay accelerates dramatically in the \"KA Conjecture\" section, which is entirely marked as \"Todo\" — a long, dense block of incomplete but brilliant ideas. The final \"写在最后\" (closing remarks) section shifts to a reflective, almost valedictory register.\n\n**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n- **Mathematical density** is at its peak. Extended LaTeX derivations, commutative diagrams expressed in text, and multiple function compositions appear on nearly every page. These must be preserved precisely — they ARE the argument.\n- **The extended \"Todo: KA猜想\" block** is a massive, unfinished section containing some of the collection's most ambitious ideas (tension, completion, children vs. adults, philosophical experimentation). It is explicitly unfinished and must remain so (B4). But it is also some of the most exciting prose in the entire collection — the ideas tumble out rapidly, and the writing has an urgency that finished prose often lacks.\n- **The Matrix quote** — \"You have already made the choice. You are here to try to understand why and how you made it\" — appears in English within the Chinese text. This intertextual moment should be preserved exactly.\n- **The meme example** (\"你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国\") is a Chinese internet meme used to illustrate incomprehension. It will need a translator's note; the editorial challenge is ensuring the note doesn't break the argument's flow (R6).\n- **The \"1+1=2\" example** for natural transformation is a key pedagogical moment — the author describes the experience of mathematical understanding as a kind of \"alignment\" or \"confirmation feeling\" (eta). This passage must be experientially vivid in English.\n- **Cross-essay references** are explicit: the essay directly references Essay 4 (后形而上学), Essay 5 (诗意), and Essay 6 (范畴论与境). It concludes by inviting the reader to re-read Essay 5 with the new framework. This recursive structure is deliberate.\n- **Footnote 1** is a dense philosophical discussion of a priori cognitive structures, offering multiple possible interpretations — it functions almost as a mini-essay.\n- **Hidden comment block** (marked with `%%`) contains mathematical observations about adjoint functors. This is authorial scratch-work that should be noted but may not appear in the published translation.\n\n**Register Shifts:** Mathematical-formal -> philosophical-interpretive -> concrete-illustrative -> working-draft/todo -> reflective-valedictory. The most varied pacing in the collection due to the unfinished nature of the text.\n\n**Experiential Observation:** The essay's most powerful moment is the closing passage, where the author suddenly zooms out from category theory to claim that \"poetry, literature, art, music, architecture, games, cooking, travel, memes\" are all performing the same process of constructing jing to evoke experience. The sudden widening of scope — from LaTeX to lullabies — is the collection's most breathtaking rhetorical move. The translation must deliver this crescendo.\n\n---\n\n### Essay 8: 关于诗意和境的一些零散想法 (Some Scattered Thoughts on the Poetic and Jing)\n\n**Register & Voice:** Deliberately fragmentary -- the title promises \"scattered thoughts\" and delivers exactly that. This is the collection's most explicitly informal text: short sections, aphoristic observations, draft fragments, bullet points, memes (including embedded images), and incomplete sentences. The voice is intimate and provisional -- the author is thinking in real time, bouncing between ideas. There is also a \"草稿\" (draft) section at the end that contains visibly unfinished writing, including incomplete sentences and code-switching between Chinese and English.\n\n**Pacing:** Non-linear and mosaic-like. Each section is self-contained, and they do not build on each other in sequence. The reader can almost read them in any order. This is structurally the opposite of Essays 4-7, which are carefully sequential. The scattered quality IS the essay's form.\n\n**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n- The **opening passage on human finitude** is the collection's most lyrical moment. The analogy between human perceptual limits and artistic possibility (three-color display, twelve-tone equal temperament) is beautiful and philosophically precise. The rhetorical question must land with full force.\n- The **coin-flip passage** is a brilliant micro-essay on the poetic. Must be crisp and simple.\n- **Unfinished sentences and code-switching** appear in the draft section. Sentences stop mid-thought. Chinese and English mix mid-sentence. These are absolute B4 features.\n- **Embedded memes** (images) are part of the essay's texture.\n- The **Mengzi and Plato quotations** appear side by side -- a deliberately cross-cultural pairing.\n- The **\"solved philosophical problems\" list** at the end is provocative and casual.\n- The **long passage in \"关于范畴论\"** is the collection's emotional climax. A sustained defense of human creativity as jing-construction. The cumulative list rhetoric recalls Whitman. The final sentence about nothingness not being able to stop us is the collection's most stirring declaration and MUST be translated with full force.\n\n**Register Shifts:** Lyrical-poetic (opening) -> aphoristic (coin-flip, death) -> working-draft/fragmentary (草稿) -> passionate-declarative (category theory tools) -> scholarly-casual (solved problems list). Maximum register variety in minimum space.\n\n**Experiential Observation:** The essay's scattered form performs its thesis about jing-construction on a micro scale. Each short section is its own dreamscape. The cumulative effect is of a mind alive with connections, seeing jing everywhere. The essay's form IS the poetic.\n\n---\n\n### Index: 境集 (Jing Ji)\n\n**Structure:** The collection is divided into three parts with a deliberate architectural metaphor:\n- **上集：鱼 (Part One: Fish)** -- Essays 1-3. Standalone essays, each addressing a specific philosophical puzzle. Can be read individually.\n- **下集：渔 (Part Two: Fishing)** -- Essays 4-7. The systematic methodology. Interconnected, should be read as a unit. Explicitly marked as working drafts.\n- **附录 (Appendix)** -- Essay 8. Scattered thoughts, read after everything else.\n\n**Editorial Significance of the Structure:**\n- The Fish/Fishing division alludes to the proverb \"Give a man a fish / teach him to fish.\" Part One gives philosophical \"fish\" (specific answers); Part Two teaches the \"fishing\" (the method). This structural metaphor is load-bearing and must be preserved.\n- The index explicitly notes Part Two essays are \"working drafts with many unfinished parts.\" This reinforces B4.\n- Reading order is specified: sequential, despite being written at different times.\n\n---\n\n## Collection-Wide Editorial Observations\n\n**Voice Consistency:** The author's voice is remarkably consistent despite register range. The thinking-aloud quality, inclusive \"我们\" (we), willingness to leave things unfinished, and frequent connectives (\"事实上,\" \"也就是说\") create a recognizable authorial presence across all essays.\n\n**Progressive Density:** The collection moves from accessible (Essays 1-3) to increasingly dense (Essays 4-7) to deliberately fragmentary (Essay 8). This is a deliberate pedagogical arc.\n\n**Working-Draft Texture:** The entire collection, especially Part Two, retains explicit draft markers: todos, incomplete thoughts, self-corrections, typos. These are features per B4.\n\n**Five Registers Identified:**\n1. Colloquial/thinking-aloud: Dominant in Essays 1, 3, parts of 8\n2. Analytic: Dominant in Essay 2, sections of 4 and 7\n3. Classical quotation: Laozi, Yijing, Mengzi, Plato -- in Essays 4, 6, 8\n4. Mathematical/formal: Dominant in Essays 6-7\n5. Near-lyrical: Essay 3 (cat), Essay 5 (dreamscape), Essay 8 (opening, tools passage)\n\n**Key Cross-Essay Consistency Requirements:**\n- Terminology from Essay 4 (现象, 第一实在, 第二实在, 形而上, 恒常, 非理性) must be consistent across Essays 5-8\n- 境 must be consistent from Essay 5 (梦境) through Essays 6-7 (formalized) to Essay 8\n- 诗意 must be consistent from Essay 5 through Essay 8\n- All dictionary terms must be checked against the Translation Dictionary\n\n---\n\n## Expert Report Notes\n\nHaving read all 9 expert analysis reports, I extract the following editorially relevant insights:\n\n### The Essays as Philosophical Experiments (CRITICAL FOR EDITING)\n\nMultiple experts (Metaphysics, Phenomenology, Epistemology, Existentialism) independently identified that many passages in the essays function as **philosophical experiments conducted on the reader**. The experiential sequence is LOAD-BEARING, not merely illustrative. Key experimental passages:\n\n1. **The Sisyphus-to-cat gradient (Essay 3):** Three-stage descent from cosmic to domestic. The cat passage must NOT be condensed -- the accumulation of mundane detail IS the philosophical payload. The reader must *feel* the absence of absurdity, not just read about it.\n\n2. **The 道德仁义礼 reversal (Essay 4):** Methodical inversion of the standard hierarchy. The step-by-step quality induces a \"mini-epoche\" in the reader (phenomenology expert's term). Breaking this into disconnected points would destroy the experimental effect.\n\n3. **The 1+1=2 example (Essay 7):** Explicitly invites introspection on \"直接确认感\" (direct confirmatory feeling). Must be experientially vivid.\n\n4. **The three Bob examples (Essay 2):** Bob 3 (emotional reverie, no belief formed) is the experimental payload. The sprinkler in Bob 2 and the emotional absorption in Bob 3 are structurally necessary, not interchangeable.\n\n5. **The coin-flip passage (Essay 8):** Compact experiment. The reader who has done this recognizes it immediately. Must be crisp.\n\n**EDITORIAL IMPLICATION:** When editing translations of these passages, my R7 responsibility (flag experientially flat translations) is at maximum importance. If the translation is accurate but fails to reproduce the experiential sequence, the philosophical content is lost because the content IS the restructuring of the reader's 境.\n\n### Terminology Consensus Across Experts\n\nThe experts broadly converge on the following renderings (to be checked against the Dictionary):\n- 境: Transliterate as \"Jing\" with gloss (unanimous)\n- 现象: \"phenomena\" (unanimous, with note on phenomenological weight)\n- 第一实在 / 第二实在 / 第〇实在: \"First Reality\" / \"Second Reality\" / \"Zeroth Reality\" (near-unanimous)\n- 恒常: \"constancy\" (metaphysics expert), NOT \"permanence\" or \"invariance\"\n- 非理性: \"the non-rational\" (NOT \"irrational\" -- this distinction is load-bearing)\n- 诗意: \"the poetic\" (near-unanimous; NOT \"poetry\" or \"poetic meaning\")\n- 梦境: \"dreamscape\" (unanimous)\n- 沉醉的/清醒的梦境: \"intoxicated/lucid dreamscape\" (unanimous)\n- 形而上 vs 形而上学: \"the metaphysical\" vs \"metaphysics\" (consistent across experts)\n- 联想: \"association\" (unanimous, with phenomenological weight noted)\n- 泛性质/范性质: \"universal property\" (standard mathematical term)\n\n### Register and Pacing Warnings from Experts\n\n- **Phenomenology expert:** The two types of 感受 (received stimulation vs. crystallization/surge/turbulence) in Essay 5 are a philosophically precise distinction. The translation must preserve this.\n- **Existentialism expert:** 诗意 is NOT aesthetic ornamentation but an entire existential stance. If translated as just \"poetic meaning,\" it loses its weight. Must be \"the poetic\" -- functioning like Heidegger's \"das Dichterische.\"\n- **Chinese philosophy expert:** The Laozi passage in Essay 4 is NOT being interpreted as Laozi scholarship. The author is using the structure as an illustration. The translation must make this distinction clear.\n- **Buddhism expert:** 境 has deep resonances with Buddhist 境界 (visaya, gocara, ayatana) that inform the term's registers. The translator should be aware of these resonances without over-explicating them.\n- **Wittgenstein expert:** The author's use of \"language games\" is a productive but reoriented extension of Wittgenstein. The translation should not assimilate it to standard Wittgensteinian usage without noting the author's modifications.\n\n### Intersubjectivity via eta (Multiple Experts)\n\nMultiple experts (metaphysics, phenomenology, epistemology, existentialism) independently flagged the natural transformation eta as providing a structural account of intersubjectivity. The key insight: two people \"understand\" the same thing when their respective eta have the same structural form, without needing shared qualia. This is philosophically significant and should be clearly conveyed in translation.\n\n### The Closing Passage of Essay 7 / Essay 8\n\nThe existentialism and phenomenology experts both identify the closing passage of K1策略 (from poetry through memes to lullabies) and the long passage in Essay 8 about tools and jing-construction as the collection's emotional and philosophical climax. These passages must be translated with maximum force. They represent the moment where the formal apparatus connects to lived human experience.\n\n---\n\n## Dictionary Notes\n\nHaving read the Translation Dictionary in full, I extract the following editorially relevant observations:\n\n### Terms That Will Be Editorially Challenging in Running Prose\n\n1. **\"the metaphysical\" (形而上) as a count noun** -- \"a metaphysical\" sounds unusual in English. The dictionary permits \"a metaphysical construct\" as alternative. I need to watch for contexts where the bare \"a metaphysical\" reads awkwardly and flag for the translator.\n\n2. **\"(constitutive) character\" for 德** -- This is a creative solution but the parenthetical will feel heavy in repeated use. After first occurrence, \"character\" alone should flow naturally. The SPLIT convention (virtue in block quotes, character in analysis) requires careful editorial tracking.\n\n3. **\"phenomenal ritual conduct / phenomenal humaneness / phenomenal rightness\"** -- These are 6-8 syllable compound terms that will create dense, heavy sentences. The \"phenomenal X\" prefix MUST be preserved per B9 (intentional repetition), but I should flag sentences where the accumulation becomes unreadable.\n\n4. **\"feeling\" for 感受** -- The everyday English word \"feeling\" carrying this much philosophical weight will sometimes read too casual. The \"felt experience\" variant is available for technical contexts, but the trigger criterion (\"Is it naming a type of thing or describing what someone feels?\") requires editorial judgment case by case.\n\n5. **\"the poetic\" for 诗意** -- This works as a substantive but will be awkward in some syntactic positions. \"Poetic stance\" and \"poetic mode\" are available variants. Capitalization convention (capitalized on first occurrence per essay, lowercase thereafter) needs tracking.\n\n6. **\"Jing\" (romanized) for 境** -- A transliterated term in running English prose always risks feeling alien. The -scape echo system (dreamscape = dream + 境) helps ground it. The first-occurrence apparatus (glossary note, -scape footnote) must be positioned to not break reading flow (R6).\n\n### Glossing Conventions to Enforce\n\n- **First occurrence per essay**: \"English (漢字, *pinyin*)\" format for key terms\n- **-scape echo footnote**: Must appear at first introduction of Jing, explaining the morphological link\n- **Translator's notes (TNs)**: Required for 感受, 前形而上学, 境界 (at line 25 only), 沉醉, 德, and 范畴论. Must verify these don't break experiential momentum (R6)\n- **Block quote convention for Laozi**: Original 文言 in block quote with full English rendering, attribution \"adapted from Ivanhoe (2003)\"\n\n### Formatting/Consistency Concerns\n\n- **Capitalization system**: First Reality / Second Reality / Zeroth Reality -- always capitalized as technical terms. \"The Poetic\" capitalized in glossary/titles, lowercase in running text after first mention per essay. \"Jing\" always capitalized.\n- **Mathematical notation**: Must be preserved exactly. All LaTeX formulas, Fraktur script for full P, calligraphic E for subcategories.\n- **Italic/bold system from Essay 4**: Italics mark special terms, bold marks emphasis. This is the author's notational system and must be preserved per B5.\n- **The \"phenomenal X\" prefix system**: Must be consistent across all occurrences (现象礼, 现象仁, 现象义) -- never drop the prefix.\n- **NEVER translate 虚无 as \"emptiness\"** -- reserved for Buddhist 空/sunyata. Non-negotiable.\n- **NEVER translate 非理性 as \"irrational\"** -- must be \"the non-rational.\" Load-bearing distinction.\n\n### Cross-Essay Term Tracking Checklist\n\nThe following terms appear across multiple essays and must be tracked for consistency:\n- 现象/phenomena (Essays 1-8)\n- 第一/二/〇实在 (Essays 4-8)\n- 形而上/the metaphysical (Essays 4-8)\n- 恒常/constancy (Essays 4, 6, 7, 8)\n- 境/Jing (Essays 5-8)\n- 诗意/the poetic (Essays 5, 7, 8)\n- 梦境/dreamscape (Essays 5, 8)\n- 非理性/the non-rational (Essays 4, 6, 7)\n- 感受/feeling (all essays)\n- 联想/association (Essays 6, 7)\n- 泛性质/universal property (Essays 6, 7)\n\n---\n\n## Translator's Memo Notes (editorial extraction)\n\nRead the translator's full memo at `/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Memo.md`. Below are the editorially relevant items I need to track.\n\n### Translation Approach Decisions That Affect Editing\n\n1. **Title format**: \"**Jing Ji** (境集) / *Collected Essays on Jing*\" — the romanized title with subtitle. As editor I need to ensure this format is consistent wherever the title appears.\n\n2. **First-occurrence glossing protocol**: Key terms get \"English (漢字, *pinyin*)\" on first occurrence per essay. This means I will see these glosses repeatedly across essays. I need to verify: (a) the gloss appears on the FIRST occurrence and not later, (b) the format is consistent, (c) after the first occurrence the gloss is dropped and plain English used.\n\n3. **Classical Chinese quotation format**: Original 文言 in block quote, followed by glossed English rendering. The 文言/modern boundary must be visible through formatting (block-indent vs. running text). I need to enforce this formatting distinction consistently.\n\n4. **\"Phenomenal X\" compounds NEVER drop the prefix** — even when repetitive, even when heavy. This is now a hard rule from both the translator and the Dictionary. My job is to manage density around these terms, not to abbreviate them.\n\n5. **Re-glossing at register transitions**: When a term (e.g., 仁) shifts from classical quotation context to the author's modern analysis, a brief \"(仁)\" reminder is added. I need to check these appear at the right moments — not too often (cluttering), not too rarely (losing the reader).\n\n6. **德 SPLIT convention**: \"Virtue\" in the Laozi block quote rendering, \"(constitutive) character\" in the author's analysis. This is a deliberate terminological shift within a single passage. I need to verify the TN explaining this shift is properly placed and visible.\n\n### Resolved Questions That Affect Editing\n\n7. **Q1 — 诗意 capitalization**: \"The Poetic\" (capitalized) as substantive on first occurrence per essay, lowercase \"poetic\" as adjective thereafter. I need to track this across all essays where it appears (5, 7, 8).\n\n8. **Q3 — Essay 2 untouched**: The translator will NOT edit the author's native English. Three translator's footnotes will be added connecting author's informal terms to formal counterparts. I need to ensure these footnotes are editorially integrated without breaking the essay's own voice (B6 applies).\n\n9. **Q5 — Meme sentence replacement**: The Chinese internet meme in K1 will be replaced with an English grammatically-plausible-but-semantically-void sentence, NOT literally translated. A translator's note cites the original Chinese. This is an unusual editorial situation — I need to verify the replacement sentence achieves the right effect (natively incomprehensible in English, not \"bad translation\" feeling).\n\n10. **Q6 — 虚妄 = \"vain presumption\"**: Author's personal coinage, NOT Buddhist usage. Footnote disambiguates. I need to verify this footnote is present and clear.\n\n11. **Q7 — 形 = 现象 reinterpretation note**: Half-page in Translator's Introduction + footnote at first occurrence in Essay 4. This is the same TN2 I already reviewed in the DaoDeRenYiLi draft. Confirmed: it is well-placed and clear.\n\n### Glossary as Editorial Reference\n\nThe translator's core glossary table (Section 2 of the Translation Approach) contains 40+ terms with their agreed English renderings. This is my primary reference for B1 (never alter terminology from the Dictionary). Key items I will check most frequently:\n\n- 境 = Jing / E (technical)\n- 形而上 = the metaphysical (NOT \"metaphysics\")\n- 形而上学 = metaphysics (NOT \"the metaphysical\")\n- 非理性 = the non-rational (NOT \"irrational\")\n- 恒常 = constancy (NOT \"permanence\" / \"regularity\" / \"invariance\")\n- 虚无 = the void / nothingness (NEVER \"emptiness\")\n- 感受 = feeling / felt experience (context-dependent)\n- 德 = De / character (NEVER \"virtue\" outside the Laozi block quote)\n\n### Register Strategy Alignment\n\nThe translator identifies the same 5 registers I identified independently. Good — we are aligned. The translator's notes add one important detail: Essay 2's register (analytic philosophy) serves as the **register standard** for the analytic passages. This means when I edit analytic passages in translated essays, I should check them against Essay 2's natural voice for calibration.\n\n### Reference Translations\n\nThe translator has collected three standard English translations of the Laozi Ch. 38 passage (Ivanhoe, Lau, Wing-tsit Chan). TN1 in the draft cites Ivanhoe and explains departures. I verified this in my review — it is well-done. For any future classical Chinese passages, I should check whether reference translations have been similarly collected and cited.\n\n### Structural Principles — My Enforcement Checklist\n\nThe translator lists 5 structural principles. These map directly to my hard boundaries:\n\n| Translator's Principle | My Boundary |\n|------------------------|-------------|\n| Preserve experiential sequences exactly | B2 (never restructure/reorder) |\n| Preserve working-draft quality | B4 (never polish away drafts) |\n| Preserve bilingual nature | B6 (never harmonize Essay 2) |\n| Preserve fish/fishing structure | B2 (never restructure) |\n| Footnotes are philosophically essential | R6 (verify footnote integration) |\n\nThis alignment is reassuring — the translator and I are working from the same constraints.\n\n---\n\n## Expert Questions\n\n### Q1: \"Phenomenal X\" density management in English prose\n\n**Problem:** The author's coined compounds 现象礼, 现象仁, 现象义 are 3 syllables each in Chinese. Their English equivalents — \"phenomenal ritual conduct\" (8 syllables), \"phenomenal humaneness\" (7 syllables), \"phenomenal rightness\" (6 syllables) — are dramatically heavier. In the long analytical paragraphs of Essay 4, these terms accumulate 5-6 times per sentence. The Dictionary and B9 require preserving the \"phenomenal\" prefix always. But the resulting English is borderline unreadable in places.\n\n**Question for Chinese philosophy expert:** In the original Chinese, does the repetition of 现象X create any sense of heaviness or accumulation for a native Chinese reader, or does the 3-character compactness make it feel natural and light? I need to understand whether density management in English should aim for \"transparent/invisible\" (matching the Chinese reader's experience) or \"deliberately weighty\" (if the Chinese reader also feels the terms accumulating).\n\n**Status:** RESOLVED — Answer: both light individually AND dense cumulatively. Hybrid strategy: keep all repetition, manage density through sentence architecture, shape as crescendo toward reversal.

All expert amendments incorporated. Two registered non-blocking dissents on Preface edits (metaphysics-expert on Edit 4; translator-2 on Edit 3) do not affect the Afterword.\nmodified: 2026-02-11T00:26:34-08:00\ncreated: 2026-02-10T23:58:31-08:00\n---\n\n# Afterword-Blueprint\n\n## Placement\n\nAfter all essays and the Appendix, before the Glossary Introduction.\n\n**Reading order:** Translator's Preface -> Essays 1-7 -> Appendix (Essay 8) -> **Translator's Afterword** -> Glossary Introduction -> Glossary.\n\n## Tone\n\nScholarly but accessible. The translators speaking as philosophically informed readers who have deeply engaged with the work. More analytically engaged than the Preface (since there is nothing left to protect) but not evaluative or promotional. Should model the kind of cross-traditional reading the work invites. The closing should return the reader to their own experience rather than ending on scholarly commentary.\n\n## Length\n\n3,000-4,000 words.\n\n## Guiding Principle\n\nThe Preface names topics and describes methods without revealing conclusions or experiential payoffs. The Afterword discusses conclusions, draws connections, and positions the work freely, because the reader has already experienced everything. The structural principle is phenomenological: experience first, reflection after.\n\nCross-traditional connections are framed as **convergences, not influences** -- the author arrives at these positions independently, which is itself philosophically significant.\n\n---\n\n## Structure\n\n### Section A: The Collection's Philosophical Argument (~800 words)\n\nNow that the reader has experienced the essays, we name what they demonstrate:\n\n- The structural claims removed from the Preface (DRAFT-R2 line 50), stated freely and expanded:\n  - Nihilism as consequence of metaphysics (not its negation)\n  - Absurdity as structural Jing-collapse that dissolves when meaning is internally generated\n  - The bottom-up construction of the metaphysical from phenomena\n- The full progression: traditional metaphysics -> nihilism -> post-metaphysics -> the poetic\n- The Essay 3 punchline and its significance, discussed openly\n- The Dao-De reversal's implications: how bottom-up construction is concealed and appears top-down\n- The Four Kinds of Metaphysics (第〇/一/二/三种形而上) as the mechanism by which bottom-up construction operates\n- The knowledge-as-belief thesis and its relationship to the formal apparatus. **Drafting note:** Make the access argument explicit as the bridge between Essay 2 and the K1 strategy -- it shows justification reduces to belief, which necessitates the K1 approach to belief-structure evolution.\n- The collection as its own philosophical experiment: the reader who has completed it has undergone a structured experiential sequence that demonstrates the very concepts the essays describe\n\n### Section B: Cross-Traditional Connections (~1,200-1,500 words)\n\nThe Afterword's distinctive contribution -- scholarly positioning that exists nowhere else in the volume. Framed as **convergences, not influences**.\n\n**Kantian parallels:**\n- The meaning question as \"another kind of Kantian question\" (the author's own phrase in the Appendix)\n- S_E as conditions of possible experience\n- The departure from Kant's fixed transcendental apparatus toward an evolving, constructive one\n- The dispensability of Zeroth Reality (第〇实在) vs. Kant's Ding an sich as necessary limiting concept (Grenzbegriff) -- the author's Zeroth Reality loses its special position entirely through disenchantment (祛魅), enabling the post-metaphysical turn\n- The stronger claim: any articulation of Zeroth Reality constitutes it as Second Reality (construction) -- more radical than Kant's epistemic inaccessibility\n- Intersubjectivity: mention in passing as transcendental conditions for shared experience, cross-reference to Philosophy of Mind section for full treatment\n\n*(Amendment source: Kantian expert -- Zeroth Reality vs Ding an sich; Metaphysics expert -- self-undermining formulation)*\n\n**Phenomenological connections:**\n- Phenomena as starting point (cf. Husserl's Lebenswelt)\n- The relationship between Jing and intentional constitution\n- Departures from Heidegger's ontological project\n- The author's greater agentiveness compared to Heidegger's poetic dwelling\n- The tower structure (塔式结构) as the formal expression of the infinite iterability of phenomenological reflection\n- Eta/natural transformation as a formalization of Husserl's concept of fulfilled intention (erfullte Intention) -- when eta is identity, meaning-intention is perfectly filled\n- The author's 第一实在 as pre-categorical (closer to Husserl's \"manifold of intuition\" before synthesis than to Kant's already-constituted Erscheinung)\n\n*(Amendment source: Phenomenology expert -- tower as iterability, eta as fulfilled intention, First Reality as pre-categorical)*\n\n**Existentialist positioning:**\n- The Poetic compared with Nietzsche's amor fati, Camus's revolt, Heidegger's Gelassenheit -- and how it differs from all three\n- The \"livability\" of the author's post-nihilistic stance: the cat-raiser, the coin-flipper, the ritual-performer as figures of everyday life, not philosophical heroes -- contrasting with Nietzsche's Ubermensch, Camus's absurd hero, and Kierkegaard's knight of faith\n- The intoxicated/lucid dreamscape distinction as resolution of the authenticity/bad faith problematic: 沉醉 maps onto Sartre's mauvaise foi and Heidegger's das Man; 清醒 resolves the problem of being both aware of contingency and committed to one's projects. The ritual analogy (burning incense knowing it doesn't reach the dead, yet the act genuinely conveys grief) is more elegant than Sartre's underdeveloped \"pure reflection\" or Kierkegaard's \"knight of faith\"\n- The critique of Heidegger's Being-toward-death: one's own death is transcendent to oneself, therefore Being-toward-death always presupposes a metaphysical framework\n- Intersubjectivity (existentialist framing): Sartre's adversarial Look vs. the author's structural commensurability via eta (cross-reference Philosophy of Mind for full treatment)\n- The author's 诗人 (poet) vs. Heidegger's Dichter -- a significant departure with five dimensions: (1) universal vs. singular (\"我们\"/we -- everyone is a poet, not a rare chosen figure like Holderlin); (2) creator vs. receiver (paired with 创造者 -- the poet *makes*, not receives Being's disclosure); (3) self-directed vs. community-founding (\"自己生命和感受的诗人\" -- poet of one's own life, not founding dwelling for a historical people); (4) medium-indifferent vs. language-bound (any medium works -- desk arrangement, photography, cooking, memes -- language has no priority); (5) already-doing-it vs. called-to-it (\"我们已经、正在、且也将继续\" -- the task is to *notice*, not to become). The key shift: from \"How do I become authentic?\" to \"How do I notice that I already am?\" This is the capstone of the existentialist comparison and connects to the Afterword's closing gesture.\n\n*(Amendment source: Existentialism expert -- dreamscape/bad faith, Being-toward-death critique, eta as intersubjectivity, poet/Dichter finding. 11/11 voted Afterword.)*\n\n**Buddhist structural parallels:**\n- Madhyamaka middle way (pre-metaphysics/nihilism/post-metaphysics paralleling eternalism/nihilism/middle way)\n- Yogacara visaya and the constructed object-domain\n- Chan awakening stages (\"mountains are mountains again\")\n- The Diamond Sutra dream-simile and 梦境\n- Hua-yen's Indra's net (因陀羅網) and the tower structure -- mutual interpenetration at every level as the closest Buddhist structural analog to the category-theoretic framework\n- Pratityasamutpada as relational constitution\n- The author's \"already doing it\" (我们已经、正在、且也将继续) as parallel to Chan/Zen Buddha-nature (佛性) and 见性 (seeing one's nature): the insight that what is sought is already present, not something to be attained from outside. The author's universalization of the poet-figure (\"我们正是这样的创造者\") resonates with the Chan teaching that all beings already possess Buddha-nature -- the practice is recognition, not acquisition. **Drafting note:** In Chan, recognition typically requires a teacher and intensive practice (参禅, koan work), while the author's framework suggests recognition can occur through any medium -- making the author more radically democratic than even Chan. This distinction should be made explicit.\n\n*(Amendment source: Buddhism expert -- Hua-yen/Indra's net, Chan/Zen Buddha-nature parallel with poet/Dichter finding, democratic-vs-Chan drafting note)*\n\n**Wittgensteinian resonances:**\n- Language games and forms of life\n- Showing vs. saying\n- The therapeutic method and its relationship to the author's philosophical experiments\n- The natural transformation eta as giving mathematical content to Wittgenstein's beetle-in-the-box insight (PI section 293): private content drops out, structural role is what matters\n- A structural (rather than communitarian) solution to the rule-following problem (addressing Kripkenstein's skepticism and the private language argument simultaneously)\n- Note for drafter: \"structural\" here means category-theoretic naturality conditions, not linguistic structuralism (Saussure)\n\n*(Drafting note source: Wittgenstein expert -- disambiguation of \"structural\")*\n\n**Chinese philosophical tradition:**\n- The radical reinterpretation of 形, 德, and the Dao-De hierarchy\n- Xunzi's 礼论 as the closest classical precedent -- and the point at which the author surpasses it by extending constructivism to 道 itself (Xunzi argued 礼 is 人为/human-made but never extended this to 道)\n- The Zhuangzi-Huizi 子非鱼 dialogue as the classical framing of the intersubjectivity problem the author's natural transformation addresses (Zhuangzi raises the problem, the Confucian tradition assumes it away via shared human nature/性善, the author resolves it structurally)\n- The relationship to Neo-Confucian 理/气 discussions and Wang Yangming's 知行合一 (handle with care: present as convergences the reader might explore, not as influences or direct engagement -- the author never explicitly invokes Wang Yangming)\n- The 意境 aesthetic tradition and the concept of 诗意\n- The Zhuangzi's 庄周梦蝶\n- How this work departs from both Confucian and Daoist orthodoxy while remaining recognizably within the Chinese philosophical tradition\n- Relationship to the commentarial tradition (Heshang Gong, Wang Bi) -- how traditional commentators read the Dao-De hierarchy and where the author departs from them\n\n*(Amendment source: Chinese-phil expert -- Xunzi as precedent, 子非鱼 as intersubjectivity framing; drafting note on Wang Yangming caution. Editor + Chinese-phil: Xunzi material consolidated at line 109; commentarial tradition kept separate here.)*\n\n**Philosophy of Mind:**\n- The natural transformation (eta) model of understanding as the framework's most significant formal innovation\n- The other-minds argument in Essay 4 (first-person/third-person asymmetry in access to mental states as the mechanism that conceals bottom-up construction)\n- Intersubjectivity via shared eta-structure (structural commensurability without shared qualia) -- the primary home for the full intersubjectivity treatment, with connections to:\n  - Zahavi's empathy as other-directed intentionality (shared eta)\n  - Gallese's shared manifold hypothesis (shared eta in sensorimotor subcategory)\n  - Brandom's inferentialism (shared eta in language subcategory)\n- The tower structure as a model of meta-cognition (cf. Higher-Order Thought theories)\n- The \"philosophical experiment\" methodology as parallel to Varela's neurophenomenology\n- The \"basket\" metaphor and cognitive closure (McGinn)\n\n*(Amendment source: Phil-mind expert -- eta as primary phil-mind contribution, intersubjectivity consolidated here, Zahavi/Gallese/Brandom connections)*\n\n### Section C: The Experiential Method Revisited (~500 words)\n\nThe full descriptions softened in the Preface, now stated openly:\n\n- The Essay 3 sequence analyzed in detail: why the cat example works, how the progression from externalized to internally generated meaning demonstrates that absurdity is structural, not existential\n- The significance of the method: philosophical experiments that construct a Jing for the reader\n- Precedents in Mencius (孺子入井), Zhuangzi's parables, Chan 转语 (turning words), Wittgenstein's therapeutic method\n- The author's category-theoretic formalization of experiential method as genuinely novel\n- The self-referential dimension: the collection itself is a philosophical experiment on the reader; the descriptions ARE performances -- explaining the method IS demonstrating it (cf. Tractatus 4.112, PI section 133)\n- The \"two questions\" from the Appendix: \"How is philosophy possible?\" and \"How is meaning possible?\" as the collection's guiding questions, with the second connected to Kant's question about synthetic a priori knowledge (as the author explicitly invites)\n\n*(Drafting note source: Wittgenstein expert -- descriptions are performances; Translator-2 -- two questions from Appendix)*\n\n### Section D: Translation as Philosophical Practice (~400 words)\n\nKey translation decisions that embody philosophical arguments:\n\n- The 德 virtue/character split as enactment of the author's argument\n- The \"phenomenal X\" apparatus and its philosophical motivation\n- The meme substitution in Essay 7 (experiential fidelity over literal accuracy)\n- The choice to leave 境 untranslated\n- The principle stated in the Preface -- \"the experience *is* the argument\" -- as the governing translation philosophy\n- Register-shift challenges: navigating the author's movement between colloquial, technical, classical Chinese, and formal analytic registers, sometimes within a single paragraph\n- What was lost and what was gained in the crossing between languages\n\n### Section E: What Remains Open (~300 words)\n\nHonest acknowledgment of the collection's incompleteness and open questions:\n\n- The working-draft character of the Part 2 essays (todo markers, the KA conjecture)\n- The question of whether stable structures S_E have normative implications\n- The relationship to other formal frameworks (HoTT, topos theory)\n- The question of cultural relativity of stable structures\n- The underdeveloped treatment of temporality (inner time-consciousness not yet captured by the discrete evolution functor) and embodiment (the lived body as site of experience). **Drafting note:** Sharpen with Kant's account of time as form of inner sense -- the author's discrete evolution functor T does not engage with inner time-consciousness or the temporality of synthesis.\n- The bootstrapping problem (how do two E-structures become coordinated?)\n- Whether S_K can be concretely characterized (the KA conjecture is currently promissory)\n- An honest note on limits: the framework's individualist starting point may miss the essentially communal character of meaning that Wittgenstein emphasizes (forms of life, agreement in practice).

The glossing format \"(道, *dao*)\" is clear and follows the Dictionary convention.\n    37→\n    38→**Flag (minor):** The English rendering uses \"When X was lost, there was Y\" — this closely follows Ivanhoe's structure. It works well. However, the Chinese 故失X而后Y literally means \"therefore, losing X, afterwards Y\" — there is a stronger causal/sequential sense (\"and so\"). The rendering \"When... there was\" slightly softens the causality.

The translator has successfully reproduced the argumentative structure, preserved the experiential sequence of the 道德仁义礼 reversal, and handled the \"phenomenal X\" terminology consistently. The translator's notes are well-placed and informative without being intrusive.\n\nThe main areas for improvement are: (1) a few passages where English prose rhythm does not match the original's pacing, (2) some sentences that are accurate but experientially flat, and (3) minor consistency issues.\n\n---\n\n## Passage-by-Passage Review\n\n### Line 29: \"Consider the following example:\"\n\n**Source:** \"请看如下例子：\"\n\n**Assessment:** Fine. Simple, direct. Matches the source's instructional tone.\n\n---\n\n### Lines 31-34: The Laozi Block Quote\n\n**Source:** The original has the 文言 in italic emphasis on the five key terms (道, 德, 仁, 义, 礼).\n\n**Assessment:** The block quote format is excellent — original Chinese preserved, followed by full English rendering with inline glosses. The glossing format \"(道, *dao*)\" is clear and follows the Dictionary convention.\n\n**Flag (minor):** The English rendering uses \"When X was lost, there was Y\" — this closely follows Ivanhoe's structure. It works well. However, the Chinese 故失X而后Y literally means \"therefore, losing X, afterwards Y\" — there is a stronger causal/sequential sense (\"and so\"). The rendering \"When... there was\" slightly softens the causality. This is a philosophical nuance, not a prose issue, so I flag it for the translator but do not recommend a change.\n\n**TN1 is well-crafted.** The citation of Ivanhoe and explanation of term departures (humaneness vs. benevolence, rightness vs. righteousness, ritual conduct vs. rites) is scholarly and useful.\n\n---\n\n### Line 36: First analysis paragraph\n\n**Source:** \"其中，道，德，仁，义，礼，自前往后，既是从上至下。道生万物，道既是最\"元始\"的元物理（metaphysics），而有此往后，皆是生成的。因此，道既是最上者，是为形而上，而礼既是最下者，是为形。\"\n\n**Draft:** \"Here, the Way, virtue, humaneness, rightness, and ritual conduct run from first to last as from top to bottom.

The source says \"是为形\" — \"it IS the form/phenomena\" — with a declarative weight. The English \"it is the phenomenal\" lands somewhat flatly because \"the phenomenal\" as a noun is less natural than \"the metaphysical.\" Consider: \"it is the phenomenal — the form itself\" — to give it the same terminal weight. However, this risks adding content (B5).

Each link in the chain (phenomenal ritual conduct → phenomenal humaneness → phenomenal rightness → extension to others → character → the Way) is present and in correct order. The experiential sequence is intact. **This is the core requirement, and it is met.**\n\n**Assessment — Pacing:** The original Chinese paragraph is a single unbroken block of text — one enormous paragraph that builds momentum through accumulation.

I recommend no structural change (B2, B9), but the translator might consider whether the parenthetical \"(apparently)\" and \"(ought to)\" can be set off with em dashes for breathing room:\n\nCurrent: \"because phenomenal ritual conduct (apparently) is exhibited in everyone around us\"\nPossible: \"because phenomenal ritual conduct — apparently — is exhibited in everyone around us\"\n\nEm dashes create more visual breathing space than parentheses. This is a pure prose-rhythm suggestion, not a content change.\n\n**Assessment — Key phrases:**\n\n- \"the feeling that arises from within the heart when I am with another person\" — Beautiful. Captures \"发乎于心的对他人感受\" with warmth and precision. No change.\n\n- \"This feeling moves me to want to treat the other person in such-and-such a way; this driving force (*motivation*)\" — Good.

The original Chinese is also dense, so this is partly faithful rendering. However, the English lacks some of the Chinese paragraph's rhetorical urgency.\n\n**FLAG [R7 — experientially flat]:** The passage \"even though **no** actual phenomenal rightness or phenomenal humaneness appears in *my* phenomena, because the feeling that arises from within the heart and the driving force are only what **I** feel when **I** practice phenomenal ritual conduct\" — this is the paragraph's most important claim (the gap between self-experience and other-experience). In the Chinese, the emphasis is carried by the repeated bold **我** and the contrast structure. In the English, the emphasis markers (bold **I**, italic *my*) are present but the sentence is so long (46 words from \"even though\" to \"ritual conduct\") that the emphasis may not land.\n\nSuggestion: Consider splitting at the \"because\":\n\"...even though **no** actual phenomenal rightness or phenomenal humaneness appears in *my* phenomena. The feeling that arises from within the heart and the driving force are only what **I** feel when **I** practice phenomenal ritual conduct.\"\n\nTwo sentences instead of one. Same content. The period creates the pause that lets the \"no actual phenomenal rightness\" claim sink in. However, this changes the sentence structure — flag for translator review.\n\n- \"I have merely **imposed** my explanation\" — \"imposed\" is strong and accurate (套用). Good.\n\n---\n\n### Line 44: The property-to-definition reversal paragraph\n\n**Source:** The paragraph about how 仁 shifts from a property (属性) to a definition (定义).\n\n**Assessment:** This is the clearest paragraph in the draft. The translator has handled the crucial three-step logic — (1) \"all people possess humaneness\" → (2) \"all people CAN possess\" → (3) \"all people SHOULD possess\" → (4) \"only those who possess humaneness count as human\" — with admirable clarity. The bold markers on \"can\" and \"should\" exactly mirror the source.\n\n**FLAG [minor — terminology check]:** The phrase \"what a person is\" (什么是人) appears in bold in the draft.

This should be \"**what a *person* is**\" (bold \"what...is\", italic \"person\") to match the emphasis exactly. Minor but per B5.\n\n**TN4 is excellent.** Crisp, insightful, well-placed. \"This is the mechanism by which phenomena are transformed into the metaphysical\" — a fine editorial summary.\n\n---\n\n### Line 46: The reversal summary paragraph\n\n**Source:** \"因此，整个逻辑的顺序就被倒反过来。\"\n\n**Draft:** \"Thus the entire logical order is reversed.\"\n\n**Assessment:** Clean, strong opening. The rest of the paragraph is well-paced.\n\n- \"because the logic by which phenomenal ritual conduct generated 'the Way' has been **buried from view** — it has been entirely **lost**\" — This is excellent. \"Buried from view\" for 掩埋不见 is vivid and accurate. The em dash before \"it has been entirely **lost**\" creates good emphasis. The **lost** in bold echoes the Laozi quote's repeated 失 (lose), which is a lovely structural connection.\n\n- \"merely a norm, and not necessarily the original phenomenal ritual conduct that (in the explanation) arose from within the heart\" — Good.

This is a genuine editorial concern, but per B9, the repetition MUST be preserved because the accumulation is structurally essential — each \"phenomenal X\" reminds the reader that these are grounded in phenomena, not in metaphysical abstraction. The suggestion to use em dashes for breathing room addresses the readability concern without violating B9.\n\n**Overall: The experiential sequence is successfully preserved. The draft is ready for revision on the flagged items, then final polish.**\n","numLines":204,"startLine":1,"totalLines":204}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"a39386ee-7a82-4926-b528-1e75389ee83b"}

Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject.

Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n    45→\n    46→This is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of confronting the absurd through increasingly familiar examples. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n    47→\n    48→We recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.

The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n    55→\n    56→We have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n    57→\n    58→We have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2, and three translator's footnotes within it connect its key terms to the formal apparatus of Part 2.\n    59→\n    60→---\n    61→\n    62→## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n    63→\n    64→A note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n    65→\n    66→The Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n    67→\n    68→> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n    69→> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n    70→\n    71→In its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n    72→\n    73→The author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n    74→\n    75→This reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n    76→\n    77→A footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n    78→\n    79→---\n    80→\n    81→## A Note on Terminology\n    82→\n    83→These essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary, and the full rationale for each translation choice is provided in the Introduction to the Glossary at the end of this volume. Three points deserve advance mention here. First, the author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (\"the metaphysical\" -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (\"metaphysics\" -- the discipline that studies such constructions); we render these distinctly throughout. Second, two key concepts -- the Poetic (诗意, *shiyi*), the author's term for lucid engagement with meaning-structures, and the non-rational (非理性), the acknowledged ground of all rational activity -- are central to the collection's argument and may surprise readers expecting standard philosophical usage. Third, the reader will encounter two different English words for the same Chinese character within a single passage: 德 appears as \"virtue\" when quoting Laozi and as \"character\" when the author analyzes the concept. This is deliberate -- it reflects the author's argument that the traditional reading conceals the constructive process the essay exposes. The Glossary Introduction explains this and all other terminological decisions in full.\n    84→\n    85→---\n    86→\n    87→## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n    88→\n    89→This collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it. This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n    90→\n    91→Three examples, among many:\n    92→\n    93→In Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order, progressing from the mythic to the mundane. The progression itself is the philosophical payload: by the final example, the reader is invited to test the essay's claim against their own experience. The recognition that follows -- which cannot be produced by argument alone -- is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n    94→\n    95→In Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n    96→\n    97→In Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n    98→\n    99→We have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter. This is not a stylistic preference but a philosophical necessity: if the reader's experience is the evidence for the author's claims, then a translation that preserves the words but fails to produce the experience has lost the argument. In these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n   100→\n   101→---\n   102→\n   103→## A Note on Reading\n   104→\n   105→The author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n   106→\n   107→The three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n   108→\n   109→Readers without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n   110→\n   111→---\n   112→\n   113→*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation. Terminological decisions are discussed in full in the Introduction to the Glossary.*\n   114→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena.

The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Terminology\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary, and the full rationale for each translation choice is provided in the Introduction to the Glossary at the end of this volume. Three points deserve advance mention here. First, the author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (\"the metaphysical\" -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (\"metaphysics\" -- the discipline that studies such constructions); we render these distinctly throughout. Second, two key concepts -- the Poetic (诗意, *shiyi*), the author's term for lucid engagement with meaning-structures, and the non-rational (非理性), the acknowledged ground of all rational activity -- are central to the collection's argument and may surprise readers expecting standard philosophical usage. Third, the reader will encounter two different English words for the same Chinese character within a single passage: 德 appears as \"virtue\" when quoting Laozi and as \"character\" when the author analyzes the concept. This is deliberate -- it reflects the author's argument that the traditional reading conceals the constructive process the essay exposes. The Glossary Introduction explains this and all other terminological decisions in full.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it. This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order, progressing from the mythic to the mundane. The progression itself is the philosophical payload: by the final example, the reader is invited to test the essay's claim against their own experience. The recognition that follows -- which cannot be produced by argument alone -- is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter. This is not a stylistic preference but a philosophical necessity: if the reader's experience is the evidence for the author's claims, then a translation that preserves the words but fails to produce the experience has lost the argument. In these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation. Terminological decisions are discussed in full in the Introduction to the Glossary.*\n","numLines":114,"startLine":1,"totalLines":114}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"a3e68686-73cb-4644-aff6-51acbfbfe5be"}

The text represents a systematic attempt to resolve this confusion by examining how the traditional definition of knowledge as justified true belief relates to actual epistemic practices. Beginning with everyday examples, like verifying whether it's raining, the author traces what actually occurs when humans form, check, and justify knowledge. The analysis proceeds through each component of the classical definition, revealing the source of the author's confusion. In the sidenotes, the author includes observations from physics and mathematics to illustrate how knowledge functions in practice.\n     6→geometry: margin=30mm\n     7→---\n     8→# A Thought on Knowledge\n     9→\n    10→\n    11→Recently, I have talked with a friend and we talked about the idea of knowledge as I have always been confused about the purpose of discussing it. This is a short note of my current thought about it.[^1]\n    12→\n    13→Let us first start with the classical definition of knowledge: knowledge is justified true belief. Though the immediate alarm would be the word \"true\", let us first talk about belief.\n    14→\n    15→Knowledge, from this definition, is some kind of belief. There are many different kinds of belief, some are stronger and some are weaker. Here I want to give a more general approach to belief: belief is a thought of taking something as true. It is subjective, as thoughts are subjective, and therefore it is intrinsically irrelevant to \"objective truth\" (if any) as \"objective truth\" is objective. Notice that the evaluation of a belief and whether a belief represents reality needs to involve something beyond belief itself, which means this process is extrinsic, i.e., the connection to \"objective truth\" is extrinsic.\n    16→\n    17→Let us first propose an example belief for our future analysis: \"It is raining outside.\" We will use it throughout the text.\n    18→\n    19→We will postpone the discussion about \"truth\" (the truth condition). However, there are a few points I want to highlight about the truth condition. First, the use of \"truth\" here refers to \"objective truth,\" i.e., it is objective. Second, there is a lot of debate on what can be considered as truth, and there is also much debate on whether there is truth. We will stay away from those discussions about the definition and existence of truth for now, which might raise difficulties, as knowledge is usually considered an access to truth, or at least a relationship with the truth. However, we can sidestep these debates because in practice (in real life), we do not have direct access to truth; we have direct access to phenomena, suggesting that knowledge is actually a relation with phenomena, which might imply something about truth (if any). To illustrate this with an example, to verify the belief that \"it is raining outside,\" we need to (and can only) look outside to see if it is indeed raining. However, the only thing we obtain is the phenomenon of potential rain, as we might be deceived by a fancy sprinkler.\n    20→\n    21→We will now talk about \"justified\" (the justification condition). There could also be debate about the definition of justification, yet we will stay away from those discussions too, but look at how justification works in practice (in a justification that happens in real life). To start a justification, you must have starting points. The starting point must be things we can appeal to without first having to justify our appeal to them during current justification. \n    22→\n    23→One example of a starting point is a phenomenon, as we have it without needing justification, just like in the raining example, we observe that it is raining outside. Besides phenomena, the only possibilities are either justified beliefs, which are already justified from other justifications (i.e., not the current one), or truths, if directly accessible, which need no justification. This covers everything because, besides phenomena, we can either appeal to something inside our mind or something mind-independent. The former are justified beliefs according to its definition in this note, and the latter are truths. This establishes that any starting point of a justification must fall into three categories: justified belief, phenomena, or truth. \n    24→\n    25→We have now illustrated all three components of classical definition of knowledge, and we are ready to explain my take to it. \n    26→\n    27→We will first start from \"true.\" As I have shown, knowledge, as a kind of belief, is intrinsically subjective and irrelevant to truth. Its relation to truth is extrinsic and through phenomena. This therefore implies there is no truth intrinsically in knowledge, nor does knowledge directly connect to truth. In practice, this means we do not and cannot use knowledge against truth directly. In the rain example, to verify \"it is raining outside,\" we can only check our memory of whether it was raining, consult a weather report, or look outside, which are either belief or phenomena, but we can never check it against truth. The truth condition is methodologically impossible. From the perspective of truth, knowledge might happen to agree with it, but as individuals, we cannot access this perspective. The fact that we use the concept of knowledge regardless of these constraints again shows that when we use the word \"knowledge,\" there is nothing about truth in it. \n    28→\n    29→We will now move on to justification. As I have shown, justification must be based on justified belief, phenomena, or truth. For justification based on truth, it is, in practice (in a real justification), just based on phenomena or belief, as I have just shown. If it is based on phenomena, then consider the following example:\n    30→\n    31→1. Alice told Bob, \"It is raining outside.\" Bob recalls that when he came in, it was not raining; therefore, Bob rejected this claim (or Bob justifies the knowledge that \"it is not raining outside\").\n    32→2. Alice told Bob, \"It is raining outside.\" Bob recalled that when he came in, it was not raining, so Bob looked outside. Seeing droplets falling, yet being tricked by the fancy sprinkler, he rejected this claim (or Bob justifies the knowledge that \"it is not raining outside\").\n    33→3. Seeing the droplets falling from outside, Bob did not think of rain at all. His thoughts flowed among the changes of light reflected by the water. He was so sad because his beloved girl, Alice, had just left him. In Bob's mind, he did not realize it was raining at all.\n    34→\n    35→These examples show there is an in-between process that converts phenomena into belief. Indeed, to use a piece of phenomenon, we need not only to access it but also to convert it into thoughts, i.e., digestion. Therefore, in practice, justification based on phenomena is justification based on justified belief. \n    36→\n    37→In the end, if justification is based on justified belief, then it is just a second order of belief (belief about belief). This raises the question, because if all knowledge is at least justified belief, then some of it must have a circular justification, or it must be grounded in a belief that is unjustified, which, in practice, we would not use as a starting point for justification, as an unjustified belief cannot be used as the starting point for the justification of knowledge. If we do not accept circular justification (if you consider that this should not be used as a justification in real life), then this simply suggests that there is knowledge that cannot be justified; knowledge is just... belief?\n    38→\n    39→This illustrates the confusion I have about the purpose of discussing it, because in practice, what we usually consider is \"the teacher told me something...\", i.e., it is a belief of the teacher, or \"I learned that...\", i.e., it is a belief of mine. We also learned that knowledge, as people know it, changes over time (e.g., geocentrism), varies among individuals (e.g., knowledge about the Bible or God), and emerges as humans construct it (e.g., is Los Angeles part of California, what is a violin, and what do we consider as art?). Therefore, it seems to me that, in practice, the only thing that exists is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" (i.e., belief, or you can define it as subjective knowledge if you want). For example, many people hold \"1+1=2\" as a belief because they typically do not know how to prove it mathematically (they can consult mathematicians if they want to justify it). This suggests that, in practice, \"1+1=2\" is purely a belief for them if they do not explicitly justify it, yet they consider it to be knowledge. The idea of \"what each individual believes to be correct\" is useful because it can be extended to \"what most people in a field believe to be correct,\" which can serve as a definition of knowledge and is sufficiently useful for any situation where you need a definition of knowledge.\n    40→\n    41→## Acknowledgement\n    42→I would like to thank Claude for drafting the abstract.\n    43→\n    44→\n    45→\n    46→----\n    47→## Sidenotes\n    48→\n    49→### Examples of  justification bases\n    50→\n    51→This is a short list of a few examples of justification bases.

Second, in a particular field, there is usually a \"standard,\" which is essentially a set of beliefs about \"which beliefs are better.\" In modern science, the \"standard\" is typically that a better belief is one that can be justified by phenomena (using a set of rules of interpretation). This \"standard\" naturally prioritizes beliefs that are more likely to predict phenomena (i.e., its utility). People who believe in other \"standards\" that prioritize phenomena in some sense are then likely to hold the belief that \"science is making progress.\" If we wish to live a better life, it seems that we should, in practice, discuss the standards we are actually using and how we want to change them, since what we thought to be better is itself a standard.\n    76→\n    77→To see the method discussed in this note in motion, let us examine how experiments in the field of high energy physics work.

The text represents a systematic attempt to resolve this confusion by examining how the traditional definition of knowledge as justified true belief relates to actual epistemic practices. Beginning with everyday examples, like verifying whether it's raining, the author traces what actually occurs when humans form, check, and justify knowledge. The analysis proceeds through each component of the classical definition, revealing the source of the author's confusion. In the sidenotes, the author includes observations from physics and mathematics to illustrate how knowledge functions in practice.\ngeometry: margin=30mm\n---\n# A Thought on Knowledge\n\n\nRecently, I have talked with a friend and we talked about the idea of knowledge as I have always been confused about the purpose of discussing it. This is a short note of my current thought about it.[^1]\n\nLet us first start with the classical definition of knowledge: knowledge is justified true belief. Though the immediate alarm would be the word \"true\", let us first talk about belief.\n\nKnowledge, from this definition, is some kind of belief. There are many different kinds of belief, some are stronger and some are weaker. Here I want to give a more general approach to belief: belief is a thought of taking something as true. It is subjective, as thoughts are subjective, and therefore it is intrinsically irrelevant to \"objective truth\" (if any) as \"objective truth\" is objective. Notice that the evaluation of a belief and whether a belief represents reality needs to involve something beyond belief itself, which means this process is extrinsic, i.e., the connection to \"objective truth\" is extrinsic.\n\nLet us first propose an example belief for our future analysis: \"It is raining outside.\" We will use it throughout the text.\n\nWe will postpone the discussion about \"truth\" (the truth condition). However, there are a few points I want to highlight about the truth condition. First, the use of \"truth\" here refers to \"objective truth,\" i.e., it is objective. Second, there is a lot of debate on what can be considered as truth, and there is also much debate on whether there is truth. We will stay away from those discussions about the definition and existence of truth for now, which might raise difficulties, as knowledge is usually considered an access to truth, or at least a relationship with the truth. However, we can sidestep these debates because in practice (in real life), we do not have direct access to truth; we have direct access to phenomena, suggesting that knowledge is actually a relation with phenomena, which might imply something about truth (if any). To illustrate this with an example, to verify the belief that \"it is raining outside,\" we need to (and can only) look outside to see if it is indeed raining. However, the only thing we obtain is the phenomenon of potential rain, as we might be deceived by a fancy sprinkler.\n\nWe will now talk about \"justified\" (the justification condition). There could also be debate about the definition of justification, yet we will stay away from those discussions too, but look at how justification works in practice (in a justification that happens in real life). To start a justification, you must have starting points. The starting point must be things we can appeal to without first having to justify our appeal to them during current justification. \n\nOne example of a starting point is a phenomenon, as we have it without needing justification, just like in the raining example, we observe that it is raining outside. Besides phenomena, the only possibilities are either justified beliefs, which are already justified from other justifications (i.e., not the current one), or truths, if directly accessible, which need no justification. This covers everything because, besides phenomena, we can either appeal to something inside our mind or something mind-independent. The former are justified beliefs according to its definition in this note, and the latter are truths. This establishes that any starting point of a justification must fall into three categories: justified belief, phenomena, or truth. \n\nWe have now illustrated all three components of classical definition of knowledge, and we are ready to explain my take to it. \n\nWe will first start from \"true.\" As I have shown, knowledge, as a kind of belief, is intrinsically subjective and irrelevant to truth. Its relation to truth is extrinsic and through phenomena. This therefore implies there is no truth intrinsically in knowledge, nor does knowledge directly connect to truth. In practice, this means we do not and cannot use knowledge against truth directly. In the rain example, to verify \"it is raining outside,\" we can only check our memory of whether it was raining, consult a weather report, or look outside, which are either belief or phenomena, but we can never check it against truth. The truth condition is methodologically impossible. From the perspective of truth, knowledge might happen to agree with it, but as individuals, we cannot access this perspective. The fact that we use the concept of knowledge regardless of these constraints again shows that when we use the word \"knowledge,\" there is nothing about truth in it. \n\nWe will now move on to justification. As I have shown, justification must be based on justified belief, phenomena, or truth. For justification based on truth, it is, in practice (in a real justification), just based on phenomena or belief, as I have just shown. If it is based on phenomena, then consider the following example:\n\n1. Alice told Bob, \"It is raining outside.\" Bob recalls that when he came in, it was not raining; therefore, Bob rejected this claim (or Bob justifies the knowledge that \"it is not raining outside\").\n2. Alice told Bob, \"It is raining outside.\" Bob recalled that when he came in, it was not raining, so Bob looked outside. Seeing droplets falling, yet being tricked by the fancy sprinkler, he rejected this claim (or Bob justifies the knowledge that \"it is not raining outside\").\n3. Seeing the droplets falling from outside, Bob did not think of rain at all. His thoughts flowed among the changes of light reflected by the water. He was so sad because his beloved girl, Alice, had just left him. In Bob's mind, he did not realize it was raining at all.\n\nThese examples show there is an in-between process that converts phenomena into belief. Indeed, to use a piece of phenomenon, we need not only to access it but also to convert it into thoughts, i.e., digestion. Therefore, in practice, justification based on phenomena is justification based on justified belief. \n\nIn the end, if justification is based on justified belief, then it is just a second order of belief (belief about belief). This raises the question, because if all knowledge is at least justified belief, then some of it must have a circular justification, or it must be grounded in a belief that is unjustified, which, in practice, we would not use as a starting point for justification, as an unjustified belief cannot be used as the starting point for the justification of knowledge. If we do not accept circular justification (if you consider that this should not be used as a justification in real life), then this simply suggests that there is knowledge that cannot be justified; knowledge is just... belief?\n\nThis illustrates the confusion I have about the purpose of discussing it, because in practice, what we usually consider is \"the teacher told me something...\", i.e., it is a belief of the teacher, or \"I learned that...\", i.e., it is a belief of mine. We also learned that knowledge, as people know it, changes over time (e.g., geocentrism), varies among individuals (e.g., knowledge about the Bible or God), and emerges as humans construct it (e.g., is Los Angeles part of California, what is a violin, and what do we consider as art?). Therefore, it seems to me that, in practice, the only thing that exists is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" (i.e., belief, or you can define it as subjective knowledge if you want). For example, many people hold \"1+1=2\" as a belief because they typically do not know how to prove it mathematically (they can consult mathematicians if they want to justify it).

The idea of \"what each individual believes to be correct\" is useful because it can be extended to \"what most people in a field believe to be correct,\" which can serve as a definition of knowledge and is sufficiently useful for any situation where you need a definition of knowledge.\n\n## Acknowledgement\nI would like to thank Claude for drafting the abstract.\n\n\n\n----\n## Sidenotes\n\n### Examples of  justification bases\n\nThis is a short list of a few examples of justification bases.

其一]]》草稿的整理，删去了一些相关性较弱和未完成的部分。在这一篇文章里，作者用自己的语言大概记录和梳理其高中时期对传统的形而上学的一些看法。许多名词和概念和哲学传统有差别，需要读者注意甄别以免混淆。\n     8→\n     9→\n    10→## 前形而上学\n    11→\n    12→*前形而上学*[^1]，或者我也把它叫做传统形而上学，经典形而上学，是我创造出来的一个名词。所谓前，指的是相对于虚无主义而言的前，即在虚无主义之前的形而上学。\n    13→\n    14→我们将我们在当前所“拥有”的一切叫做*现象*。而在*现象*上，我们推断出一系列*现象*的运行方式/规律。我们似乎认为，所谓“现象的运行方式/规律”，既是前形而上学[^2]。\n    15→\n    16→前形而上学有一个**形式上的**错误理解，既是对“*上*”的理解。形而上学的英文，“*metaphysics*”，字面上来看，既是*元物理*。倘若把物理理解为*现象*，那么形而上学所描述的，既是产生现象的原因。然而事实上，请看上一段对形而上学的解释，形而上学事实上是**自现象而产生的**。所谓“上”，应当是我们**基于现象之上**而有的一套理解，而非自上而下由形而上**生成**了形。因此，*现象*，亦或者说我们所感受到的世界，对于我们而言，并非*生成的世界*，而是对于我们而言的“*第一实在*”[^25]。我们任何的对于现象的理解，都**基于**现象。唯有承认现象既是“*第一实在*”，我们才能够作出任何形而上的推断。\n    17→\n    18→请看如下例子：\n    19→\n    20→> 故失*道*而后*德*，失*德*而后*仁*，失*仁*而后*义*，失*义*而后*礼*。——老子\n    21→\n    22→其中，*道*，*德*，*仁*，*义*，*礼*，自前往后，既是从上至下。*道*生万物，*道*既是最“元始”的*元物理*（*metaphysics*），而有此往后，皆是*生成*的。因此，道既是最上者，是为形而上，而礼既是最下者，是为形。\n    23→\n    24→然而，礼事实上是从现象所总结出来的，我们不妨将这个**切实**的*现象*中的行为称之为“*现象礼*”，我对“*现象礼*”有一个**解释**，既是我对人时发乎于心的对他人感受，这个感受是我个人**切实**感受到的，因而是*现象*的一部分，因此我将其称之为“*现象仁*”。这个感受使得我想要去如何如何地对待他人，这种推动力（motivation）也是我所**切实**感受到的，因此我将其称之为“*现象义*”[^3]。“*现象礼*”不仅仅存在于在我对待他人时，也同样存在于其他人是如何对待他人上，我们便将“*现象仁*”和“*现象义*”作为我们对“*现象礼*”的**解释**推而广之。也就是说，因为“*现象礼*”（似乎）在我们周围的所有人身上都有体现，而我们认为（将“*现象礼*”解释为）“*现象仁*”产生了“*现象义*”又产生了”*现象礼*”，所以我们认为所有（行“现象礼”的）人都（应当）有这种“*现象仁*”[^4]。接下来，我们便把我们认为（应当是）人人皆而有之的东西，在这里便是“*现象仁*”，称之为“*德*”，而为什么会有这种人人皆而有之的**规律**呢？因为“*道*”[^24]。\n    25→\n    26→因此我们看到，在现象的层面上，*仁义*仅仅是对于*礼*的一个解释。对于我们看到的外在的*现象*而言，事实上我们仅仅看到了*现象*中的“*现象礼*”，因而我们**推断**出了“*现象义*”，续而由“*现象义*”**推断**出了“*现象仁*”，即便并**没有**任何**切实**的“*现象义*”和“*现象仁*”出现在我的*现象*中，因为**我**所感受到的发乎于心的感受和推动力仅仅是**我**在行“*现象礼*”时所感受到的，而我无法真正感受到**他人**的内心感受，仅仅是将我对“**自己**的‘*现象礼*’”的解释**套用**到了我们看到的**别人**所行的“*现象礼*”上。因此，别人身上的*仁义*，其实是由*现象*中的“*现象礼*”所生成的。但是我们在解释上却认为是由*仁*而生*义*，因*义*而行*礼*，“*现象礼*”反而是由*仁义*所生成的了。接下来，基于这种生成的*仁义*，我们便总结出来，“人都是有*仁*的”。但是，事实上是“人都是（**可以**）有*仁*的”，因为我们是从诸多有*仁*的人身上发现许多人都是有*仁*的，因此*仁*是我们归纳出来的一个**属性**（**property**）。但是我们最终对其的理解是“人都是（**应该**）有*仁*的”——或者说，“有*仁*的才是人”。因此人可以拥有的一个**属性**，在这里既是“*仁*”，反而变成了人的一个**定义**。而这些**定义**合起来，便定义了**什么是*人***——也就是“*德*”，使得*人*而成为*人*的东西。因此我们看到，事实上“*德*”也是由“*仁*”生成的，但是我们在理解上却认为，是因“*德*”而生“*仁*”：因为你是*人*，所以你要有*仁*。最后，“*德*”是一种一般的规律，因为凡事诸物皆有其*德*（我们认为他应该遵守的规律，使得一样东西成为其本身的东西），因而又将所有的“*德*”合起来，归纳抽象出“*道*”，因此“*道*”实则为“*德*”而生成的，我们却理解为“*道*”生成了“*德*”。\n    27→\n    28→因此，整个逻辑的顺序就被倒反过来。道生德，人德为仁，因仁生义，因义行礼。而这最后的“*礼*”已经不再是一开始的“*现象礼*”，因为从“*现象礼*”生成“*道*”的逻辑已经被**掩埋不见**，已经全部**失**去了，人们以为“*道*”才是最元始的*元物理*。因此最终生成的“*礼*”已然仅仅是一种规范，而不一定是最初的（解释上）发乎于心的而有的*现象礼*了。\n    29→\n    30→在实践中，这种失将继续层层下跌，逐末而忘本。上述并非对《老子》的解释，而是在这一段当中，恰好出现了这种自形而上至形的阶梯，因此将此作为一个例子。\n    31→\n    32→### 形而上\n    33→\n    34→在上述的例子中，我用了中国哲学举例。然而，中国哲学大多是有*形而上*而无*形而上学*的。所谓形而上学，既是研究形而上的学科和学问，是对形而上的学习和分析。在西方，形而上学追求的是*终极实在*，既是最终的，最原始的*元物理*——*根源*之所在。而在中国，大多数时候，我们在一个给定好的*形而上*的框架中抵达这个框架中的*至善*，追求的是*圣人*，因而一是皆以*修身*为*本*。对于*形而上*的探索（也就是*形而上学*）因而相较西方要少了许多。因此，一定要区分*形而上*和*形而上学*的区别。*形而上*是我们对现象的一种**理解**、**解释**。而*形而上学*是对形而上的**研究**。\n    35→\n    36→\n    37→在这里我将形而上分为如下几种：\n    38→\n    39→#### *第〇种*：经验的总结\n    40→\n    41→形而上的核心是***恒常***。我们需要在变化的现象之中寻找到（追求）一种*恒常*性，因此我们才能够有意作出任何有（对于我们而言的）结果的行为。有人将形而上学的基础总结为*同一*，*因果*。然而，*因果*即为时间上的*同一*，因此其本质上是一回事。我在这里将其称之为*恒常*。*恒常*的意义是一种（我们给自己的）“**保证**”。这个**保证**既是：同样的*现象*（*实在*）将会**重复**的出现。\n    42→\n    43→也就是说，我们首先认为，我们眼前的一个苹果（的图像），在下一刻，他和这一刻，是**同一个***东西*——既是*恒常*。\n    44→我们看着这个苹果（的图像）在我们的视野中变化位置，缩放，甚至旋转（旋转改变了他的图像，因而递进），我们却依旧认为这是**同一个***东西*——既是*恒常*。\n    45→\n    46→我们根据我们**眼前的**这个**具体的**[^5]苹果的图像，构建了一个（具体的）“*东西*”，也就是这一个**具体**的（我们认为是）“客观存在的”苹果，这个（具体的）“*东西*”，相对于变化的*现象*，既是*恒常*。\n    47→注意到，这个“*东西*”实则我们对我们**眼前的**苹果图像的**解释**——他是由现象中的苹果图像所*生成*的。我们把这个“*东西*”叫做“*第二实在*”。\n    48→\n    49→我们看到了数个不同的具体的苹果，我们从他们的相似之处中*抽象*出了一个“苹果”的概念。这也是*恒常*。这个“*理想的‘苹果’*”，或者说，这个“*形而上的苹果*”，是我们对具体的苹果的*归纳*（*抽象*）[^6]。\n    50→\n    51→我们把这两种恒常叫做*第〇种形而上*。\n    52→\n    53→#### *第一种*：经验的预测\n    54→\n    55→*第一种形而上*必须要基于*第〇种形而上*。他是基于*第〇种形而上*之上的*恒常*：总是发生的事情（大概率）会（在未来或者空间中）**重复**发生[^7]。\n    56→\n    57→例一：我看到了**很多次**苹果树上结苹果，苹果变大了掉下来。所以我认为苹果树**以后**也会**重复**地结苹果，他结的苹果**以后**也会**重复**地掉下来——是为*恒常*。\n    58→\n    59→例二：李四**每次**用我的东西都会送回来，张三**每次**用我的东西都大多自己拿走了。所以我认为，**以后**李四用我的东西也**都**会送回来，张三**以后**用我的东西也**都**大多自己拿走了——是为*恒常*。\n    60→\n    61→#### *第二种*：经验的抽象\n    62→\n    63→我们将第一种形而上*归纳*，*抽象*为一种概念，例如“*诚信*”——是为*恒常*。\n    64→\n    65→我们注意到，*第〇、一、二种形而上*，都是同样的两步过程：对**重复**事物的认知（这种认知是*恒常*的，因其认知正在于其**重复**）[^8]，然后将这种认知抽象理解，**固定**为一个（*形而上*）*概念*（这个*概念*是*恒常*的，因其已经**脱离***现象*而恒在）[^9]。第一步既是*第一种形而上*，第二步既是*第二种形而上*。\n    66→\n    67→所谓*第〇种*，其实只是*第一种*（步）和*第二种*（步）最简单（trivial）和基础（fundamental）的形式。第〇种更强调的是其原材料**全部**来自于（“原始的”）*现象* [^10]，而*第一二种*中，其原材料除了来自于（“原始的”）*现象*，也来自于已有的*概念*（*形而上*）[^11]。\n    68→\n    69→注意到，这种“*归纳*”，是**合**，也是**分**。他界定了什么是**同一个**东西/概念——于是也界定了哪些**不是同一种**东西/概念。\n    70→\n    71→#### *第三种*：抽象的组合\n    72→\n    73→*第三种形而上*，便是对*第二种形而上*的理解。他**连接**不同的*形而上*，又自*形而上*而产生*形而上*——也就是说，他是对已有*形而上*的一种**形式化**，因此他可能是一种**框架**、一种**价值**。\n    74→\n    75→---- \n    76→\n    77→注意到，我们提到了两种形而上的“理解”。第一种是自下而上的，例如形式为*归纳*的理解：我们看到了高楼林立，因此我们把高楼林立的地方归纳为城市。另一方面，则是自上而下的，形式为*定义*的理解：我们认为城市**应当**是高楼林立的。甚至我们可以通过再其上的形而上（*第三种*），重新定义城市，再要求具体的城市具有哪些功能和特征。这也是自上而下的。有了实践作为桥梁，自下而上将会影响到自上而下，而自上而下也会影响到自下而上。因而最终上述几种形而上会夹杂在一起[^12]。\n    78→\n    79→### 客观世界\n    80→\n    81→*客观世界*是**基于***现象*而提出的一种**模型**。按照本篇中的定义，所谓“*客观世界*”，既是由*第二实在*所构成的“世界”。即是说，我们认识中的*客观世界*，是以*现象*，既*第一实在*，为**基础**，所**生成**的对*现象*其本身的**解释**。在这个解释之中，**形式上**是由*客观世界*生成了被我们所观测到的世界，也就是*现象*。\n    82→\n    83→**形式上**，倘若一开始没有任何东西，那么**先**存在一个**真正的***客观世界*，和**先**存在*现象*，有着巨大的区别（也没有任何区别）。当我们说“**先**存在一个**真正的***客观世界*”时，*现象*是生成的，然后自生成的现象上，生成了**认识中的***客观世界*（而**不**是**真正的***客观世界*）[^13]。当我们说，“**先**存在*现象*”时，就**不**存在**真正的***客观世界*，只存在“**真正的** ”*现象*。我们自*现象*上生成了**认识中的***客观世界*。\n    84→\n    85→然而，我们毫无选择地必然要从*现象***起始**，因此*现象*本身是无可怀疑（因为怀疑*现象*就无任何可立足之**地**，任何*形而上*都自*现象*而来）的存在，所以被称之为“*第一实在*”。而我们进发的方向必然是向着二（上）而无法向着〇（下[^14]）。我们之所以要提出*第〇实在*，是为了给现象以**解释**和**理解**，因而我们提出的正是对*第一实在*的*形而上*，既是*第二实在*。于是对于我们而言，并不存在*第〇实在*，而只存在*第二实在*。当我们提出*第〇实在*时，这个我们所提出的东西就是*第二实在*[^15]。\n    86→\n    87→\n    88→#### 附录：关于本篇中“形而上”一词的一点说明\n    89→\n    90→“形而上学”一词，乃是自英文“metaphysics”翻译而来。其中，“形而上”，取自《易经系辞传》第八章第五节：\n    91→\n    92→> 是故形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器，化而裁之谓之变，推而行之谓之通，举而措之天下之民，谓之事业。\n    93→\n    94→在本片文章中，对将形解为“现象”。现象是一切的基础，因而是最下者。因此这种解释有异于系辞传中“形”的本意。如果要一一对应，还是以苹果为例子，那么系辞传中的形对应于本篇中的“理想中的‘苹果’”，器对应于对应于*第二实在*的苹果。\n    95→\n    96→## 前形而上学的讨论\n    97→\n    98→一般认为，形而上学的末路是*虚无主义*。\n    99→\n   100→在我看来，形而上学的发展有其脉络。其脉络既是对于终极实在的层层回避，步步后退，而向着实用性逐渐靠近的过程。因为愈探求，愈不可探求，因为“事实上并不存在这样的终极实在可以背触及”。随着“最高价值”（既“终极实在”）的丧失，形而上学的大厦自然地倒塌，留下的遗迹被称之为虚无主义。虚无主义不是一种有、一种主义，而是一种无，一种缺位。虚无主义不是被生产、创造出来的，正如虚空并不是被生产创造出来的，而是因为没有生产和创造了，这里什么都没有而已。\n   101→\n   102→但是，注意到，虚无主义中的大部分议题实际上是**非理性**的。\n   103→\n   104→### 非理性\n   105→\n   106→显然的，理性的目的必然要在理性之外[^23]，所以，理性的目的必然是非理性的——也就是说，理性仅仅作为一种工具而存在。\n   107→\n   108→因此我们自然的知道，**对*终极实在*的追求本身就是非理性的**（形而上学本身就是非理性的）。因此，虚无主义之所以能够被提出来（虚无主义之所以是虚无**主义**、之所以使得“没有终极实在”成为一种议题）的原因也是**非理性**的。\n   109→\n   110→而形而上学和虚无主义之所以是非理性的原因，是因为我们对*形而上*的**追求**是非理性的。因为倘若不存在任何的形而上，那么我们面对现象就没有任何“抓手”——我们就无法（对于我们而言）有意义的作出任何行为[^19]。也就是说，我们（看似理性的）对*形而上*的**追求**其实就是我们**非理性**的对*恒常性*的追求。而这种**非理性**是应当被**承认**的[^20]。因为这种非理性所造成的结果既是使得理想和现象重叠，使得我们能够（似乎是主观的）作出任何（有主观意义上的结果的）实践。\n   111→\n   112→这种非理性的由来，在追求恒常性之上，我认为还有一层，即是我们需要这种“实践”。这种理想和现象的重叠，既是“自我实现”（Self Realization，使得自我得以成为现实）——我们在现象中看到我们自身，证实我的存在，使得现象成为“我的一部分”（籍于理想和现象的重叠，我们在现象中重现了我的理想）。\n   113→\n   114→## 后形而上学\n   115→\n   116→后形而上学，必然是虚无主义之后才可以产生的形而上学。以我所见，所谓后形而上学，既是以现象为核心，承认所有形而上皆为现象之上的构造的形而上学。因此，其必须时时刻刻认识到，任何的形而上仅仅是对形的描述和建模——因此其方法论的核心必然要将形而上和现象紧密的联系在一起。因此我所见到的大道既是前述的“理想和现象之重叠”——实践。\n   117→\n   118→*后形而上学*，同*前形而上学*一样，是一种*形式化*的*形而上*（即 *第三种形而上*）。与*前形而上学*的区别在于，后形而上学对“价值”、“意义”、“本质”一类的*第〇实在*进行了祛魅：认识到对这些概念的追求来源于一种*非理性*。这一认知立刻自然导致了如下改变：\n   119→1. *第〇实在*不再具有特殊的位置，因为其特殊位置是由*非理性*给定的（直到我们理性的给定这样一个人造的目的为止，但是此时任何*形而上*都可以被如此给定）。\n   120→2. *现象*现在被放到了特殊的位置[^21]。我们意识到任何的*形而上*仅仅是对*现象|形*的描述和建模。\n   121→\n   122→这些改变使得我们需要重申如下结果：\n   123→1. 再次强调，*后形而上学*是形式化的*形而上*。\n   124→2. 在整个形式化体系中，*非理性*得到了承认。这一承认在认识上有两点：承认其（不可避免的）存在、和承认其效果（如承认人对*形而上*的追求）。这两点都我们作为人进行*形而上*的结果[^22]。\n   125→3. *后形而上学*，作为一种*形而上*，具有一种功能性：理想和现象之重叠——*实践*。这一功能性同时具有*非理性*层面上的目的性。\n   126→\n   127→----\n   128→\n   129→请读者移步至《[[形而上学后的目的：诗意]]》文章继续关于后形而上学的探讨。\n   130→\n   131→\n   132→[^1]:\t在本篇文章中，以*这样*的文字作为特指、特定的名称、引用的名称，以**这样**的文字作为强调，以这样的文字作为句子中给出的可以当作定义的段落。\n   133→\n   134→[^2]:\t这里是想要给出一个传统上的定义。\n   135→\n   136→[^3]:\t仁义礼实则是已经是一套形而上的框架了。而我们又不得不借助一些框架来描述现象，因而即便我极力尝试还原其作为现象的本来面貌，但是其仍旧是失准的。中国哲学常将仁义并提。所谓仁，是谓爱人。所谓义，是谓应当。按照形式上的理解，以爱父亲这一仁来举例。我爱我的父亲所应当做的，就是义。而这个义的具体行为，则是礼。因而义是连接仁和具体行为（礼）的那个东西。在现象上，我这里用现象仁来描述我内心对我父亲的某种（爱的）感受，这个感受使得（推动）我去做一些行为。那么这种推动力，这种“motivation”本身，就是连接我的这种感受（现象仁）和我的这种行为（现象礼）的东西，因而把它叫做现象义是合适的。\n

142→[^6]:\t在本篇文章中，归纳和抽象似乎常常混用，因而在此作出一些解释。抽象和抽象都可以理解为从材料中略去部分特定的细节，选中某些选定的共性，而生成一个概念（形而上）的过程。但是其强调的方面有所不同。归纳强调归类（选定共性），而抽象强调生成（生成形而上）。\n   143→\n   144→[^7]:\t这里的恒常和第〇种中介绍的恒常没有区别。\n   145→\n

155→\n   156→[^13]:\t而**认识中的***客观世界*也并不是对**真正的***客观世界*的拟合，而是对*现象*的拟合（以期望达成对**真正的***客观世界*的拟合）。\n   157→\n   158→[^14]:\t因为对于我们而言现象已经是最下者。\n   159→\n   160→[^15]:\t这个逻辑和先前讨论的*道*是相同的。在形式上，是*道*生万物，然而事实上，*道*才是被生成的。因此，**形式上**，倘若真的有真正的*道*，既*第〇实在*（或者更下），当他被提出就成为了*第二实在*（或者更上），因而真正的*道*不可道不可名，无可讨论无法提出。\n   161→\n

此处需要注意，更加符合道家的关于“道”的解释更类似于使得存在得以成立的那个东西。形象地说，就像是对于一幅画而言的画纸一样。在这里，我们仅仅是结构上表达可以认为“道”决定和产生了“德”。\n   173→\n   174→[^25]:

其一]]》草稿的整理，删去了一些相关性较弱和未完成的部分。在这一篇文章里，作者用自己的语言大概记录和梳理其高中时期对传统的形而上学的一些看法。许多名词和概念和哲学传统有差别，需要读者注意甄别以免混淆。\n\n\n## 前形而上学\n\n*前形而上学*[^1]，或者我也把它叫做传统形而上学，经典形而上学，是我创造出来的一个名词。所谓前，指的是相对于虚无主义而言的前，即在虚无主义之前的形而上学。\n\n我们将我们在当前所“拥有”的一切叫做*现象*。而在*现象*上，我们推断出一系列*现象*的运行方式/规律。我们似乎认为，所谓“现象的运行方式/规律”，既是前形而上学[^2]。\n\n前形而上学有一个**形式上的**错误理解，既是对“*上*”的理解。形而上学的英文，“*metaphysics*”，字面上来看，既是*元物理*。倘若把物理理解为*现象*，那么形而上学所描述的，既是产生现象的原因。然而事实上，请看上一段对形而上学的解释，形而上学事实上是**自现象而产生的**。所谓“上”，应当是我们**基于现象之上**而有的一套理解，而非自上而下由形而上**生成**了形。因此，*现象*，亦或者说我们所感受到的世界，对于我们而言，并非*生成的世界*，而是对于我们而言的“*第一实在*”[^25]。我们任何的对于现象的理解，都**基于**现象。唯有承认现象既是“*第一实在*”，我们才能够作出任何形而上的推断。\n\n请看如下例子：\n\n> 故失*道*而后*德*，失*德*而后*仁*，失*仁*而后*义*，失*义*而后*礼*。——老子\n\n其中，*道*，*德*，*仁*，*义*，*礼*，自前往后，既是从上至下。*道*生万物，*道*既是最“元始”的*元物理*（*metaphysics*），而有此往后，皆是*生成*的。因此，道既是最上者，是为形而上，而礼既是最下者，是为形。\n\n然而，礼事实上是从现象所总结出来的，我们不妨将这个**切实**的*现象*中的行为称之为“*现象礼*”，我对“*现象礼*”有一个**解释**，既是我对人时发乎于心的对他人感受，这个感受是我个人**切实**感受到的，因而是*现象*的一部分，因此我将其称之为“*现象仁*”。这个感受使得我想要去如何如何地对待他人，这种推动力（motivation）也是我所**切实**感受到的，因此我将其称之为“*现象义*”[^3]。“*现象礼*”不仅仅存在于在我对待他人时，也同样存在于其他人是如何对待他人上，我们便将“*现象仁*”和“*现象义*”作为我们对“*现象礼*”的**解释**推而广之。也就是说，因为“*现象礼*”（似乎）在我们周围的所有人身上都有体现，而我们认为（将“*现象礼*”解释为）“*现象仁*”产生了“*现象义*”又产生了”*现象礼*”，所以我们认为所有（行“现象礼”的）人都（应当）有这种“*现象仁*”[^4]。接下来，我们便把我们认为（应当是）人人皆而有之的东西，在这里便是“*现象仁*”，称之为“*德*”，而为什么会有这种人人皆而有之的**规律**呢？因为“*道*”[^24]。\n\n因此我们看到，在现象的层面上，*仁义*仅仅是对于*礼*的一个解释。对于我们看到的外在的*现象*而言，事实上我们仅仅看到了*现象*中的“*现象礼*”，因而我们**推断**出了“*现象义*”，续而由“*现象义*”**推断**出了“*现象仁*”，即便并**没有**任何**切实**的“*现象义*”和“*现象仁*”出现在我的*现象*中，因为**我**所感受到的发乎于心的感受和推动力仅仅是**我**在行“*现象礼*”时所感受到的，而我无法真正感受到**他人**的内心感受，仅仅是将我对“**自己**的‘*现象礼*’”的解释**套用**到了我们看到的**别人**所行的“*现象礼*”上。因此，别人身上的*仁义*，其实是由*现象*中的“*现象礼*”所生成的。但是我们在解释上却认为是由*仁*而生*义*，因*义*而行*礼*，“*现象礼*”反而是由*仁义*所生成的了。接下来，基于这种生成的*仁义*，我们便总结出来，“人都是有*仁*的”。但是，事实上是“人都是（**可以**）有*仁*的”，因为我们是从诸多有*仁*的人身上发现许多人都是有*仁*的，因此*仁*是我们归纳出来的一个**属性**（**property**）。但是我们最终对其的理解是“人都是（**应该**）有*仁*的”——或者说，“有*仁*的才是人”。因此人可以拥有的一个**属性**，在这里既是“*仁*”，反而变成了人的一个**定义**。而这些**定义**合起来，便定义了**什么是*人***——也就是“*德*”，使得*人*而成为*人*的东西。因此我们看到，事实上“*德*”也是由“*仁*”生成的，但是我们在理解上却认为，是因“*德*”而生“*仁*”：因为你是*人*，所以你要有*仁*。最后，“*德*”是一种一般的规律，因为凡事诸物皆有其*德*（我们认为他应该遵守的规律，使得一样东西成为其本身的东西），因而又将所有的“*德*”合起来，归纳抽象出“*道*”，因此“*道*”实则为“*德*”而生成的，我们却理解为“*道*”生成了“*德*”。\n\n因此，整个逻辑的顺序就被倒反过来。道生德，人德为仁，因仁生义，因义行礼。而这最后的“*礼*”已经不再是一开始的“*现象礼*”，因为从“*现象礼*”生成“*道*”的逻辑已经被**掩埋不见**，已经全部**失**去了，人们以为“*道*”才是最元始的*元物理*。因此最终生成的“*礼*”已然仅仅是一种规范，而不一定是最初的（解释上）发乎于心的而有的*现象礼*了。\n\n在实践中，这种失将继续层层下跌，逐末而忘本。上述并非对《老子》的解释，而是在这一段当中，恰好出现了这种自形而上至形的阶梯，因此将此作为一个例子。\n\n### 形而上\n\n在上述的例子中，我用了中国哲学举例。然而，中国哲学大多是有*形而上*而无*形而上学*的。所谓形而上学，既是研究形而上的学科和学问，是对形而上的学习和分析。在西方，形而上学追求的是*终极实在*，既是最终的，最原始的*元物理*——*根源*之所在。而在中国，大多数时候，我们在一个给定好的*形而上*的框架中抵达这个框架中的*至善*，追求的是*圣人*，因而一是皆以*修身*为*本*。对于*形而上*的探索（也就是*形而上学*）因而相较西方要少了许多。因此，一定要区分*形而上*和*形而上学*的区别。*形而上*是我们对现象的一种**理解**、**解释**。而*形而上学*是对形而上的**研究**。\n\n\n在这里我将形而上分为如下几种：\n\n#### *第〇种*：经验的总结\n\n形而上的核心是***恒常***。我们需要在变化的现象之中寻找到（追求）一种*恒常*性，因此我们才能够有意作出任何有（对于我们而言的）结果的行为。有人将形而上学的基础总结为*同一*，*因果*。然而，*因果*即为时间上的*同一*，因此其本质上是一回事。我在这里将其称之为*恒常*。*恒常*的意义是一种（我们给自己的）“**保证**”。这个**保证**既是：同样的*现象*（*实在*）将会**重复**的出现。\n\n也就是说，我们首先认为，我们眼前的一个苹果（的图像），在下一刻，他和这一刻，是**同一个***东西*——既是*恒常*。\n我们看着这个苹果（的图像）在我们的视野中变化位置，缩放，甚至旋转（旋转改变了他的图像，因而递进），我们却依旧认为这是**同一个***东西*——既是*恒常*。\n\n我们根据我们**眼前的**这个**具体的**[^5]苹果的图像，构建了一个（具体的）“*东西*”，也就是这一个**具体**的（我们认为是）“客观存在的”苹果，这个（具体的）“*东西*”，相对于变化的*现象*，既是*恒常*。\n注意到，这个“*东西*”实则我们对我们**眼前的**苹果图像的**解释**——他是由现象中的苹果图像所*生成*的。我们把这个“*东西*”叫做“*第二实在*”。\n\n我们看到了数个不同的具体的苹果，我们从他们的相似之处中*抽象*出了一个“苹果”的概念。这也是*恒常*。这个“*理想的‘苹果’*”，或者说，这个“*形而上的苹果*”，是我们对具体的苹果的*归纳*（*抽象*）[^6]。\n\n我们把这两种恒常叫做*第〇种形而上*。\n\n#### *第一种*：经验的预测\n\n*第一种形而上*必须要基于*第〇种形而上*。他是基于*第〇种形而上*之上的*恒常*：总是发生的事情（大概率）会（在未来或者空间中）**重复**发生[^7]。\n\n例一：我看到了**很多次**苹果树上结苹果，苹果变大了掉下来。所以我认为苹果树**以后**也会**重复**地结苹果，他结的苹果**以后**也会**重复**地掉下来——是为*恒常*。\n\n例二：李四**每次**用我的东西都会送回来，张三**每次**用我的东西都大多自己拿走了。所以我认为，**以后**李四用我的东西也**都**会送回来，张三**以后**用我的东西也**都**大多自己拿走了——是为*恒常*。\n\n#### *第二种*：经验的抽象\n\n我们将第一种形而上*归纳*，*抽象*为一种概念，例如“*诚信*”——是为*恒常*。\n\n我们注意到，*第〇、一、二种形而上*，都是同样的两步过程：对**重复**事物的认知（这种认知是*恒常*的，因其认知正在于其**重复**）[^8]，然后将这种认知抽象理解，**固定**为一个（*形而上*）*概念*（这个*概念*是*恒常*的，因其已经**脱离***现象*而恒在）[^9]。第一步既是*第一种形而上*，第二步既是*第二种形而上*。\n\n所谓*第〇种*，其实只是*第一种*（步）和*第二种*（步）最简单（trivial）和基础（fundamental）的形式。第〇种更强调的是其原材料**全部**来自于（“原始的”）*现象* [^10]，而*第一二种*中，其原材料除了来自于（“原始的”）*现象*，也来自于已有的*概念*（*形而上*）[^11]。\n\n注意到，这种“*归纳*”，是**合**，也是**分**。他界定了什么是**同一个**东西/概念——于是也界定了哪些**不是同一种**东西/概念。\n\n#### *第三种*：抽象的组合\n\n*第三种形而上*，便是对*第二种形而上*的理解。他**连接**不同的*形而上*，又自*形而上*而产生*形而上*——也就是说，他是对已有*形而上*的一种**形式化**，因此他可能是一种**框架**、一种**价值**。\n\n---- \n\n注意到，我们提到了两种形而上的“理解”。第一种是自下而上的，例如形式为*归纳*的理解：我们看到了高楼林立，因此我们把高楼林立的地方归纳为城市。另一方面，则是自上而下的，形式为*定义*的理解：我们认为城市**应当**是高楼林立的。甚至我们可以通过再其上的形而上（*第三种*），重新定义城市，再要求具体的城市具有哪些功能和特征。这也是自上而下的。有了实践作为桥梁，自下而上将会影响到自上而下，而自上而下也会影响到自下而上。因而最终上述几种形而上会夹杂在一起[^12]。\n\n### 客观世界\n\n*客观世界*是**基于***现象*而提出的一种**模型**。按照本篇中的定义，所谓“*客观世界*”，既是由*第二实在*所构成的“世界”。即是说，我们认识中的*客观世界*，是以*现象*，既*第一实在*，为**基础**，所**生成**的对*现象*其本身的**解释**。在这个解释之中，**形式上**是由*客观世界*生成了被我们所观测到的世界，也就是*现象*。\n\n**形式上**，倘若一开始没有任何东西，那么**先**存在一个**真正的***客观世界*，和**先**存在*现象*，有着巨大的区别（也没有任何区别）。当我们说“**先**存在一个**真正的***客观世界*”时，*现象*是生成的，然后自生成的现象上，生成了**认识中的***客观世界*（而**不**是**真正的***客观世界*）[^13]。当我们说，“**先**存在*现象*”时，就**不**存在**真正的***客观世界*，只存在“**真正的** ”*现象*。我们自*现象*上生成了**认识中的***客观世界*。\n\n然而，我们毫无选择地必然要从*现象***起始**，因此*现象*本身是无可怀疑（因为怀疑*现象*就无任何可立足之**地**，任何*形而上*都自*现象*而来）的存在，所以被称之为“*第一实在*”。而我们进发的方向必然是向着二（上）而无法向着〇（下[^14]）。我们之所以要提出*第〇实在*，是为了给现象以**解释**和**理解**，因而我们提出的正是对*第一实在*的*形而上*，既是*第二实在*。于是对于我们而言，并不存在*第〇实在*，而只存在*第二实在*。当我们提出*第〇实在*时，这个我们所提出的东西就是*第二实在*[^15]。\n\n\n####

是故形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器，化而裁之谓之变，推而行之谓之通，举而措之天下之民，谓之事业。\n\n在本片文章中，对将形解为“现象”。现象是一切的基础，因而是最下者。因此这种解释有异于系辞传中“形”的本意。如果要一一对应，还是以苹果为例子，那么系辞传中的形对应于本篇中的“理想中的‘苹果’”，器对应于对应于*第二实在*的苹果。\n\n## 前形而上学的讨论\n\n一般认为，形而上学的末路是*虚无主义*。\n\n在我看来，形而上学的发展有其脉络。其脉络既是对于终极实在的层层回避，步步后退，而向着实用性逐渐靠近的过程。因为愈探求，愈不可探求，因为“事实上并不存在这样的终极实在可以背触及”。随着“最高价值”（既“终极实在”）的丧失，形而上学的大厦自然地倒塌，留下的遗迹被称之为虚无主义。虚无主义不是一种有、一种主义，而是一种无，一种缺位。虚无主义不是被生产、创造出来的，正如虚空并不是被生产创造出来的，而是因为没有生产和创造了，这里什么都没有而已。\n\n但是，注意到，虚无主义中的大部分议题实际上是**非理性**的。\n\n### 非理性\n\n显然的，理性的目的必然要在理性之外[^23]，所以，理性的目的必然是非理性的——也就是说，理性仅仅作为一种工具而存在。\n\n因此我们自然的知道，**对*终极实在*的追求本身就是非理性的**（形而上学本身就是非理性的）。因此，虚无主义之所以能够被提出来（虚无主义之所以是虚无**主义**、之所以使得“没有终极实在”成为一种议题）的原因也是**非理性**的。\n\n而形而上学和虚无主义之所以是非理性的原因，是因为我们对*形而上*的**追求**是非理性的。因为倘若不存在任何的形而上，那么我们面对现象就没有任何“抓手”——我们就无法（对于我们而言）有意义的作出任何行为[^19]。也就是说，我们（看似理性的）对*形而上*的**追求**其实就是我们**非理性**的对*恒常性*的追求。而这种**非理性**是应当被**承认**的[^20]。因为这种非理性所造成的结果既是使得理想和现象重叠，使得我们能够（似乎是主观的）作出任何（有主观意义上的结果的）实践。\n\n这种非理性的由来，在追求恒常性之上，我认为还有一层，即是我们需要这种“实践”。这种理想和现象的重叠，既是“自我实现”（Self Realization，使得自我得以成为现实）——我们在现象中看到我们自身，证实我的存在，使得现象成为“我的一部分”（籍于理想和现象的重叠，我们在现象中重现了我的理想）。\n\n## 后形而上学\n\n后形而上学，必然是虚无主义之后才可以产生的形而上学。以我所见，所谓后形而上学，既是以现象为核心，承认所有形而上皆为现象之上的构造的形而上学。因此，其必须时时刻刻认识到，任何的形而上仅仅是对形的描述和建模——因此其方法论的核心必然要将形而上和现象紧密的联系在一起。因此我所见到的大道既是前述的“理想和现象之重叠”——实践。\n\n*后形而上学*，同*前形而上学*一样，是一种*形式化*的*形而上*（即 *第三种形而上*）。与*前形而上学*的区别在于，后形而上学对“价值”、“意义”、“本质”一类的*第〇实在*进行了祛魅：认识到对这些概念的追求来源于一种*非理性*。这一认知立刻自然导致了如下改变：\n1. *第〇实在*不再具有特殊的位置，因为其特殊位置是由*非理性*给定的（直到我们理性的给定这样一个人造的目的为止，但是此时任何*形而上*都可以被如此给定）。\n2. *现象*现在被放到了特殊的位置[^21]。我们意识到任何的*形而上*仅仅是对*现象|形*的描述和建模。\n\n这些改变使得我们需要重申如下结果：\n1. 再次强调，*后形而上学*是形式化的*形而上*。\n2. 在整个形式化体系中，*非理性*得到了承认。这一承认在认识上有两点：承认其（不可避免的）存在、和承认其效果（如承认人对*形而上*的追求）。这两点都我们作为人进行*形而上*的结果[^22]。\n3. *后形而上学*，作为一种*形而上*，具有一种功能性：理想和现象之重叠——*实践*。这一功能性同时具有*非理性*层面上的目的性。\n\n----\n\n请读者移步至《[[形而上学后的目的：诗意]]》文章继续关于后形而上学的探讨。\n\n\n[^1]:\t在本篇文章中，以*这样*的文字作为特指、特定的名称、引用的名称，以**这样**的文字作为强调，以这样的文字作为句子中给出的可以当作定义的段落。\n\n[^2]:\t这里是想要给出一个传统上的定义。\n\n[^3]:\t仁义礼实则是已经是一套形而上的框架了。而我们又不得不借助一些框架来描述现象，因而即便我极力尝试还原其作为现象的本来面貌，但是其仍旧是失准的。中国哲学常将仁义并提。所谓仁，是谓爱人。所谓义，是谓应当。按照形式上的理解，以爱父亲这一仁来举例。我爱我的父亲所应当做的，就是义。而这个义的具体行为，则是礼。因而义是连接仁和具体行为（礼）的那个东西。在现象上，我这里用现象仁来描述我内心对我父亲的某种（爱的）感受，这个感受使得（推动）我去做一些行为。那么这种推动力，这种“motivation”本身，就是连接我的这种感受（现象仁）和我的这种行为（现象礼）的东西，因而把它叫做现象义是合适的。\n\n[^4]:\t这种推而广之的别人身上的“现象仁”和“现象义”已经不在我的现象之中了。\n\n[^5]:\t而不是其他的任何一个具体的苹果。\n\n[^6]:\t在本篇文章中，归纳和抽象似乎常常混用，因而在此作出一些解释。抽象和抽象都可以理解为从材料中略去部分特定的细节，选中某些选定的共性，而生成一个概念（形而上）的过程。但是其强调的方面有所不同。归纳强调归类（选定共性），而抽象强调生成（生成形而上）。\n\n[^7]:\t这里的恒常和第〇种中介绍的恒常没有区别。\n\n[^8]:\t我认识到李四**总是**会把我的东西送回来。\n\n[^9]:\t假设明天世界上所有诚信的人都死了，人们心中关于诚信的概念依然存在。\n\n[^10]:\t此处意为“原始的现象”。在我们形成形而上的概念之后，我们脑海中的概念也成为了现象的一部分。\n\n[^11]:\t也就说，第一二中的材料是非原始的现象，而第〇种的材料是原始的现象。\n\n[^12]:\t这里的夹杂有两重意义。第一重既是自上而下和自下而上的夹杂，正如上述对城市的双重理解。第二重既是第一、二、三种和第〇种的夹杂，正如按照对城市的理想（第一、二、三种形而上）而建设后产生的具体的城市，也是（原始的，见上注）现象，因而影响到第〇种形而上。\n\n[^13]:\t而**认识中的***客观世界*也并不是对**真正的***客观世界*的拟合，而是对*现象*的拟合（以期望达成对**真正的***客观世界*的拟合）。\n\n[^14]:\t因为对于我们而言现象已经是最下者。\n\n[^15]:\t这个逻辑和先前讨论的*道*是相同的。在形式上，是*道*生万物，然而事实上，*道*才是被生成的。因此，**形式上**，倘若真的有真正的*道*，既*第〇实在*（或者更下），当他被提出就成为了*第二实在*（或者更上），因而真正的*道*不可道不可名，无可讨论无法提出。\n\n[^19]:\t假设**我**是有（理性和非理性的）目的性的。那么如果我**完全**不知道做一件事情的后果，那么做不做这件事情**对我而言**就没有区别。就像是拿手指在波涛汹涌的海洋（现象）中随手搅拌一样。\n\n[^20]:\t这种承认是出于一种目的而承认的。\n\n[^21]:\t这是基于我们（作为人）的认知而导致的。\n\n[^22]:\t这也是基于我们（作为人）的认知而导致的。\n\n[^23]: “理性的目的在理性之外”这是一个关于“目的”的分析判断：一个东西要抵达的地方不可能是他自身，否则他就不会“要抵达”。因此这句话不取决于如何定义理性。\n\n[^24]: 此处需要注意，更加符合道家的关于“道”的解释更类似于使得存在得以成立的那个东西。形象地说，就像是对于一幅画而言的画纸一样。在这里，我们仅仅是结构上表达可以认为“道”决定和产生了“德”。\n\n[^25]: 此处“第一实在”只是名称，而不是现象是否是本体论上具有实在地位的论断。在实践中，对于人而言，现象是首先接触到的、不可绕过的。","numLines":174,"startLine":1,"totalLines":174}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"2dd7fadd-d2bc-4079-8815-2b3ade0be9ad"}

I_{XA} \\in \\text{Hom}_\\mathcal{C}(X,A)) \\lor (\\forall A \\in \\text{Obj}_\\mathcal{C} \\text{, } \\exists ! I_{AX} \\in\\text{Hom}_\\mathcal{C}(A,X))$$\n    59→\n    60→泛性质的具体定义比这一定义要更加复杂，不过一般来说，任何具有泛性质的构造都可看作适当范畴的始对象或终对象。因此我们在这里使用“泛性质”一词来代指某范畴内的始对象或终对象。\n    61→\n    62→为了方便理解，我举个例子：\n    63→\n    64→#### 例子：魔法书2\n    65→我的变形魔法书上记载的魔法中，有几个特别的魔法。这些魔法能够把书上提到的所有动物，都变成绵羊。当然，这些都是分别的魔法（他们不是一个魔法），比如说狗狗变羊术，和猫猫变羊术之类的。但是这些变羊术们的共同特点就是——可以吧这本书上提到的任何动物都变成羊！（但是我并不保证可以把羊再变回去啊！）\n    66→\n    67→那么羊就是一个终对象，是一个泛性质。\n

79→我们可以考虑如下方法构造该范畴：\n    80→\n    81→0. 给定一个范畴$\\mathcal O$，我们不妨将这个范畴称之为0 元阶（0-th meta order）范畴。\n    82→1. 构造一个范畴$\\mathcal T_1$，其中的Objects（$\\text{Obj}_\\mathcal{T_1}$）为范畴$\\mathcal {O}$当中的态射。我们不妨将这个范畴称之为1元阶（1st meta order）范畴。\n    83→2. 构造一个范畴$\\mathcal T_2$，其中的Objects（$\\text{Obj}_\\mathcal{T_2}$）为范畴$\\mathcal {T_1}$当中的态射和对象。我们不妨将这个范畴称之为2元阶（2nd meta order）范畴。\n    84→3. 重复上步……\n    85→4. 我们可以停止于某一步骤$\\mathcal T_n= \\mathcal T$，或者直求至$\\mathcal T_\\infty = \\mathcal T$。\n    86→\n    87→注意到，上述的第零步是可以省略的：\n    88→\n    89→1. 给定一个范畴$\\mathcal T_1$，我们将这个范畴称之为1元阶（1th meta

((a->b)->(a->c)), ((a->c)->1_c)=\"a->c\", ((b->c)->1_c)=\"b->c\", (1_a ->(a->b))=\"a->b\"，包含一些对象之间的射态；  \n    99→> 现在考虑范畴A1’，包含对象=范畴A1中的对象+范畴A1中的射态；  \n   100→> 然后我可以继续构造范畴A2,...  \n   101→> 注意到任何A0当中的对象和射态都被和部分A1当中的对象一一对应。即是An+1 “包含”An。  \n   102→> A1'中的对象是从态射到态射的态射（因此是塔式结构）。  \n   103→> 注意到A0'和A1’事实上就是arrows-only metacategory。\n   104→> 这里的=的等价关系是可以良定义的，由于构造是描述性的，（是重构），如果不想引入等价类，可以通过选择构造哪些射态来唯一的选择。\n   105→> 要注意到塔式结构有一种“压平”的特点，正如我们在上述例子中的A0'和A1'中所看到的。  如果使用arrows-only metacategory这一点将会很显然……\n   106→\n   107→注意到，每一步我们不需要构造所有可能的对象，我只需要构造一些特定对象，只要最终求得的我们要构构造的$\\mathcal T$即可。\n   108→\n   109→我们将这两种构造方法称之为*塔式构造*，不一定所有的塔式结构都可以通过塔式构造重构出来，但是塔式结构中的某一子范畴总可以用塔式构造重构。塔式构造只是一种构造方法，许多时候，这一范畴$\\mathcal T$是一开始就是给定的。这是这就像地图和地形的关系：地形早就在那里，我们只是选择不同的方式来绘制地图。如果$\\mathcal T$已经实现给定，塔式构造是一种\"制图法\"，而不是在创造新地形。\n   110→\n   111→我们说某对象$A \\in \\text{Obj}_\\mathcal{T_\\infty}$是绝对a元阶（absolute a-th meta order）当其属于a元阶范畴，但却不属于a-1元阶范畴（$|\\text{MetaOrder}(A)| = a$ if $A \\in \\text{Obj}_\\mathcal{T_a} \\land  A \\not \\in \\text{Obj}_\\mathcal{T_{a-1}}$）\n   112→\n   113→我们说某绝对a元阶对象$A \\in \\text{Obj}_\\mathcal{T_\\infty}$相对于某绝对b元阶对象$B \\in \\text{Obj}_\\mathcal{T_\\infty}$（$b>a$）是b-a+1元阶的（$\\text{MetaOrder}_B(A) = |\\text{MetaOrder}(B)| - |\\text{MetaOrder}(A)| +1$）。\n   114→\n   115→显然的，给定一个绝对1元阶对象$R$，则任意绝对n元阶对象$A \\in \\text{Obj}_\\mathcal{T_\\infty}$相对$R$是n元阶的。我们将$R$称之为基石，当给定一个基石对象时，当我们说某对象$A$是n元阶时，我们即是说的$A$相对于基石对象是n元阶的。\n   116→\n   117→为了方便理解，我举两个例子：\n   118→\n   119→#### 例子：魔法书3\n   120→\n   121→我是一个魔法学院的教授。我那丰富的魔法知识……我变行术的对象，已经不仅仅是动物了。我甚至能够把一种魔法变成另一种魔法，实现魔法之间的相互转化……啊我还记我第一次掌握这个技巧后，学院要我将其整理成魔法书的那个下午……\n   122→\n   123→0. 我从书架上随手抽出了一本魔法书，封面上写着《动物变行术大全——终极绵羊特别版》（$\\mathcal O$）。哦！这可是我写过的第一本魔法教材，这是一个好的开始……\n   124→1. 我铺开羊皮纸，开始撰写我新的魔法书。让我看看之前这本书上开头的两个魔法……哦！是*猫猫*变狗术和**鸭鸭**变狗术。哼……多么的简单！我挥动羽毛笔，写下了——*猫猫*和**鸭鸭**都变狗狗术！这可是在之前的这本书上都没有的全新魔法！（因为之前书上的魔法并没有作用于两个动物身上都有效的魔法）如此简单的任务真是令我发笑！我如法炮制，迅速的写完了这本魔法书——《复合动物变形指南——一年级》（$\\mathcal T_1$）。有了这本书，我也不再需要参考先前的《动物变行术大全——终极绵羊特别版》了。\n   125→2. 我抽出一张新的羊皮纸，这一次，我要为那些高年级的魔法学生写下一点稍微更难一点的魔法——但是也不能太难。我看着刚刚写好的《复合动物变形指南——一年级》，脑海中冒出一个偷懒的想法。我看着先前写好的“*猫猫和鸭鸭*都变狗狗术”和“**猪猪和鼠鼠**都变狗狗术”，写出了……没错！是“*猫猫鸭鸭* **猪猪鼠鼠**全都变成狗狗术”！我如法炮制……迅速的写完了这本魔法书——《复合动物变形指南——二年级》，把他放在了《复合动物变形指南——一年级》的旁边。（$\\mathcal T_2$是两册书一起。那些出现在第二册中的魔法的绝对元阶为2。出现在第一册中的魔法的绝对元阶为1。）\n   126→3. 我按照这样的摸鱼方法，开始继续写下一本书。当然！我每次的新书都会参考我从一年级开始的所有书！这能大大提高摸鱼效率。比如说在第一本书里我写过了“*猫猫和鸭鸭*都变狗狗术”，在第二本书里我写过了\"**狮狮虎虎蛙蛙獭獭**全都变成狗狗术\"，那我自然要在第三本里写下“*猫猫鸭鸭* **狮狮虎虎蛙蛙獭獭**大变狗狗术”！。\n   127→4. 如此简单的任务！在那一个下午，我按照相同的套路，摸鱼了——几乎无数本魔法书！\n   128→\n   129→注意到该魔法教授构造新一元阶魔法的方法将会使得在最后一本魔法书中，将有可能包含将所有动物都变成绵羊的真正终极变羊术。但是不会包含把所有动物都变成狗的真正终极变狗术，因为狗在$\\mathcal O$中不是一个终对象。也就是说我们可以推断在这些书当中不存在把羊变成狗的魔法，但是却必然存在把狗变成羊的魔法。\n   130→\n   131→注意到，本质上来说，“*猫猫*和**鸭鸭**都变狗狗术”是为了帮助读者直觉上去理解高阶射态，他实际上是一个把“*猫猫*变狗术”和“**鸭鸭**变狗术”相互转换的魔法。有了这一魔法后，我们自然可以创造一个新的魔法：把“‘*猫猫*变狗’和‘**鸭鸭**变狗’相互转换术”和“*猫猫*变狗术”（或者“**鸭鸭**变狗术”）相互“加”在一起，得到一个“*猫猫*和**鸭鸭**都变狗狗术”。这个“*猫猫*和**鸭鸭**都变狗狗术”和“‘*猫猫*变狗’‘**鸭鸭**变狗’相互转换术’”具有相同的结构，因为每一个“‘*猫猫*变狗’和‘**鸭鸭**变狗’相互转换术”都可以找到一个唯一的“*猫猫*和**鸭鸭**都变狗狗术”。\n   132→\n   133→> Todo:\n   134→> 虽然是为了帮助读者直觉上去理解高阶射态，下面是一些快速的笔记，如果以后需要把这一点以更形式化的方法表达\n   135→> 数学上来说，这意味着有我们定义了\n   136→> T0': 1_a, 1_b, 1_c\n   137→> T1': \"1_a\", \"1_b\", \"1_c\", a->c, b->c\n

140→> 技术上来说，等同于构造一个coproduct（或者disjoint union）结构。唯一性由coproduct中的范性质保证。\n   141→\n   142→## 境\n   143→\n   144→### P\n   145→\n   146→在讨论形而上时，我曾为了叙述方便，引入了概念P。P即是Phenomenon（现象），也是Physical World（物质世界），或者是Physics（物理法则）。我用P以指代是任何在某理论中被认为是第一实在的东西（例如说，一些人可能会认为P除了物质世界之外，还应当加上（客观的）Spirit World（精神世界）。\n   147→\n   148→本文中，P最终应当指代现象（Phenomenon）。并且我将用“感受”和“体验”一词以指代P中的任何一个部分。其原因在于，即便对于客观世界模型来说，任何对于我们有影响的事物都必须通过“感受”或者“体验”以“进入”我们的“视野”以成为“现象”。因此“全部的感受之总和”既是现象。\n   149→\n   150→在本文中，我将用$\\mathfrak P$以指代完整的P，即是“全部的感受之总和”、完整的现象，而用$\\mathfrak p$以指代某部分的P，例如“所有我从手机中所接受到的信息”。\n   151→\n   152→### E\n   153→\n   154→以P为范例，在这里，我拟用代号E（$\\mathbb E$或$\\mathcal E$）以指代我先前用梦境（境）一词所指的东西。其意味为表示为“内部的”之意（Enclosed），也表示情绪与感受之意（Emotion与Experience）。\n   155→\n   156→### P上的E\n   157→\n   158→现在我们定义$\\mathbb E$。$\\mathbb E$是$\\mathfrak P$上的结构，我们现在**选择**将这种结构用范畴**描述**：我们**选取**$\\mathfrak P$中的部分（感受）**作为**$\\mathbb E$中的对象，其中这些对象之间的联系（称之为联想，也是$\\mathfrak P$的一部分，也是一种感受），**作为**$\\mathbb E$中的态射。\n   159→\n   160→我们同时可以选取$\\mathfrak P$的一部分。例如$\\mathfrak p$，并构造$\\mathfrak p$上的结构$\\mathcal E_\\mathfrak p$。此后我将使用$\\mathcal E$指代$\\mathbb E$或者某些$\\mathfrak p$上的$\\mathcal E_\\mathfrak p$。\n   161→\n   162→注意到，$\\mathcal E$中的态射也是$\\mathfrak P$中的部分（即感受），因此即是说，$\\mathcal E$当中的态射也是$\\mathcal E$中的对象，因此我们可以断言$\\mathcal E$的结构是塔式结构。\n   163→\n   164→注意到，你可以通过内省来**体验**和**验证**这个结构$\\mathcal E$。也就是说，如果想要获取某一个特定的感受$a$，可以以$\\mathcal E$中$a$所处的结构位置作为地图去唤醒这个特定的感受。\n   165→\n   166→#### 附言\n   167→\n   168→值得注意的是，一个更加恰当的描述是使用*纯态射范畴*（arrows-only metacategory）。通过将单位元和其对应对象等同，两者构成相同的数学结构。为了方便理解，这里继续使用常见的范畴的语言。\n   169→\n   170→在数学上，可以认为$\\mathfrak P$是某种意义上在范畴论中常使用的\"universe\"或者Large Categories，不过其边界被限定为给定的P。某种意义上，$\\mathcal E$是对$\\mathfrak P$这种“无结构的大集类”中元素的选取。选取所构成的$\\mathcal E$作为塔式结构中的对象和射态具有相同的地位（正如$\\mathfrak P$中并不区分对象和射态）。通过塔式构造重构$\\mathcal E$即是通过赋予元阶，对塔式结构$\\mathcal E$中的对象赋予了分层结构的过程。这一点将在后续讨论到。\n   171→\n   172→## 形而上：A1策略\n   173→\n   174→A1策略是使用范畴论描述境的一个尝试。\n   175→\n   176→### 联想和形而上\n   177→\n   178→$\\mathcal E$中的态射，如前所述，被称之为联想。例如说，我看到铅笔而想到钢笔，因而联想，做为一个态射，链接了铅笔和钢笔。与此同时，这一联想也作为一个对象而存在于$\\mathcal E$中，即是那个我看到铅笔而想到钢笔的那种“感受”。这种感受可能源于铅笔和钢笔当中的某种**相似性**（一般由感官的模糊性导致）。在这种情况下，遵照先前的魔法书例子，我们可以将许多种**类似**的对象（例如蜡笔、粉笔）和他们两两之间的联想当作是$\\mathcal E$中某种构造中的$\\mathcal T_1$（或者说，我们将这些对象选择作为基石），那么必然在$\\mathcal T_\\infty$中存在某种“终极联想”，即终对象，这个终对象的一个表示即是那种感觉，那种我看到这些**类似**的东西都会感受到的那种感觉（而这种感觉在这种状况下意味着某种终极的**相似性**）——我们把这个感觉叫做*笔*。\n   179→\n   180→注意到，*笔*这一概念是一种对具体的、个别的笔（例如铅笔、或者例如这支我拿在手上的笔）的*形而上*。推而广之，我们给出*形而上*的如下定义：\n   181→\n   182→> 一个*形而上*$m$是$\\mathcal E$中的联想，且$m$在$\\mathcal E$的某个子范畴中是范性质。我们将这个子范畴记作$\\mathcal E_m$，简记成$\\mathcal M$。\n   183→\n   184→注意到，不是所有子范畴内都存在范性质。\n   185→\n   186→#### 例子：忒修斯之船\n   187→\n   188→什么是忒修斯之船（忒修斯之船的本质是什么）？忒修斯之船即是那个我们看到任意的“忒修斯之船的碎片或关联物”（如船的部件）都会联想到的东西（体验）、或是当我们提到时会联想到所有的“忒修斯之船的碎片或关联物”的那个东西（体验）。也就是说，他是某一个体验（$\\mathfrak p_{Theseus}$中的一部分），某一个和这艘船（$\\mathfrak p_{\\text{Theseus}}$中的一部分）上的所有部件都相关的体验。这个特定的体验即是关于忒修斯之船 的$\\mathcal E_{\\text{Theseus}}$的泛性质，是当我们提到忒修斯之船时的“本质”。\n   189→\n   190→如果我们将物理世界作为$\\mathfrak P$，我们可以定义物质意义上的$\\mathcal E$。此时$\\mathcal E$当中的全部对象即是任意忒修斯之船的部分（例如说甲板，和甲板上的这一块和那一块木板，和船舵）。注意到，此时空总是$\\mathcal E$中的对象，也是他的子范畴中的对象。我们不妨将包含关系当作$\\mathcal E$上的态射（他作为对象是什么？），那么此时，_忒修斯之船_（我在这里使用了简记，用*忒修斯之船*以指代$\\mathcal E_{\\text{Theseus}}$）的范性质有两种：始对象即是完整的忒修斯之船（包含了任何一个对象）、终对象即是空（被任何对象所包含）。因此，在如此选定的$\\mathfrak P$上，我们必然会出现忒修斯悖论：\n   191→\n   192→> 如果忒修斯的船上的木头逐渐被替换，直到所有的木头都不是原来的木头，那这艘船还是原来的那艘船吗？\n   193→\n   194→并且我们会得到忒修斯之船的本质即是无这样的谬论——因为无确实是*忒修斯之船*的范性质。这一悖论的原因即是我们对$\\mathfrak P$的错误选取——$\\mathfrak P$应当被选择为现象而非物理世界，因为*忒修斯之船*之形而上并不存在于物理世界，而存在于我们的脑海之中。\n   195→\n   196→同样的，我们注意到，当我们选取$\\mathfrak P$为现象时，$\\mathcal E$上的态射不应单独的选择为包含关系。例如说，当我们追问我是谁的时候，我们常常把自己的特征去掉（如果我不会弹钢琴了，我还是我么？），直至最后得到了“空”这样的答案。倘若以范性质以描述我，“我”是那个感受，那个当你提到任何有关我的方面时，都会让我联想到的那个感受，这个感受即是我。\n   197→\n   198→练习：试分析秃头悖论：当一个人少了多少根头发，我们会认为他秃了？\n   199→\n   200→#### 例子：什么是人？\n   201→\n   202→另外一个例子是“什么是人”。“人”即是当你看到所有你认为是人的时候所想到的，感受到的那个感觉，那个感觉就告诉了你什么是“人”。\n   203→\n   204→但是我们常常还会想要一些更多关于我们认为什么是“人”的信息。那么我们自然可以探索，在以这个感觉作为范性质（形而上）的子范畴中，那些元阶介于这一感觉和看到具体的人之间的那些感受和东西，例如说，有什么样的手、有什么样的脸、有什么样的社会性，等等。\n   205→\n   206→要注意到，这一回答不是本体论的回答，而是实践上的回答：这就是我们在描述我们所认为的“什么是人”的时候唯一能做的事情，正如当小孩问他们的父母，“什么是人？”时，他的父母唯一能做的一样。\n   207→\n   208→#### 例子：对象化（Objectification）\n   209→\n   210→当工人创造其工作成果时，这一行为有时会用对象化一词来形容。有的时候，工人的劳动成果被看作是工人的“我”的一部分。在这个时候，所谓“我的一部分”，其意义在于生产成果是工人认识自身的一种途径：人在劳动成果中“认出自己”，由此，成果不仅属于人，而且是人的延伸，构成人的“现实的我”。\n   211→\n   212→我们在这里提出一种新的，类似的对象化。回想，按照我们的定义：\n   213→\n   214→> “我”是那个感受，那个当你提到任何有关我的方面时，都会让我联想到的那个感受，这个感受即是我。\n   215→\n   216→当工人看到自己的产品时，会感受到这个东西其中自己倾注其中的具体工作和努力，由此会体验和联想到“我”的感受。正如当我们想到我们的身体时，激活了“我”的感受一样，这个产品也成为了“我”的一部分，加入了以“我”作为范性质（形而上）的子范畴中。\n   217→\n   218→### 元阶？\n   219→\n   220→我们注意到，$\\mathcal E$是$\\mathfrak p$上的结构，即是说，$\\mathcal E$是描述性的，是一种对$\\mathfrak p$的理解，而非构造性的，一种对$\\mathfrak p$的定义。也就是说，我们所面对的$\\mathcal E$（几乎）是不区分元阶的。请看如下例子：\n   221→\n   222→#### 例子：龙血\n   223→\n   224→>生活在魔法之都的约翰出生于炼金世家，从小他就对各种炼金原料了如指掌：例如说人血和龙血。在他的眼中，人血就是人的血、而龙血就是龙的血。他们都是血，只是从不同的生物身上得道而已。\n   225→\n   226→我们可以说，人、龙、血对于约翰都是同一元阶的，倘若我们将人、龙、血，作为基石，那么显然，人、龙、血都是1元阶对象；而人血和龙血则都是2元阶对象。\n   227→\n   228→>在遥远的北方，有着一座被巨龙统治的小镇。卢克打小就生活在此，在他的印象中，龙是不可战胜，无可损伤的，然而在龙的压迫下，镇民的生活一日不如一日，反抗的低语此起彼伏，但是却没有人胆敢攻击那无可战胜的龙。然而，卢克有一日却忽然意识到——他从未见过龙受过伤……但是龙血应该也是存在的吧？就和人血一样？ （to do：not a good example）\n   229→\n   230→我们可以说，人血、龙对于卢克都是同1元阶的，倘若我们将人血、龙作为基石，那么显然，人血、龙都是1元阶对象；而根据人血和龙而联想到的龙血，则是2元阶对象。\n   231→\n   232→> 在过了许久之后，卢克和镇民们已经成功反抗的龙的统治，用一把黑剑刺入了龙的心脏。在卢克的晚年，龙血对于他而言已经没有什么特别的了。龙血只是龙的血而已，正如人血只是人的血而已，龙和人一样，都只是会受伤的生物罢了。\n   233→\n   234→我们可以说，此时，人、龙、血对于卢克都是同一元阶的，倘若我们将人、龙、血，作为基石，那么显然，人、龙、血都是1元阶对象；而人血和龙血则都是2元阶对象。\n   235→\n   236→----\n   237→\n   238→为什么会产生这种无法区分元阶的情况呢？其原因在于元阶的定义依赖于第一章所介绍的构造方法，$\\mathcal T_n$总是由$\\mathcal T_{n-1}$所*生成*的，给定某种构造，我们才可以定义元阶——或者说，当我们给对象指定元阶时，我们就确定了一组特定的构造方法。但是$\\mathcal E$本身并不是被构造出来的，**$\\mathcal E$是$\\mathfrak p$上的结构**，而不是$\\mathfrak p$是$\\mathcal E$的结果。\n   239→\n   240→我们并不能够直接说*笔*的概念生成了*铅笔*，因为我们可能先知道了铅笔，然后将许多笔抽象，得到了笔的概念，我们也不能够直接说*铅笔*的概念生成了*笔*，因为可能我之前见过许多笔，有了笔的概念，但是却没有见到过铅笔，于是用*笔*的概念想到了一种特别的用石墨做芯的笔（也就是铅笔）。\n   241→\n   242→###  构造（Construction）和形而上学\n   243→\n   244→那么我们为什么要关心元阶呢？因为形而上学：\n   245→\n   246→> 一个$\\mathcal E_m = \\mathcal M$上的构造$\\{\\mathcal T_n^m\\}=\\{\\mathcal T_n\\}^m$(右上角角标$m$用以标记其结果$\\mathcal T_\\infty^m = \\mathcal T^m=\\mathcal M$

I_{XA} \\in \\text{Hom}_\\mathcal{C}(X,A)) \\lor (\\forall A \\in \\text{Obj}_\\mathcal{C} \\text{, } \\exists ! I_{AX} \\in\\text{Hom}_\\mathcal{C}(A,X))$$\n\n泛性质的具体定义比这一定义要更加复杂，不过一般来说，任何具有泛性质的构造都可看作适当范畴的始对象或终对象。因此我们在这里使用“泛性质”一词来代指某范畴内的始对象或终对象。\n\n为了方便理解，我举个例子：\n\n#### 例子：魔法书2\n我的变形魔法书上记载的魔法中，有几个特别的魔法。这些魔法能够把书上提到的所有动物，都变成绵羊。当然，这些都是分别的魔法（他们不是一个魔法），比如说狗狗变羊术，和猫猫变羊术之类的。但是这些变羊术们的共同特点就是——可以吧这本书上提到的任何动物都变成羊！（但是我并不保证可以把羊再变回去啊！）\n\n那么羊就是一个终对象，是一个泛性质。\n\n## 自构结构\n\n### 简写\n\n给定一个范畴$\\mathcal O$，如果我们可以定义一个子范畴$\\mathcal O_A$（即是任意在范畴$\\mathcal O_A$中的对象和态射都依次是范畴$\\mathcal O$中的对象和态射），并且这个子范畴当中存在泛性质$A$。我们将这个子范畴称之为$\\mathcal A$。\n\n### 塔式结构\n\n考虑范畴$\\mathcal T$，其中的对象是从态射到态射的态射。那么该范畴当中的态射自然也是从态射到态射的态射，因此该范畴中的态射同时也是该范畴中的对象。\n\n我们可以考虑如下方法构造该范畴：\n\n0. 给定一个范畴$\\mathcal O$，我们不妨将这个范畴称之为0 元阶（0-th meta order）范畴。\n1. 构造一个范畴$\\mathcal T_1$，其中的Objects（$\\text{Obj}_\\mathcal{T_1}$）为范畴$\\mathcal {O}$当中的态射。我们不妨将这个范畴称之为1元阶（1st meta order）范畴。\n2. 构造一个范畴$\\mathcal T_2$，其中的Objects（$\\text{Obj}_\\mathcal{T_2}$）为范畴$\\mathcal {T_1}$当中的态射和对象。我们不妨将这个范畴称之为2元阶（2nd meta order）范畴。\n3. 重复上步……\n4. 我们可以停止于某一步骤$\\mathcal T_n= \\mathcal T$，或者直求至$\\mathcal T_\\infty = \\mathcal T$。\n\n注意到，上述的第零步是可以省略的：\n\n1. 给定一个范畴$\\mathcal T_1$，我们将这个范畴称之为1元阶（1th meta order）范畴。\n2. 构造一个范畴$\\mathcal T_2$，其中的Objects（$\\text{Obj}_\\mathcal{T_2}$）为范畴$\\mathcal {T_1}$当中的态射和对象。我们将这个范畴称之为2元阶（2nd meta order）范畴。\n3. 重复上步……\n4. 我们可以停止于某一步骤$\\mathcal T_n= \\mathcal T$，或者直求至$\\mathcal T_\\infty = \\mathcal T$。\n\n> Todo: \n> 或许一个例子可以说明，我把一个简单的例子记录在此：  \n> 考虑一个范畴A0,包含对象a, b, c，射态1_a, 1_b, 1_c, a->b, a->c, b->c；  \n> 现在考虑一个范畴A0'，包含对象1_a, 1_b, 1_c, a->b, a->c, b->c；  \n> 现在考虑一个范畴A1，包含对象(1_a->1_a) = \"1_a\", (same for b and c), (a->b)->1_a, (a->b)->1_c, ((a->b)->1_b) = \"a->b\", ((a->b)->(b->c)) , ((a->b)->(a->c)), ((a->c)->1_c)=\"a->c\", ((b->c)->1_c)=\"b->c\", (1_a ->(a->b))=\"a->b\"，包含一些对象之间的射态；  \n> 现在考虑范畴A1’，包含对象=范畴A1中的对象+范畴A1中的射态；  \n> 然后我可以继续构造范畴A2,...  \n> 注意到任何A0当中的对象和射态都被和部分A1当中的对象一一对应。即是An+1 “包含”An。  \n> A1'中的对象是从态射到态射的态射（因此是塔式结构）。  \n> 注意到A0'和A1’事实上就是arrows-only metacategory。\n> 这里的=的等价关系是可以良定义的，由于构造是描述性的，（是重构），如果不想引入等价类，可以通过选择构造哪些射态来唯一的选择。\n> 要注意到塔式结构有一种“压平”的特点，正如我们在上述例子中的A0'和A1'中所看到的。  如果使用arrows-only metacategory这一点将会很显然……\n\n注意到，每一步我们不需要构造所有可能的对象，我只需要构造一些特定对象，只要最终求得的我们要构构造的$\\mathcal T$即可。\n\n我们将这两种构造方法称之为*塔式构造*，不一定所有的塔式结构都可以通过塔式构造重构出来，但是塔式结构中的某一子范畴总可以用塔式构造重构。塔式构造只是一种构造方法，许多时候，这一范畴$\\mathcal T$是一开始就是给定的。这是这就像地图和地形的关系：地形早就在那里，我们只是选择不同的方式来绘制地图。如果$\\mathcal T$已经实现给定，塔式构造是一种\"制图法\"，而不是在创造新地形。\n\n我们说某对象$A \\in \\text{Obj}_\\mathcal{T_\\infty}$是绝对a元阶（absolute a-th meta order）当其属于a元阶范畴，但却不属于a-1元阶范畴（$|\\text{MetaOrder}(A)| = a$ if $A \\in \\text{Obj}_\\mathcal{T_a} \\land  A \\not \\in \\text{Obj}_\\mathcal{T_{a-1}}$）\n\n我们说某绝对a元阶对象$A \\in \\text{Obj}_\\mathcal{T_\\infty}$相对于某绝对b元阶对象$B \\in \\text{Obj}_\\mathcal{T_\\infty}$（$b>a$）是b-a+1元阶的（$\\text{MetaOrder}_B(A) = |\\text{MetaOrder}(B)| - |\\text{MetaOrder}(A)| +1$）。\n\n显然的，给定一个绝对1元阶对象$R$，则任意绝对n元阶对象$A \\in \\text{Obj}_\\mathcal{T_\\infty}$相对$R$是n元阶的。我们将$R$称之为基石，当给定一个基石对象时，当我们说某对象$A$是n元阶时，我们即是说的$A$相对于基石对象是n元阶的。\n\n为了方便理解，我举两个例子：\n\n#### 例子：魔法书3\n\n我是一个魔法学院的教授。我那丰富的魔法知识……我变行术的对象，已经不仅仅是动物了。我甚至能够把一种魔法变成另一种魔法，实现魔法之间的相互转化……啊我还记我第一次掌握这个技巧后，学院要我将其整理成魔法书的那个下午……\n\n0. 我从书架上随手抽出了一本魔法书，封面上写着《动物变行术大全——终极绵羊特别版》（$\\mathcal O$）。哦！这可是我写过的第一本魔法教材，这是一个好的开始……\n1. 我铺开羊皮纸，开始撰写我新的魔法书。让我看看之前这本书上开头的两个魔法……哦！是*猫猫*变狗术和**鸭鸭**变狗术。哼……多么的简单！我挥动羽毛笔，写下了——*猫猫*和**鸭鸭**都变狗狗术！这可是在之前的这本书上都没有的全新魔法！（因为之前书上的魔法并没有作用于两个动物身上都有效的魔法）如此简单的任务真是令我发笑！我如法炮制，迅速的写完了这本魔法书——《复合动物变形指南——一年级》（$\\mathcal T_1$）。有了这本书，我也不再需要参考先前的《动物变行术大全——终极绵羊特别版》了。\n2. 我抽出一张新的羊皮纸，这一次，我要为那些高年级的魔法学生写下一点稍微更难一点的魔法——但是也不能太难。我看着刚刚写好的《复合动物变形指南——一年级》，脑海中冒出一个偷懒的想法。我看着先前写好的“*猫猫和鸭鸭*都变狗狗术”和“**猪猪和鼠鼠**都变狗狗术”，写出了……没错！是“*猫猫鸭鸭* **猪猪鼠鼠**全都变成狗狗术”！我如法炮制……迅速的写完了这本魔法书——《复合动物变形指南——二年级》，把他放在了《复合动物变形指南——一年级》的旁边。（$\\mathcal T_2$是两册书一起。那些出现在第二册中的魔法的绝对元阶为2。出现在第一册中的魔法的绝对元阶为1。）\n3. 我按照这样的摸鱼方法，开始继续写下一本书。当然！我每次的新书都会参考我从一年级开始的所有书！这能大大提高摸鱼效率。比如说在第一本书里我写过了“*猫猫和鸭鸭*都变狗狗术”，在第二本书里我写过了\"**狮狮虎虎蛙蛙獭獭**全都变成狗狗术\"，那我自然要在第三本里写下“*猫猫鸭鸭* **狮狮虎虎蛙蛙獭獭**大变狗狗术”！。\n4. 如此简单的任务！在那一个下午，我按照相同的套路，摸鱼了——几乎无数本魔法书！\n\n注意到该魔法教授构造新一元阶魔法的方法将会使得在最后一本魔法书中，将有可能包含将所有动物都变成绵羊的真正终极变羊术。但是不会包含把所有动物都变成狗的真正终极变狗术，因为狗在$\\mathcal O$中不是一个终对象。也就是说我们可以推断在这些书当中不存在把羊变成狗的魔法，但是却必然存在把狗变成羊的魔法。\n\n注意到，本质上来说，“*猫猫*和**鸭鸭**都变狗狗术”是为了帮助读者直觉上去理解高阶射态，他实际上是一个把“*猫猫*变狗术”和“**鸭鸭**变狗术”相互转换的魔法。有了这一魔法后，我们自然可以创造一个新的魔法：把“‘*猫猫*变狗’和‘**鸭鸭**变狗’相互转换术”和“*猫猫*变狗术”（或者“**鸭鸭**变狗术”）相互“加”在一起，得到一个“*猫猫*和**鸭鸭**都变狗狗术”。这个“*猫猫*和**鸭鸭**都变狗狗术”和“‘*猫猫*变狗’‘**鸭鸭**变狗’相互转换术’”具有相同的结构，因为每一个“‘*猫猫*变狗’和‘**鸭鸭**变狗’相互转换术”都可以找到一个唯一的“*猫猫*和**鸭鸭**都变狗狗术”。\n\n> Todo:\n> 虽然是为了帮助读者直觉上去理解高阶射态，下面是一些快速的笔记，如果以后需要把这一点以更形式化的方法表达\n> 数学上来说，这意味着有我们定义了\n> T0': 1_a, 1_b, 1_c\n> T1': \"1_a\", \"1_b\", \"1_c\", a->c, b->c\n> T2': \"1_a\", \"1_b\", \"1_c\", \"a->c\", \"b->c\", (a->c)->(b->c)\n> 也就是说，给定(a->c)->(b->c)，我们可以构建一个唯一的射态({a$\\sqcup$b}->c)，根据输入的不同，如果输入a，则使用a->c，如果输入b，则使用((a->c)->(b->c))(a->c)。\n> 技术上来说，等同于构造一个coproduct（或者disjoint union）结构。唯一性由coproduct中的范性质保证。\n\n## 境\n\n### P\n\n在讨论形而上时，我曾为了叙述方便，引入了概念P。P即是Phenomenon（现象），也是Physical World（物质世界），或者是Physics（物理法则）。我用P以指代是任何在某理论中被认为是第一实在的东西（例如说，一些人可能会认为P除了物质世界之外，还应当加上（客观的）Spirit World（精神世界）。\n\n本文中，P最终应当指代现象（Phenomenon）。并且我将用“感受”和“体验”一词以指代P中的任何一个部分。其原因在于，即便对于客观世界模型来说，任何对于我们有影响的事物都必须通过“感受”或者“体验”以“进入”我们的“视野”以成为“现象”。因此“全部的感受之总和”既是现象。\n\n在本文中，我将用$\\mathfrak P$以指代完整的P，即是“全部的感受之总和”、完整的现象，而用$\\mathfrak p$以指代某部分的P，例如“所有我从手机中所接受到的信息”。\n\n### E\n\n以P为范例，在这里，我拟用代号E（$\\mathbb E$或$\\mathcal E$）以指代我先前用梦境（境）一词所指的东西。其意味为表示为“内部的”之意（Enclosed），也表示情绪与感受之意（Emotion与Experience）。\n\n### P上的E\n\n现在我们定义$\\mathbb E$。$\\mathbb E$是$\\mathfrak P$上的结构，我们现在**选择**将这种结构用范畴**描述**：我们**选取**$\\mathfrak P$中的部分（感受）**作为**$\\mathbb E$中的对象，其中这些对象之间的联系（称之为联想，也是$\\mathfrak P$的一部分，也是一种感受），**作为**$\\mathbb E$中的态射。\n\n我们同时可以选取$\\mathfrak P$的一部分。例如$\\mathfrak p$，并构造$\\mathfrak p$上的结构$\\mathcal E_\\mathfrak p$。此后我将使用$\\mathcal E$指代$\\mathbb E$或者某些$\\mathfrak p$上的$\\mathcal E_\\mathfrak p$。\n\n注意到，$\\mathcal E$中的态射也是$\\mathfrak P$中的部分（即感受），因此即是说，$\\mathcal E$当中的态射也是$\\mathcal E$中的对象，因此我们可以断言$\\mathcal E$的结构是塔式结构。\n\n注意到，你可以通过内省来**体验**和**验证**这个结构$\\mathcal E$。也就是说，如果想要获取某一个特定的感受$a$，可以以$\\mathcal E$中$a$所处的结构位置作为地图去唤醒这个特定的感受。\n\n#### 附言\n\n值得注意的是，一个更加恰当的描述是使用*纯态射范畴*（arrows-only metacategory）。通过将单位元和其对应对象等同，两者构成相同的数学结构。为了方便理解，这里继续使用常见的范畴的语言。\n\n在数学上，可以认为$\\mathfrak P$是某种意义上在范畴论中常使用的\"universe\"或者Large Categories，不过其边界被限定为给定的P。某种意义上，$\\mathcal E$是对$\\mathfrak P$这种“无结构的大集类”中元素的选取。选取所构成的$\\mathcal E$作为塔式结构中的对象和射态具有相同的地位（正如$\\mathfrak P$中并不区分对象和射态）。通过塔式构造重构$\\mathcal E$即是通过赋予元阶，对塔式结构$\\mathcal E$中的对象赋予了分层结构的过程。这一点将在后续讨论到。\n\n## 形而上：A1策略\n\nA1策略是使用范畴论描述境的一个尝试。\n\n### 联想和形而上\n\n$\\mathcal E$中的态射，如前所述，被称之为联想。例如说，我看到铅笔而想到钢笔，因而联想，做为一个态射，链接了铅笔和钢笔。与此同时，这一联想也作为一个对象而存在于$\\mathcal E$中，即是那个我看到铅笔而想到钢笔的那种“感受”。这种感受可能源于铅笔和钢笔当中的某种**相似性**（一般由感官的模糊性导致）。在这种情况下，遵照先前的魔法书例子，我们可以将许多种**类似**的对象（例如蜡笔、粉笔）和他们两两之间的联想当作是$\\mathcal E$中某种构造中的$\\mathcal T_1$（或者说，我们将这些对象选择作为基石），那么必然在$\\mathcal T_\\infty$中存在某种“终极联想”，即终对象，这个终对象的一个表示即是那种感觉，那种我看到这些**类似**的东西都会感受到的那种感觉（而这种感觉在这种状况下意味着某种终极的**相似性**）——我们把这个感觉叫做*笔*。\n\n注意到，*笔*这一概念是一种对具体的、个别的笔（例如铅笔、或者例如这支我拿在手上的笔）的*形而上*。推而广之，我们给出*形而上*的如下定义：\n\n> 一个*形而上*$m$是$\\mathcal E$中的联想，且$m$在$\\mathcal E$的某个子范畴中是范性质。我们将这个子范畴记作$\\mathcal E_m$，简记成$\\mathcal M$。\n\n注意到，不是所有子范畴内都存在范性质。\n\n#### 例子：忒修斯之船\n\n什么是忒修斯之船（忒修斯之船的本质是什么）？忒修斯之船即是那个我们看到任意的“忒修斯之船的碎片或关联物”（如船的部件）都会联想到的东西（体验）、或是当我们提到时会联想到所有的“忒修斯之船的碎片或关联物”的那个东西（体验）。也就是说，他是某一个体验（$\\mathfrak p_{Theseus}$中的一部分），某一个和这艘船（$\\mathfrak p_{\\text{Theseus}}$中的一部分）上的所有部件都相关的体验。这个特定的体验即是关于忒修斯之船 的$\\mathcal E_{\\text{Theseus}}$的泛性质，是当我们提到忒修斯之船时的“本质”。\n\n如果我们将物理世界作为$\\mathfrak P$，我们可以定义物质意义上的$\\mathcal E$。此时$\\mathcal E$当中的全部对象即是任意忒修斯之船的部分（例如说甲板，和甲板上的这一块和那一块木板，和船舵）。注意到，此时空总是$\\mathcal E$中的对象，也是他的子范畴中的对象。我们不妨将包含关系当作$\\mathcal E$上的态射（他作为对象是什么？），那么此时，_忒修斯之船_（我在这里使用了简记，用*忒修斯之船*以指代$\\mathcal E_{\\text{Theseus}}$）的范性质有两种：始对象即是完整的忒修斯之船（包含了任何一个对象）、终对象即是空（被任何对象所包含）。因此，在如此选定的$\\mathfrak P$上，我们必然会出现忒修斯悖论：\n\n> 如果忒修斯的船上的木头逐渐被替换，直到所有的木头都不是原来的木头，那这艘船还是原来的那艘船吗？\n\n并且我们会得到忒修斯之船的本质即是无这样的谬论——因为无确实是*忒修斯之船*的范性质。这一悖论的原因即是我们对$\\mathfrak P$的错误选取——$\\mathfrak P$应当被选择为现象而非物理世界，因为*忒修斯之船*之形而上并不存在于物理世界，而存在于我们的脑海之中。\n\n同样的，我们注意到，当我们选取$\\mathfrak P$为现象时，$\\mathcal E$上的态射不应单独的选择为包含关系。例如说，当我们追问我是谁的时候，我们常常把自己的特征去掉（如果我不会弹钢琴了，我还是我么？），直至最后得到了“空”这样的答案。倘若以范性质以描述我，“我”是那个感受，那个当你提到任何有关我的方面时，都会让我联想到的那个感受，这个感受即是我。\n\n练习：试分析秃头悖论：当一个人少了多少根头发，我们会认为他秃了？\n\n#### 例子：什么是人？\n\n另外一个例子是“什么是人”。“人”即是当你看到所有你认为是人的时候所想到的，感受到的那个感觉，那个感觉就告诉了你什么是“人”。\n\n但是我们常常还会想要一些更多关于我们认为什么是“人”的信息。那么我们自然可以探索，在以这个感觉作为范性质（形而上）的子范畴中，那些元阶介于这一感觉和看到具体的人之间的那些感受和东西，例如说，有什么样的手、有什么样的脸、有什么样的社会性，等等。\n\n要注意到，这一回答不是本体论的回答，而是实践上的回答：这就是我们在描述我们所认为的“什么是人”的时候唯一能做的事情，正如当小孩问他们的父母，“什么是人？”时，他的父母唯一能做的一样。\n\n#### 例子：对象化（Objectification）\n\n当工人创造其工作成果时，这一行为有时会用对象化一词来形容。有的时候，工人的劳动成果被看作是工人的“我”的一部分。在这个时候，所谓“我的一部分”，其意义在于生产成果是工人认识自身的一种途径：人在劳动成果中“认出自己”，由此，成果不仅属于人，而且是人的延伸，构成人的“现实的我”。\n\n我们在这里提出一种新的，类似的对象化。回想，按照我们的定义：\n\n> “我”是那个感受，那个当你提到任何有关我的方面时，都会让我联想到的那个感受，这个感受即是我。\n\n当工人看到自己的产品时，会感受到这个东西其中自己倾注其中的具体工作和努力，由此会体验和联想到“我”的感受。正如当我们想到我们的身体时，激活了“我”的感受一样，这个产品也成为了“我”的一部分，加入了以“我”作为范性质（形而上）的子范畴中。\n\n### 元阶？\n\n我们注意到，$\\mathcal E$是$\\mathfrak p$上的结构，即是说，$\\mathcal E$是描述性的，是一种对$\\mathfrak p$的理解，而非构造性的，一种对$\\mathfrak p$的定义。也就是说，我们所面对的$\\mathcal E$（几乎）是不区分元阶的。请看如下例子：\n\n#### 例子：龙血\n\n>生活在魔法之都的约翰出生于炼金世家，从小他就对各种炼金原料了如指掌：例如说人血和龙血。在他的眼中，人血就是人的血、而龙血就是龙的血。他们都是血，只是从不同的生物身上得道而已。\n\n我们可以说，人、龙、血对于约翰都是同一元阶的，倘若我们将人、龙、血，作为基石，那么显然，人、龙、血都是1元阶对象；而人血和龙血则都是2元阶对象。\n\n>在遥远的北方，有着一座被巨龙统治的小镇。卢克打小就生活在此，在他的印象中，龙是不可战胜，无可损伤的，然而在龙的压迫下，镇民的生活一日不如一日，反抗的低语此起彼伏，但是却没有人胆敢攻击那无可战胜的龙。然而，卢克有一日却忽然意识到——他从未见过龙受过伤……但是龙血应该也是存在的吧？就和人血一样？ （to do：not a good example）\n\n我们可以说，人血、龙对于卢克都是同1元阶的，倘若我们将人血、龙作为基石，那么显然，人血、龙都是1元阶对象；而根据人血和龙而联想到的龙血，则是2元阶对象。\n\n> 在过了许久之后，卢克和镇民们已经成功反抗的龙的统治，用一把黑剑刺入了龙的心脏。在卢克的晚年，龙血对于他而言已经没有什么特别的了。龙血只是龙的血而已，正如人血只是人的血而已，龙和人一样，都只是会受伤的生物罢了。\n\n我们可以说，此时，人、龙、血对于卢克都是同一元阶的，倘若我们将人、龙、血，作为基石，那么显然，人、龙、血都是1元阶对象；而人血和龙血则都是2元阶对象。\n\n----\n\n为什么会产生这种无法区分元阶的情况呢？其原因在于元阶的定义依赖于第一章所介绍的构造方法，$\\mathcal T_n$总是由$\\mathcal T_{n-1}$所*生成*的，给定某种构造，我们才可以定义元阶——或者说，当我们给对象指定元阶时，我们就确定了一组特定的构造方法。但是$\\mathcal E$本身并不是被构造出来的，**$\\mathcal E$是$\\mathfrak p$上的结构**，而不是$\\mathfrak p$是$\\mathcal E$的结果。\n\n我们并不能够直接说*笔*的概念生成了*铅笔*，因为我们可能先知道了铅笔，然后将许多笔抽象，得到了笔的概念，我们也不能够直接说*铅笔*的概念生成了*笔*，因为可能我之前见过许多笔，有了笔的概念，但是却没有见到过铅笔，于是用*笔*的概念想到了一种特别的用石墨做芯的笔（也就是铅笔）。\n\n###  构造（Construction）和形而上学\n\n那么我们为什么要关心元阶呢？因为形而上学：\n\n> 一个$\\mathcal E_m = \\mathcal M$上的构造$\\{\\mathcal T_n^m\\}=\\{\\mathcal T_n\\}^m$(右上角角标$m$用以标记其结果$\\mathcal T_\\infty^m = \\mathcal T^m=\\mathcal M$ )是指的：给定一个组基石$\\{m_i\\}\\subseteq \\text{Obj}_\\mathcal M$ ，并以该基石作为0元阶段范畴$\\mathcal O$，以某种特定方式构造的塔式结构，并且其所产生的结果$\\mathcal T_\\infty=\\mathcal T^m$等于$\\mathcal M$。\n\n> 一个$\\mathcal M$上的形而上学（metaphysics），或者说，一个“第三类（种）形而上”（Metaphysics object of the third kind），是一个$\\mathcal M$上的构造。\n\n也就是说，一个形而上学就是一种构造。我们可以通过给每一个对象指定塔式构造的层数来指定这一构造：\n\n> $\\{\\mathcal T_n\\}^m$的元阶组是一组多元组（Tuple）：$\\{(a,i)|a\\in \\text{Obj}_\\mathcal M,\\ i = \\text{MetaOrder}_{\\{\\mathcal T_n\\}^m}(a)\\}$ ；\n> 一个$\\mathcal M$上的元阶组是一组多元组$\\{(a,i)|a\\in \\text{Obj}_\\mathcal M,\\ i \\in \\mathbb Z^+\\}$。\n> \n> 给定一个$\\mathcal M$上的元阶组，我们也给定了一个构造组：一组构造，且该组中的每一个构造的元阶组都相同且等于该给定的$\\mathcal M$上的元阶组。\n\n#### 例子：道德仁义礼1\n\n按照《后形而上学 其一》中，道德仁义礼的例子，我们可以给定一个（简化的）元阶组：\n\n>{（道，0），（德，1），（仁，1），（义，2），（礼，3）}\n>\n>道是基石（也是始对象），道生成诸德（例如人德、狗德等），其中人德即是仁（也可以认为仁是人德的一种，那么从仁开始后续的元阶都要+1），仁生成了诸多义（如兄弟之义、子女之义），不同的义再生成礼（如吃饭时如何对待父母的礼）。\n\n即是按照生成的顺序，以道这一对象作为基石，生成了所有的事物。其中道是整个$\\mathcal E_\\text{Tao}$的始对象。\n\n我们将这种基石和整个范畴的泛性质相等的结构称之为自上而下（Top-dowm）。\n\n#### 例子：道德仁义礼2\n\n按照《后形而上学 其一》中，道德仁义礼的例子，我们可以给定一个（简化的）元阶组：\n\n>{（道，5），（德，4），（仁，3），（义，2），（礼，1）}\n>\n> 我们见到了人们之间相互交流的模式（现象礼），并从中总结出了一种范式（义）。我们认为这种范式是一种人的运作的规律（仁），自然的想到所有的东西都有他的某种运作的规律（德），最终想到这些所有事物的运作规律背后，可能有一个东西决定了这些所有的运作规律（道）。\n\n即是按照抽象的顺序，以我们看到的一些现象（比如礼）这一对象作为基石，生成了所有的事物（抽象概念）。其中道是整个$\\mathcal E_\\text{Tao}$的终对象。\n\n我们将这种基石和整个范畴的泛性质，其一元阶为1，另一元阶为$\\infty$或该范畴内的最高元阶的结构称之为自上下而上（Bottoom-up）。\n\n##

中，应该存在某种稳定结构（不知道是什么结构）被保持在每一个$\\mathbb{E}_{t_i}$中，我们暂把其写作$S_E$，并且这个结构具有某种不变性。也就是说，这种不变性在 $T$ 中以某种方式是可以被识别出来的，因为$T$保持他。虽然我们可能很难找到它。\n    57→\n    58→倘若包含在上述演化中的某一个时刻$t_c$所对应的$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$是所有$\\mathbb E_{t}$当中拥有对象最少的（或许这是人一生中的某一个极早时刻），那么这意味着这一稳定结构至多即是某个$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$中的稳定结构，我们把在这种选择下的稳定结构写作$S_{E_c}$。如果你认为这一时刻是某种$\\mathbb E_t$首次出现的时刻，因此有可能独立于经验与感官印象，则你可以将这种稳定结构当中的这一部分认定为“先天”。进一步的，如果你认为$\\mathbb{E}$表示了某种认知，那么假如能够证明这一稳定结构当中的一部分一旦缺失，则无法从$\\mathfrak P_t$中构建任何$\\mathbb{E}_{t}$，则可以将这部分稳定结构称之为“认知结构”。由此，这意味着，在一些哲学框架下，这一稳定结构当中的一部分即有可能是“先天认知结构”[^1]。倘若我们更加平凡的选取$t_a$和$t_b$，不要求演化中包含这样特定的$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$，我们则可以寻找到到更大的和不同的$S_E$，其中则可能除了$S_{E_c}$之外还有其他的（但可能与之相关的）稳定结构，在一些哲学框架下，这些稳定结构可以被认为是后天构建的认知框架。\n    59→\n    60→进一步，在 $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$ 的演化中也应该存在某种稳定结构，这种结构就是我们平时所说的“限定语法规则”之类的东西。\n    61→\n    62→我们已经知道，直接研究 $\\mathbb{E}_t$ 以及 $T_t$ 的演化是困难的。但是我们已经有了函子：\n    63→$$\n    64→(F_{E,L})_t: (\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\to \\mathbb{E}_t\n    65→$$\n    66→这样，我们就可以设想存在某种稳定结构 $S_L$ 在 $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$ 中稳定出现，同时存在某种结构 $S_E$ 在 $\\mathbb{E}_t$ 中保持稳定。通过 $(F_{E,L})_t$（或者某种其他的$(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\to \\mathbb{E}_t$的函子，例如针对某句特定的话内省，当我们看到一句话时其导致我们内心的反应），我们就有可能可以建立一个结构之间的映射关系去至少部分的获取有关 $S_E$ 的信息：\n    67→$$\n    68→(F_{E,L})_t(S_L) \\approx S_E\n    69→$$\n    70→于是我们就可以通过语言游戏研究语言演化中的稳定结构 $S_L$，来间接获得对 $\\mathbb{E}_t$ 中 $S_E$ 的认识，也就是明晰他在感受的范畴之中和其他感受的联系。我们的核心假设是$(F_{E,L})_t(S_L)$和$S_E$至少有一部分重叠。\n    71→\n    72→虽然在这里我们以语言游戏为例，在更好的情况下，我们可以对数个不同的境，例如 $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$ 和 $(\\mathcal{E}_M)_t$等等进行这样的操作，那么通过他们的集合$\\{(F_{E,i})_t(S_i)\\}_i$，我们将能够或许有机会进一步接近$S_E$。事实上，如果我有两个能够以某种形式化的方法（在这里我们的选择是范畴论）去描述的境$(\\mathcal{E}_A)_t$和$(\\mathcal{E}_B)_t$，并且我能够将其中的对象在两个境内进行转换，也就是存在某种$(F_{A \\to B})_t$或者$(F_{B \\to A})_t$，那么，我们之后将会论证，这样的$(F_{A \\to B})_t$必然需要途径$\\mathbb E_t$而捕捉到一部分$\\mathbb E_t$当中到稳定结构。也就是$\\mathbb E_t$中必然存在某些“可被多种形式系统共同描述”的结构，因而这部分稳定结构必然可以用某种形式化的方法（在这里是范畴论）描述。\n    73→\n    74→除了针对$S_E$，我们也可以对其他的存在于$\\mathbb E_t$中的某些结构做类似的研究。这也同时给出了为什么语言游戏作为哲学治疗是有效的，并且将其扩展到其他非语言的境中。\n    75→\n    76→注意到，这里的稳定结构仅仅是描述性的，并且在一些场景下可能具有一定的实用性，但他是否具有某种形而上意义，是否到来某种价值论，例如是否应当追求他，在此我们并未得出结论。\n    77→\n    78→## K1策略：知识的发生\n    79→\n    80→本章节的目的，在于描述语言本身的结构，如何逼迫知识结构的形成。也就是说，某些语言形式似乎强制性地要求我们建立某种特定的“信念–证实”网络， 语言不是只是表达已知知识，而是一种知识验证框架，甚至反向促成了知识结构的构建。一些语句试图“拉出”一组态射，或者指出其断裂：语言行为（如对话、辩护、叙事）要求我们给出论证关系，于是我们开始构造知识结构本身。\n    81→\n    82→接下来考虑$(\\mathcal E_K)_t$，即某一时刻的知识结构。一个形象的理解是其中的对象为信念，射态为证实关系（注意证实关系是一种信念，即是我们认可什么样的论证方式）。我们可以类似$(\\mathcal E_ L)_t$的构造相关的射态和$\\mathcal E_L$。尤为重要的是，存在某种函子\n    83→$$\n    84→(F_{L \\to K})_t: (\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\to (\\mathcal{E}_K)_t\n    85→$$\n    86→即是某一些语句，可以对应某一存在于知识网络中的信念。因为这两个范畴都存在于$\\mathbb E_t$中，因此函子本身作为高阶射态也可以存在于$\\mathbb E_t$中（因为境是塔式结构）。幸运的是，这一函子对于许多人来说恰好确实存在。我们可以通过自省来验证该函子的存在：当我们阅读某句话时，是否能够感受到思想内关于这句话所描述信念的存在，并且确认这一信念在知识网络中的位置：他会令自己联想到哪些其他的信念。\n    87→\n    88→接下来，我们考虑如下过程，通过玩语言游戏，我们构造了在$(\\mathcal{E}_L)_{t}$中的新语句$a$。我们马上可以自省以使用$(F_{L \\to K})_t$将该语句映射为一信念，并在接下来的时刻（$t'$之前）尝试构建知识网络。我们注意到，类似于$(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$，$(\\mathcal E_K)_t$有其内部的某种稳定结构$S_L$，这一稳定结构可以由$(\\mathcal E_K)_t$的演化中识别。而“将该语句映射为一信念并尝试构建知识网络”就是知识范畴的演化过程。根据是否能保持这一特定的稳定结构，$a$所对应的信念将被接受或者拒绝，两种情况都将导致$(\\mathcal E_K)_t$演化为$(\\mathcal E_K)_{t'}$，并且他可能等同或者不等同于$(\\mathcal E_K)_t$（也就是说，即便拒绝，演化后的知识网络不包含$a$所对应的信念，这一演化过程也可能对知识网络产生扰动）。当$a$对应的信念成为$(\\mathcal E_K)_{t'}$的对象时，知识就发生了。\n    89→\n    90→在这一过程中，有两个地方有可能会使用到$\\mathbb{E}_t$中的稳定结构$S_E$。首先，函子$(F_{L \\to K})_t$有可能是通过函子$(F_{E,L})_t$和$(F_{E,K})_t$构建的，例如：\n    91→$$\n    92→(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,L})_t} \\mathbb{E}_t \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,K})_t^{-1}} (\\mathcal{E}_K)_t\n    93→$$\n    94→由此在$(F_{L \\to K})_t$的过程中，由于上一章节的原因，使用（途经/穿过）了$\\mathbb{E}_t$中的$S_E$。或者，函子$(F_{L \\to K})_t$需要通过$\\mathbb{E}_{t}$的演化来生成新的信念感受$a$，然后尝试将其加入知识网络，也就是说，我们可以把$(F_{L \\to K})_t$定义为\n    95→$$\n    96→(F_{L \\to K})_t=(F_{E,K})_{t+1}^{-1} \\circ T_t \\circ (F_{E,L})_t\n    97→$$\n    98→这里使用$\\circ$表示函子的组合以防止歧义。用另一种表达方式，我们可以说：\n    99→$$\n   100→(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,L})_t} \\mathbb{E}_{t+1} \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,K})_{t+1}^{-1}} (\\mathcal{E}_K)_{t+2}\n   101→$$\n   102→此时应当将$(F_{L \\to K})_t$认为是某种特定的开始于时刻$t$的内省过程，并且此处$(F_{E,L})_t$是$T_t$的限制（restriction，可以理解为“子函子”：$(F_{E,L})_t=T_t|_{(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t}$）。不论采用哪种记号，都在$(F_{L \\to K})_t$中都有演化过程，其中可以识别出$S_E$。其次，$(\\mathcal E_K)_t$的演化，遵照上一章节的描述，其内部的特定稳定结构应当可以构成同$S_E$的函子。\n   103→\n   104→最后，这意味着我们可以通过玩语言游戏明晰$S_K$。\n   105→\n   106→## 策略K1：自然变换\n   107→\n   108→我们接下里考虑观察到的他人、语言、数学等对感受到影响。接下来，我将先用数学语言进行描述，然后根据在K1形式中的定义进行解释。我们以数学为例，考虑以下两条路径从 $(\\mathcal{E}_M)_t$ 到 $\\mathbb{E}_{t+1}$：\n   109→\n   110→1.  \n   111→$$\n   112→(\\mathcal{E}_M)_t

右边（codomain）描述\"1+1\"遵照数学规律演化为\"1+1=2\"，我们看到了\"1+1=2\"后的体验\n   146→\n   147→也就是说，$\\eta_a$ 是一种在体验中，我们看到 “1+1” 后对其进行思考后所产生的那种感受，与我们看到 “1+1=2” 时所感到的那种感受之间的链接感受。它就像是我们做完一道数学题后，对照参考答案时所经历的那种“确认过程”的体验。我们可以将 $\\eta_a$ 理解为：通过数学结构对思考进行确认的过程，其对应的感受。\n   148→\n   149→特殊地，当 $\\eta_a$ 是单位元时，意味着我们对 “1+1” 的思考结果所带来的感受，与我们直接看到 “1+1=2” 时的感受完全一致，不需要经过任何额外思考来完成确认。就像是我们对照答案时，一眼就意识到自己的解答与参考答案完全一致，不需要任何过程就直接意识到自己脑海当中的推导是对的的那种感觉。是那种无需中介、直接闭合的“直接确认感”。我们可以将这种情况称之为对$a$对掌握。\n   150→\n   151→\n   152→接下来，我们理解自然性条件。\n   153→$$\n

161→为了获得更加直觉的理解，让我们使用两个常见的特例来理解这一公式。首先取$f$为某个固定的可逆的（充分必要的）推导关系，也就是说他在函子$T_M$的演化下不变（即我们不使用数学规律把他变为另一种形式）。此时关于这样的$f$的自然性条件可以化简为\n   162→$$\n   163→\\eta_a = \\hat{f}^{-1}_{t+1} \\circ  \\eta_{a'} \\circ T(\\hat{f}_t) \n   164→$$\n   165→其中 $\\hat{f}_t = (F_{E,M})_t(f)$（即 $f$ 在 $\\mathbb{E}_t$ 中的嵌入），以及 $\\hat{f}_{t+1} = (F_{E,M})_{t+1}(f)$（即 $f$ 在 $\\mathbb{E}_{t+1}$ 中的嵌入）。\n   166→\n   167→如果$T(\\hat

171→此时可以证明$\\eta_a$和$\\eta_{a'}$都必须为单位元。这意味着，如果$a$和$a'$在数学上可以通过某种数学关系相互推导（$f:a\\rightarrow a'$且$f$可逆），并且你能稳定的在脑海中重现这种推导过程（$T(\\hat f_t)=\\hat f_{t+1}$）。那么如果你已经掌握了$a'$，则掌握$a$（即获得对$a$的直接确认感）就需要是\n   172→1. 你把$a$按照你脑海当中的推导过程$f$推导为$a'$，\n   173→2. 无需过程就意识到$a'$是对的，\n   174→3. 然后由$a'$重新推出$a$的过程。\n   175→\n   176→如果我无法通过这一过程获取对$a$的直接确认感，则自然性条件不满足。注意到，最后一步由$a'$重新推出$a$的过程是必要的。因为我们可能会偶然地从不理解的结构推出一个简单结果，但却无法从该结果返回推理出原结构的合理性。在这种情况下，我们并不会感觉我们真正“掌握”了 $a$，因为我们无法从已知结构自然地产生出对它的确认体验。\n   177→\n   178→接下来，如果$f$为某个固定的不可逆的（即充分但不必要的）推导关系，此时自然性条件为\n   179→$$\n   180→\\hat{f}_{t+1} \\circ \\eta_a = \\eta_{a'} \\circ T(\\hat{f}_t)\n   181→$$\n   182→注意此时$\\eta_a$和$\\eta_{a'}$不一定是单位元。如果$T(\\hat

在等式左边描述成功数学确认$a$后，能够在脑海内使用推到过程从$a$推出$a'$\n   188→- 在等式右边能够在脑海内使用推导过程从$a$推出$a'$后成功对$a'$使用数学进行确认，\n   189→\n   190→我们打一个生活中的比方，想象一个游戏，游戏只有两个选项，选择一项为正确，另一项为错误。如果$a$为游戏攻略中的指南，而$a'$为具体在游戏中的正确操作。如果我能稳定的从指南中描述的游戏玩法推断出具体操作，则\n   191→- 我在玩游戏前游戏攻略确认了玩法，然后在玩的时候从玩法规则在脑内正确的推演了我现在具体要怎么操作\n   192→- 我没有看看游戏攻略确认玩法，直接用印象中的玩法在脑内推演我现在的操作，然后我通过游戏的结果进行确认我的操作\n   193→这两个不同路径能够稳定地达到同样的效果，即是我正确操作并通过了游戏。如果我记错了游戏玩法，那么前者能够通过游戏，而后者则不能；如果游戏在发布攻略后修改了游戏玩法，则前者不能通过游戏，而后者则有可能通过。也就是说，自然性条件可以理解为要求某个范畴的演化和内部感受的演化的一致性：即是说，自然性要求“你以为这个游戏怎么玩”和“这个游戏实际上怎么玩”这两者之间相互契合，这一契合通过对操作结果（作为现象）的确认是否成立，即是否存在$\\eta$，达成。\n   194→\n   195→最后，当$f$在$T_M$下有变换时，类似上面的描述，可以理解为这一变换必须要和我们在脑海中设想的他的变换兼容。\n   196→\n   197→当我们把这一框架使用在语言上，我们可以得到一个经典问题的描述性解答：对于语言来说，是结构先于意义，还是意义先于结构？如果我们认为句子的意义是某一段语言所引发的心理过程，那么我们现在知道，结构和意义之间的关系是自然变换：一句话能够被理解，他必须能够在心理过程的演化和结构的演化中达成如上所述的这种一致性感受$\\eta$，一种对齐。\n   198→- 从语言的角度来说，也就是说如果我们只能改变一个句子的句法结构，那么这个句子要被理解，他必须要“回应”某种给定的心理过程；\n   199→- 从心理的角度来说，也就是说如果我们只能尝试改变自身的心理状态，那么要能读懂一个给定的句子，我们也必须要改变我们的心理状态去“回应”这个句子的结构。\n   200→\n   201→进一步的，我们现在可以做出如下猜测：当你看到一个东西，并且认为你懂这个东西，这意味着这个东西的结构演化与你自身的经验演化之间确立了一个自然变换。形象的说，当你看到“猫跳上了桌子”这句话。这句话在语言中的构造有着固定的演化结构（例如遵照主谓宾的构造方法），而你在逐字阅读这句话的过程（也就是句子演化逐步展开），你在你的脑海中也模拟了这个动作，在脑中看到猫移动、跃起、落到桌上。当这两个演化结构对齐时，你就感到你理解了这句话，而你脑海中的这个过程就被认为是这句话所表达的意义。而当我们无法构建这种自然变换时，例如，当你看到“你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国，记住我给出的原理”，而无法在脑海完成某个对应的的心理过程以同这句话对齐时，你就无法获得“我懂了”的这个感受。\n   202→\n   203→另一方面，如果你通过网络搜索理解了这句话的发生场景，作为meme的意义，当你再次阅读这句话时，虽然你无法从语法的角度理解他，但是你却能够从网络文化的角度获得“我懂了”的感受。这是因为在文化的范畴上这句话的展开（例如他的使用背景、传播方式、引用逻辑）能够以某种对齐的方式在你的心理过程中展开，由此构建了某种代表一致性的感受$\\eta$。\n   204→\n   205→也就是说，“我懂了”并不是对某句话本身的“本体性确认”，而是对$\\eta$所代表的一致性的那种“体验确认”。当我看到一个东西，我是否理解他，取决于这个东西在我的经验结构中是否能被嵌入到某个已理解的结构系统中，并与这个东西的演化之间获得$\\eta$的感受以建立自然变换。\n   206→\n   207→进一步的说，当我们“感受”到他人的感受、明细了某个现象的“意义”时，例如说，当我意识到，这对情侣是真的相爱的时，我感受到的并不是某种实体性的“爱”，而是当我看到这对情侣的互动后，这些现象和我脑海中的经验与模式“共振”，并帮助我最终抵达、或者创造了我的脑海中那个关于“爱”的感受。\n   208→\n   209→## KA猜想：某种稳定结构\n   210→\n   211→最后，让我们考虑$\\mathbb E_t$的子范畴中的稳定结构。\n   212→\n   213→考虑某一个$\\mathbb E_t$中的子范畴$(\\mathcal E_i)_t$，这一子范畴在演化下将保有某种稳定结构$S_i$，如同先前所叙述的。我们现在假设这一稳定结构是某种子范畴，即$S_i$是$\\{(\\mathcal E_i)_{t_j}\\}_j$中每个范畴的子范畴。数学上我们有许多手段去寻找$S_i$，例如寻找不变子范畴，要求$T$或者$T_i$在$S_i$上的作用是恒等或自然等价。在这里我们使用极限（limit）或余极限（colimit）做尝试。\n   214→\n   215→> Todo: KA猜想\n   216→> 这一章节的核心意图是论证在某些假设下，可以推导出《范畴论与境》A1策略中给出的形而上概念作为范性质的定义，（注意到，K1策略并没有使用塔式构造，也没有使用形而上作为范性质的定义。）。也就是说，形而上概念之所以形成，是因为他形成了体验中的某些稳定结构，并且这些稳定结构作为子范畴当中具有某一种范性质，而这一范性质就是我们所以为的那种“本质”，一种“实体”的感觉。进一步的，在这样明晰了形而上的具体结构后，我们可以论证为什么有的体验能够被形而上，而有一些则不行或者较为困难，也就是到底哪些是有效的子范畴（例如我们如何和为什么能从$\\mathbb E$中构造$\\mathcal E_L$）。我们这里可以用笔作为例子，描述我们见到的笔的现象如何聚合为一种“笔”的“物理实体”，然后再如何由诸多的具体的“笔”构成理想的“笔”的概念。进一步的，在最好的情况下，可以通过哲学实验去经验性的验证起点的假设。同样的，这也可以用于明晰概念如何通过境的演化而产生，迁移，和整合。\n   217→> \n   218→> 这或许也是寻找$S_E$的一种方法，当子范畴被选定为整个$\\mathbb E_t$：极限的泛性质是说：对于任何其他范畴X，如果X也有到这个演化链中每个范畴的函子，并且这些函子与演化函子$T_t$相容，那么存在唯一的函子从X到极限范畴。\n   219→> \n   220→> 最后，还可以寻找一种定义方法定义“张力”。张力是指的某种无法确定唯一终对象的状态。这一察觉来源于语言的使用当中，存在一些逻辑和结构使得一句话“说完了”，不论是在文法上还是在表达上。例如说，当论证完成，逻辑达成闭环时，就意味着论证的终止；当我们诉说完对一个事情的抱怨，不再有任何更多的抱怨以抱怨时，就意味着某些话说完了。与之对应的是一种“完满的感觉”。也就是说，存在一种东西，这个东西是所有语言中的子范畴的终对象的对象。我们可以使用内省作为函子回到$\\mathbb E_t$，于是这意味着当一个形而上指向这一终对象时，我们就感到这一形而上完满、一致和结束，我们把这种感受写作$T$。也就是说，如果有一些感受无法被联想到一个范性质时，例如有多个潜在的范性质可能，但是没有完全满足范性质的条件，我们就无法取得$T$。就像是我们被几个不同的逻辑或者价值观卡住而无法做出决定一样（比如说“救对象还是救爸妈”）。\n   221→> \n   222→> 因为语言的范畴的演化是不断说完话的过程，那么感受的演化也就至少一部分是不断“企图获取”$T$的过程。也就是说，如果我们用“目的”这一框架来描述这一过程，那么在这种意味上，我们为什么要不断、继续的讨论哲学，正是因为在一些哲学的领域我们无法找到或者构建一个范性质以获取$T$。这也是哲学治疗为什么有效的原因。\n   223→> \n   224→> 从另一个角度来讲，小孩子的$\\mathfrak P_t$通常比成年人的要小，因此小孩通常容易在$\\mathbb E_t$中获取和构建连接到$T$的感受，因而小孩更容易取得完满的感受。当小孩长大，$\\mathbb E_t$中的内容越来越多，射态越来越复杂，就有可能有更少比例的感受指向$T$，因而较难取得完满的感受，也就是也就是张力。如果在成长过程中，他能够理清思绪或者寻找到某中框架使得大部分感受指向$T$，那么他就又获得了取回$T$的能力，甚至能够主动的整理和构建自己的感受以主动的获取$T$。\n   225→> \n   226→> 注意到，我们在这里依旧是描述性的。人是否应当不断的获取$T$，抑或是人应当怎么看待$T$，$T$是否意味着某种人的意义，未获取$T$的状态是否具有价值，是否我们应该去避免获取$T$，我们在这里并未做出像这样本体论或者价值论的判断。\n   227→> \n   228→> 关于$T$我还有另一点猜想，那就是$T$可能来源于人对边界的识别，也就是说，在《后形而上学》当中，人所具有的那种分与和的能力，能够把视觉信息中把近似的红色的东西归于一块，认为这是一个东西，和周围的东西不是同一个东西的那个能力。在生理上，可以认为这个能力部分来源于人感官的不精确性（合），在思想上，可以认为这个能力来源于人归纳抽象的能力。也就是说，追求$T$的过程，可以理解为对恒常性的追求。\n   229→> \n   230→> 这也回答了美诺悖论：如果我不知道要学什么，那我怎么学？如果我知道了，为什么还要学？现在我们知道，如果我们无法取得$\\eta$感受，那么我们就会觉得我不完全理解一件事情。这可能是网络中存在空洞导致路径缺失，或者是因为网络存在张力：也就是说我们无法组织网络以获得范性质。那么这时我们就知道了“我不知道”在这个结构中可能存在的某个东西或者某个统一的构造有效子范畴的方式。这就是“我要学的那个东西”，但是她不是我已经学会的东西。当通过整理射态，这一网络中形成了某个泛性质、或者当我们取得新的概念补完路径，获取了$\\eta$，那么我们就觉得我们学会了我们之前想学的那个东西。\n

E$中的对象或者射态（例如前叙的$\\eta_a$），则它是一种体验。并且我们有可能有机会能够通过内省去获得他。进一步的，我们能够通过构建恰当符合结构的例子去唤醒读者的某一种特定的体验。一旦这一例子得以可重复的在不同读者中确立，那么我们等同于进行了一场“哲学实验”，并得以在实践中对相关的哲学论断进行一定程度的验证。需要强调，我们不需要本体论的验证不同的人获得了“同一”体验（例如Qualia），只需要他们他们具有相同的结构性位置。\n   246→4. 更进一步的，如果我们将这种方法应用于不同的人群，我们或许可以获取跨人群、时间、文化的体验差异和共性。例如，倘若有某一体验能够在成年人中被稳定的唤醒，而在儿童中却较为困难，这或许揭示了某种认知结构的发展机制。倘若有某一体验能够在有神论者中被稳定唤醒，而在无神论者中却较为困难，（或者我们无法找到具有显著性的像这样例子），这或许揭示了宗教体验和理解如何构建认知结构。也就是说，部分哲学问题可以被重新表达为“哪些结构在什么人群中可被诱发”，以及“为什么有些结构在某些人群中无法形成”。哲学结构如果在经验中有稳定呈现，就可以通过实践的心理手段作为验证机制进行经验性验证[^2]。在最好的情况下，某一哲学论断对应的范畴论命题可以由在$\\mathbb E$中的某些对象和射态的存在性推出，并且可以通过设计实验，验证这些感受可以通过符合特定结构的思想实验、文学、音乐、画面、影像、互动游戏等方式进行稳定的唤醒，并且被唤醒的体验处于预计的结构上的位置，由此获得这一哲学论断的经验性验证。\n   247→\n   248→最后，我想要强调，本文所得出的结论是描述性的。例如说，我只是描述性的指出可能存在形如$S_{E_c}$这样的稳定结构和其所处的结构性位置，但是他的本体论地位，是否等同于许多哲学框架中的“先天认知结构”，本文并未得出结论。\n   249→\n   250→但是，一旦我们用结构描述出某些认知结构与经验形态，我们就获得了与之相关的那些引导体验、激发理解、构造认知路径的能力。我们不仅仅可以在实践中对他们进行验证和使用，我们还可以利用他们进行推演和衍生，并在实践中确立新的感受和构建新的结构。\n   251→\n   252→## 写在最后\n   253→\n   254→我想要在最后对在方法论中作为“哲学实验”的核心过程做出一些解释：通过构造特定的结构以唤起相应的体验，以此来查明这一体验所处的结构性位置，并最终将这一结论实践和延展，并以此稳定的唤醒和构造体验。这一过程并不仅仅局限于在本文的框架中使用范畴论来描述结构。事实上，诗歌、文学、艺术、音乐、建筑、游戏、烹饪、旅游、meme等等活动都在不断的进行这一过程，使用各自不同的“语言”以描述结构，只是我们在这里使用了范畴论作为这一工具，一个脚手架，但“哲学实验”的实践是广泛的，并且我们可以观察到他广泛的存在于基本的人类活动之中，我们不断的进行境的构建、体验和演化。一个基本的例子：母亲哄孩子睡觉需要设计声音和节奏的结构以构建某种境来唤醒睡意。也就是说，从某种意义上来说，“You have already made the choice. You are here to try to understand why and how you made it”，我们常常已经选择和构建了产生特定感受和体验的境，我们只是有时候不知道为什么（例如忘记了境是何时或怎么被构建的）我们会最终得到这一体验。如果想要明晰我们对生活、自身、和周遭的困惑，我们可以有察觉的注意到这一点，并尝试理解其内部过程，理清这一切是如何发生。我在这里使用的范畴论仅仅是工具的一种，我们已经有许多现成的工具可以帮助我们达成这一点，并且各有所长。\n   255→\n   256→最后，不论读者是否阅读过，我都邀请读者带着对境的理解再次重新阅读我在2022年写的《[[形而上学后的目的：诗意]]》。这篇文章即是“境”的概念被我第一次提出的时候。\n   257→\n   258→## 一些额外猜想\n   259→\n   260→基于本文的猜想，这意味着，如果我们能够给定一组$S_E$和与其兼容的现象集$\\mathfrak P$，那么我们就可以以他为约束生成$\\mathbb E_t$和其演化。即是任何加入$\\mathbb E_t$的对象和射态所导致的$\\mathbb E_t$的演化都必须保证$S_E$的稳定存在，同$S_E$兼容。这意味着，根据$S_E$的不同，我们可以或许可以构造出，至少是现象上来说，具有认知结构的不同实体。一个可能的候选是以某种Homotopy Type Theory的框架作为$S_E$。\n   261→\n   262→[^1]: 注意到，这里有一个问题，那就是$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$时就已经有$\\mathfrak P_{t_c}$，我们不知道$\\mathfrak P$是否在$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$之前就已经存在。进一步的，因为$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$中已经有现象，因此$S_E$当中也可能有现象。换而言之，我们有几种理解先天认知结构的方法。我们这里列出几种，一种是先天认知结构是一种存在于任何现象之前的东西$\\mathbb E_{0}$，$\\mathbb E_{0}$和$\\mathfrak P_{t_c}$共同决定了$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$；另一种是现象的可能形式是由先天认知结构$\\mathbb E_{0}$所决定的，即$\\mathbb E_{0}$决定了$\\mathfrak P_{t_c}$再产生$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$；还有一种是我们认为先天认知结构就是现象的形式，那么$\\mathfrak P_{t_c}$当中就已经包含了先天认知结构。如此等等。注意到，$\\mathbb E_{0}$不在$\\mathfrak P_{t_c}$之中，而$\\mathfrak P_{t_c}$是我们所能探索的边界，因此我们无法对$\\mathbb E_{0}$进行探查。不论如何理解，这些看法只是对$S_E$对本体论位置进行确认，我们事实上能查明的最小稳定结构就是$S_E$。\n   263→[^2]: 注意到，这是一个关于经验的分析判断：如果一个东西在经验中有稳定呈现，就可以进行经验性验证。\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

范畴论与境：K1策略\n\n在[[范畴论与境]]未完成的草稿中，我们奠定了一套框架。K1策略是使用该框架的一个尝试。\n\n这篇文章是为了记录想法， 于仓促间写就，因而没有为阅读体验做过额外打磨，许多技术性的地方还没有像《范畴论与境》中那样给出贴近生活的例子，阅读节奏也比较凌乱。所以对于过于技术性的部分，如果读者感到困难，可以暂时跳过。\n\n## 函子\n\n由于本篇文章是快速记录，我们略过函子的定义。总而言之，一个从范畴C到D的函子把C中的对象映射到D中的对象，把C中的射态映射到D中的射态。并且保持单位元，而且射态的组合在映射前进行和在映射后进行没有差别。\n\n## K1形式\n\n我们定义演化函子 $T$ 和转换函子 $F$。\n\n$$\nT_t: \\mathbb{E}_t \\to \\mathbb{E}_{t+1}\n$$\n这里的 $\\mathbb{E}$ 是境，$\\mathbb{E}_t$可以理解为在某一个特定的思想状态下那个特定的境，这个 $T$ 是境的演化函子，$t$ 不一定是物理时间，只是某种 label，他可以是物理时间，也可以是某种心理时间或者其他的东西。如果$t$是物理时间，那么$\\mathbb{E}_t$可以理解为在某一个瞬间一个人的境。虽然$t$ 不一定是物理时间，在接下来我将会用“时刻”指代某一特定的$t$。为了简便，$t$在这里我们将其取离散值。\n\n接下来，我们将定义一系列的转换函子，并以其引出数个$\\mathbb{E}_t$的子范畴（境）。\n\n首先，我们可以从$\\mathbb{E}_t$中“抽取”出一些特定的境：\n$$\n(F_{E,L})_t: (\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\to \\mathbb{E}_t\n$$\n这是一个嵌入函子（inclusion），其中 $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$ 是某一时刻主观语言结构的范畴，是 $\\mathbb{E}_t$ 的子范畴。\n\n我们还可以对不同的境做转换：\n$$\n(F_{L \\to M})_t: (\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\to (\\mathcal{E}_M)_t\n$$\n其中 $(\\mathcal{E}_M)_t$ 是主观时刻 $t$ 下的数学结构范畴。\n\n类似地，可以定义：\n$$\n(F_{E,M})_t: (\\mathcal{E}_M)_t \\to \\mathbb{E}_t\n$$\n\n我们还可以定义某种跨演化的境，例如说，我们可以构造一种“通用的”语言范畴：\n$$\n(F_{L})_t: (\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\to \\mathcal{E}_L\n$$\n其中 $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$ 是语言范畴 $\\mathcal{E}_L$ 的子范畴。数学部分类似地有：\n$$\n(F_{M})_t: (\\mathcal{E}_M)_t \\to \\mathcal{E}_M\n$$\n\n注意到，本节中的定义仅仅是一种描述（建模）的尝试，也仅仅只是一种选择。例如说，或许相较与离散的实践变换，一种更连续的变换在一些方面会更有优势。\n\n## K1策略：$\\mathbb E_t$的某种稳定结构\n\n接下来，我们做出一个猜想：在 $T$ 函子的演化中，例如从演化 $\\mathbb{E}_{t_a}\\to\\mathbb{E}_{t_a+1}\\to\\cdots\\mathbb{E}_{t_b-1}\\to\\mathbb{E}_{t_b}$ 中，应该存在某种稳定结构（不知道是什么结构）被保持在每一个$\\mathbb{E}_{t_i}$中，我们暂把其写作$S_E$，并且这个结构具有某种不变性。也就是说，这种不变性在 $T$ 中以某种方式是可以被识别出来的，因为$T$保持他。虽然我们可能很难找到它。\n\n倘若包含在上述演化中的某一个时刻$t_c$所对应的$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$是所有$\\mathbb E_{t}$当中拥有对象最少的（或许这是人一生中的某一个极早时刻），那么这意味着这一稳定结构至多即是某个$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$中的稳定结构，我们把在这种选择下的稳定结构写作$S_{E_c}$。如果你认为这一时刻是某种$\\mathbb E_t$首次出现的时刻，因此有可能独立于经验与感官印象，则你可以将这种稳定结构当中的这一部分认定为“先天”。进一步的，如果你认为$\\mathbb{E}$表示了某种认知，那么假如能够证明这一稳定结构当中的一部分一旦缺失，则无法从$\\mathfrak P_t$中构建任何$\\mathbb{E}_{t}$，则可以将这部分稳定结构称之为“认知结构”。由此，这意味着，在一些哲学框架下，这一稳定结构当中的一部分即有可能是“先天认知结构”[^1]。倘若我们更加平凡的选取$t_a$和$t_b$，不要求演化中包含这样特定的$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$，我们则可以寻找到到更大的和不同的$S_E$，其中则可能除了$S_{E_c}$之外还有其他的（但可能与之相关的）稳定结构，在一些哲学框架下，这些稳定结构可以被认为是后天构建的认知框架。\n\n进一步，在 $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$ 的演化中也应该存在某种稳定结构，这种结构就是我们平时所说的“限定语法规则”之类的东西。\n\n我们已经知道，直接研究 $\\mathbb{E}_t$ 以及 $T_t$ 的演化是困难的。但是我们已经有了函子：\n$$\n(F_{E,L})_t: (\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\to \\mathbb{E}_t\n$$\n这样，我们就可以设想存在某种稳定结构 $S_L$ 在 $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$ 中稳定出现，同时存在某种结构 $S_E$ 在 $\\mathbb{E}_t$ 中保持稳定。通过 $(F_{E,L})_t$（或者某种其他的$(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\to \\mathbb{E}_t$的函子，例如针对某句特定的话内省，当我们看到一句话时其导致我们内心的反应），我们就有可能可以建立一个结构之间的映射关系去至少部分的获取有关 $S_E$ 的信息：\n$$\n(F_{E,L})_t(S_L) \\approx S_E\n$$\n于是我们就可以通过语言游戏研究语言演化中的稳定结构 $S_L$，来间接获得对 $\\mathbb{E}_t$ 中 $S_E$ 的认识，也就是明晰他在感受的范畴之中和其他感受的联系。我们的核心假设是$(F_{E,L})_t(S_L)$和$S_E$至少有一部分重叠。\n\n虽然在这里我们以语言游戏为例，在更好的情况下，我们可以对数个不同的境，例如 $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$ 和 $(\\mathcal{E}_M)_t$等等进行这样的操作，那么通过他们的集合$\\{(F_{E,i})_t(S_i)\\}_i$，我们将能够或许有机会进一步接近$S_E$。事实上，如果我有两个能够以某种形式化的方法（在这里我们的选择是范畴论）去描述的境$(\\mathcal{E}_A)_t$和$(\\mathcal{E}_B)_t$，并且我能够将其中的对象在两个境内进行转换，也就是存在某种$(F_{A \\to B})_t$或者$(F_{B \\to A})_t$，那么，我们之后将会论证，这样的$(F_{A \\to B})_t$必然需要途径$\\mathbb E_t$而捕捉到一部分$\\mathbb E_t$当中到稳定结构。也就是$\\mathbb E_t$中必然存在某些“可被多种形式系统共同描述”的结构，因而这部分稳定结构必然可以用某种形式化的方法（在这里是范畴论）描述。\n\n除了针对$S_E$，我们也可以对其他的存在于$\\mathbb E_t$中的某些结构做类似的研究。这也同时给出了为什么语言游戏作为哲学治疗是有效的，并且将其扩展到其他非语言的境中。\n\n注意到，这里的稳定结构仅仅是描述性的，并且在一些场景下可能具有一定的实用性，但他是否具有某种形而上意义，是否到来某种价值论，例如是否应当追求他，在此我们并未得出结论。\n\n## K1策略：知识的发生\n\n本章节的目的，在于描述语言本身的结构，如何逼迫知识结构的形成。也就是说，某些语言形式似乎强制性地要求我们建立某种特定的“信念–证实”网络， 语言不是只是表达已知知识，而是一种知识验证框架，甚至反向促成了知识结构的构建。一些语句试图“拉出”一组态射，或者指出其断裂：语言行为（如对话、辩护、叙事）要求我们给出论证关系，于是我们开始构造知识结构本身。\n\n接下来考虑$(\\mathcal E_K)_t$，即某一时刻的知识结构。一个形象的理解是其中的对象为信念，射态为证实关系（注意证实关系是一种信念，即是我们认可什么样的论证方式）。我们可以类似$(\\mathcal E_ L)_t$的构造相关的射态和$\\mathcal E_L$。尤为重要的是，存在某种函子\n$$\n(F_{L \\to K})_t: (\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\to (\\mathcal{E}_K)_t\n$$\n即是某一些语句，可以对应某一存在于知识网络中的信念。因为这两个范畴都存在于$\\mathbb E_t$中，因此函子本身作为高阶射态也可以存在于$\\mathbb E_t$中（因为境是塔式结构）。幸运的是，这一函子对于许多人来说恰好确实存在。我们可以通过自省来验证该函子的存在：当我们阅读某句话时，是否能够感受到思想内关于这句话所描述信念的存在，并且确认这一信念在知识网络中的位置：他会令自己联想到哪些其他的信念。\n\n接下来，我们考虑如下过程，通过玩语言游戏，我们构造了在$(\\mathcal{E}_L)_{t}$中的新语句$a$。我们马上可以自省以使用$(F_{L \\to K})_t$将该语句映射为一信念，并在接下来的时刻（$t'$之前）尝试构建知识网络。我们注意到，类似于$(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$，$(\\mathcal E_K)_t$有其内部的某种稳定结构$S_L$，这一稳定结构可以由$(\\mathcal E_K)_t$的演化中识别。而“将该语句映射为一信念并尝试构建知识网络”就是知识范畴的演化过程。根据是否能保持这一特定的稳定结构，$a$所对应的信念将被接受或者拒绝，两种情况都将导致$(\\mathcal E_K)_t$演化为$(\\mathcal E_K)_{t'}$，并且他可能等同或者不等同于$(\\mathcal E_K)_t$（也就是说，即便拒绝，演化后的知识网络不包含$a$所对应的信念，这一演化过程也可能对知识网络产生扰动）。当$a$对应的信念成为$(\\mathcal E_K)_{t'}$的对象时，知识就发生了。\n\n在这一过程中，有两个地方有可能会使用到$\\mathbb{E}_t$中的稳定结构$S_E$。首先，函子$(F_{L \\to K})_t$有可能是通过函子$(F_{E,L})_t$和$(F_{E,K})_t$构建的，例如：\n$$\n(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,L})_t} \\mathbb{E}_t \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,K})_t^{-1}} (\\mathcal{E}_K)_t\n$$\n由此在$(F_{L \\to K})_t$的过程中，由于上一章节的原因，使用（途经/穿过）了$\\mathbb{E}_t$中的$S_E$。或者，函子$(F_{L \\to K})_t$需要通过$\\mathbb{E}_{t}$的演化来生成新的信念感受$a$，然后尝试将其加入知识网络，也就是说，我们可以把$(F_{L \\to K})_t$定义为\n$$\n(F_{L \\to K})_t=(F_{E,K})_{t+1}^{-1} \\circ T_t \\circ (F_{E,L})_t\n$$\n这里使用$\\circ$表示函子的组合以防止歧义。用另一种表达方式，我们可以说：\n$$\n(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,L})_t} \\mathbb{E}_{t+1} \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,K})_{t+1}^{-1}} (\\mathcal{E}_K)_{t+2}\n$$\n此时应当将$(F_{L \\to K})_t$认为是某种特定的开始于时刻$t$的内省过程，并且此处$(F_{E,L})_t$是$T_t$的限制（restriction，可以理解为“子函子”：$(F_{E,L})_t=T_t|_{(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t}$）。不论采用哪种记号，都在$(F_{L \\to K})_t$中都有演化过程，其中可以识别出$S_E$。其次，$(\\mathcal E_K)_t$的演化，遵照上一章节的描述，其内部的特定稳定结构应当可以构成同$S_E$的函子。\n\n最后，这意味着我们可以通过玩语言游戏明晰$S_K$。\n\n## 策略K1：自然变换\n\n我们接下里考虑观察到的他人、语言、数学等对感受到影响。接下来，我将先用数学语言进行描述，然后根据在K1形式中的定义进行解释。我们以数学为例，考虑以下两条路径从 $(\\mathcal{E}_M)_t$ 到 $\\mathbb{E}_{t+1}$：\n\n1.  \n$$\n(\\mathcal{E}_M)_t \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,M})_t} \\mathbb{E}_t \\xrightarrow{T} \\mathbb{E}_{t+1}\n$$\n\n2.  \n$$\n(\\mathcal{E}_M)_t \\xrightarrow{T_M} (\\mathcal{E}_M)_{t+1} \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,M})_{t+1}} \\mathbb{E}_{t+1}\n$$\n其中$T_M$是某种在数学范畴内的演化。注意到这不立刻意味着$T_M$是$T$的限制。\n\n我们可以猜测，存在自然变换：\n$$\nT \\circ (F_{E, M})_t\\Rightarrow(F_{E,M})_{t+1} \\circ T_M\n$$\n\n它意味着，对于每一个公式$a\\in(\\mathcal{E}_M)_t$，都存在一个射态\n$$\n\\eta_a: T((F_{E,M})_t(a)) \\to (F_{E,M})_{t+1}(T_M(a))\n$$\n使得对于任何$(\\mathcal{E}_M)_t$中的射态$f:a\\to a'$\n$$\n(F_{E,M})_{t+1}(T_M(f)) \\circ \\eta_a = \\eta_{a'} \\circ T((F_{E,M})_t(f))\n$$\n\n我们接下来遵照K1形式给出的定义对这两个公式进行解读。\n\n我们首先理解什么是$\\eta_a$。\n$$\n\\eta_a: T((F_{E,M})_t(a)) \\to (F_{E,M})_{t+1}(T_M(a))\n$$\n为了方便理解，让我们使用一个公式$a$的例子：“1+1”$\\xrightarrow{T_M}$“1+1=2”。\n\n注意到，由于$\\eta_a$是$\\mathbb E_t$中的射态，因此它是一种体验。也就是说我们有机会能够通过内省去获得他：\n- 左边（domain）描述当我们看到“1+1”后我们对其进行思考后得到的体验\n- 右边（codomain）描述\"1+1\"遵照数学规律演化为\"1+1=2\"，我们看到了\"1+1=2\"后的体验\n\n也就是说，$\\eta_a$ 是一种在体验中，我们看到 “1+1” 后对其进行思考后所产生的那种感受，与我们看到 “1+1=2” 时所感到的那种感受之间的链接感受。它就像是我们做完一道数学题后，对照参考答案时所经历的那种“确认过程”的体验。我们可以将 $\\eta_a$ 理解为：通过数学结构对思考进行确认的过程，其对应的感受。\n\n特殊地，当 $\\eta_a$ 是单位元时，意味着我们对 “1+1” 的思考结果所带来的感受，与我们直接看到 “1+1=2” 时的感受完全一致，不需要经过任何额外思考来完成确认。就像是我们对照答案时，一眼就意识到自己的解答与参考答案完全一致，不需要任何过程就直接意识到自己脑海当中的推导是对的的那种感觉。是那种无需中介、直接闭合的“直接确认感”。我们可以将这种情况称之为对$a$对掌握。\n\n\n接下来，我们理解自然性条件。\n$$\n(F_{E,M})_{t+1}(T_M(f)) \\circ \\eta_a = \\eta_{a'} \\circ T((F_{E,M})_t(f))\n$$\n我们可以认为$f$为某种联系$a$和$a'$的数学关系（例如由$a$可以推出$a'$），则总的来说\n- $(F_{E,M})_{t+1}(T_M(f))$描述这种数学关系在数学规律中演化，然后被人看到的那个感觉\n- $T((F_{E,M})_t(f))$描述这种数学关系被人看到，然后在人的感受中被演化之后的那个感觉\n- $\\eta_{a'}$描述用数学确认一个公式$a'$的过程体验，这个公式$a'$和公式$a$之间的数学关系是$f$\n\n为了获得更加直觉的理解，让我们使用两个常见的特例来理解这一公式。首先取$f$为某个固定的可逆的（充分必要的）推导关系，也就是说他在函子$T_M$的演化下不变（即我们不使用数学规律把他变为另一种形式）。此时关于这样的$f$的自然性条件可以化简为\n$$\n\\eta_a = \\hat{f}^{-1}_{t+1} \\circ  \\eta_{a'} \\circ T(\\hat{f}_t) \n$$\n其中 $\\hat{f}_t = (F_{E,M})_t(f)$（即 $f$ 在 $\\mathbb{E}_t$ 中的嵌入），以及 $\\hat{f}_{t+1} = (F_{E,M})_{t+1}(f)$（即 $f$ 在 $\\mathbb{E}_{t+1}$ 中的嵌入）。\n\n如果$T(\\hat f_t)=\\hat f_{t+1}$，则\n$$\n\\eta_a = \\hat{f}^{-1}_{t+1} \\circ  \\eta_{a'} \\circ \\hat{f}_{t+1} \n$$\n此时可以证明$\\eta_a$和$\\eta_{a'}$都必须为单位元。这意味着，如果$a$和$a'$在数学上可以通过某种数学关系相互推导（$f:a\\rightarrow a'$且$f$可逆），并且你能稳定的在脑海中重现这种推导过程（$T(\\hat f_t)=\\hat f_{t+1}$）。那么如果你已经掌握了$a'$，则掌握$a$（即获得对$a$的直接确认感）就需要是\n1. 你把$a$按照你脑海当中的推导过程$f$推导为$a'$，\n2. 无需过程就意识到$a'$是对的，\n3. 然后由$a'$重新推出$a$的过程。\n\n如果我无法通过这一过程获取对$a$的直接确认感，则自然性条件不满足。注意到，最后一步由$a'$重新推出$a$的过程是必要的。因为我们可能会偶然地从不理解的结构推出一个简单结果，但却无法从该结果返回推理出原结构的合理性。在这种情况下，我们并不会感觉我们真正“掌握”了 $a$，因为我们无法从已知结构自然地产生出对它的确认体验。\n\n接下来，如果$f$为某个固定的不可逆的（即充分但不必要的）推导关系，此时自然性条件为\n$$\n\\hat{f}_{t+1} \\circ \\eta_a = \\eta_{a'} \\circ T(\\hat{f}_t)\n$$\n注意此时$\\eta_a$和$\\eta_{a'}$不一定是单位元。如果$T(\\hat f_t)=\\hat f_{t+1}$，则\n$$\n\\hat{f}_{t+1} \\circ \\eta_a = \\eta_{a'} \\circ \\hat{f}_{t+1}\n$$\n即要求如下两个整体感受相同或者以某公式$a$的感受按如下路径进行推演后的结果\n- 在等式左边描述成功数学确认$a$后，能够在脑海内使用推到过程从$a$推出$a'$\n- 在等式右边能够在脑海内使用推导过程从$a$推出$a'$后成功对$a'$使用数学进行确认，\n\n我们打一个生活中的比方，想象一个游戏，游戏只有两个选项，选择一项为正确，另一项为错误。如果$a$为游戏攻略中的指南，而$a'$为具体在游戏中的正确操作。如果我能稳定的从指南中描述的游戏玩法推断出具体操作，则\n- 我在玩游戏前游戏攻略确认了玩法，然后在玩的时候从玩法规则在脑内正确的推演了我现在具体要怎么操作\n- 我没有看看游戏攻略确认玩法，直接用印象中的玩法在脑内推演我现在的操作，然后我通过游戏的结果进行确认我的操作\n这两个不同路径能够稳定地达到同样的效果，即是我正确操作并通过了游戏。如果我记错了游戏玩法，那么前者能够通过游戏，而后者则不能；如果游戏在发布攻略后修改了游戏玩法，则前者不能通过游戏，而后者则有可能通过。也就是说，自然性条件可以理解为要求某个范畴的演化和内部感受的演化的一致性：即是说，自然性要求“你以为这个游戏怎么玩”和“这个游戏实际上怎么玩”这两者之间相互契合，这一契合通过对操作结果（作为现象）的确认是否成立，即是否存在$\\eta$，达成。\n\n最后，当$f$在$T_M$下有变换时，类似上面的描述，可以理解为这一变换必须要和我们在脑海中设想的他的变换兼容。\n\n当我们把这一框架使用在语言上，我们可以得到一个经典问题的描述性解答：对于语言来说，是结构先于意义，还是意义先于结构？如果我们认为句子的意义是某一段语言所引发的心理过程，那么我们现在知道，结构和意义之间的关系是自然变换：一句话能够被理解，他必须能够在心理过程的演化和结构的演化中达成如上所述的这种一致性感受$\\eta$，一种对齐。\n- 从语言的角度来说，也就是说如果我们只能改变一个句子的句法结构，那么这个句子要被理解，他必须要“回应”某种给定的心理过程；\n- 从心理的角度来说，也就是说如果我们只能尝试改变自身的心理状态，那么要能读懂一个给定的句子，我们也必须要改变我们的心理状态去“回应”这个句子的结构。\n\n进一步的，我们现在可以做出如下猜测：当你看到一个东西，并且认为你懂这个东西，这意味着这个东西的结构演化与你自身的经验演化之间确立了一个自然变换。形象的说，当你看到“猫跳上了桌子”这句话。这句话在语言中的构造有着固定的演化结构（例如遵照主谓宾的构造方法），而你在逐字阅读这句话的过程（也就是句子演化逐步展开），你在你的脑海中也模拟了这个动作，在脑中看到猫移动、跃起、落到桌上。当这两个演化结构对齐时，你就感到你理解了这句话，而你脑海中的这个过程就被认为是这句话所表达的意义。而当我们无法构建这种自然变换时，例如，当你看到“你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国，记住我给出的原理”，而无法在脑海完成某个对应的的心理过程以同这句话对齐时，你就无法获得“我懂了”的这个感受。\n\n另一方面，如果你通过网络搜索理解了这句话的发生场景，作为meme的意义，当你再次阅读这句话时，虽然你无法从语法的角度理解他，但是你却能够从网络文化的角度获得“我懂了”的感受。这是因为在文化的范畴上这句话的展开（例如他的使用背景、传播方式、引用逻辑）能够以某种对齐的方式在你的心理过程中展开，由此构建了某种代表一致性的感受$\\eta$。\n\n也就是说，“我懂了”并不是对某句话本身的“本体性确认”，而是对$\\eta$所代表的一致性的那种“体验确认”。当我看到一个东西，我是否理解他，取决于这个东西在我的经验结构中是否能被嵌入到某个已理解的结构系统中，并与这个东西的演化之间获得$\\eta$的感受以建立自然变换。\n\n进一步的说，当我们“感受”到他人的感受、明细了某个现象的“意义”时，例如说，当我意识到，这对情侣是真的相爱的时，我感受到的并不是某种实体性的“爱”，而是当我看到这对情侣的互动后，这些现象和我脑海中的经验与模式“共振”，并帮助我最终抵达、或者创造了我的脑海中那个关于“爱”的感受。\n\n## KA猜想：某种稳定结构\n\n最后，让我们考虑$\\mathbb E_t$的子范畴中的稳定结构。\n\n考虑某一个$\\mathbb E_t$中的子范畴$(\\mathcal E_i)_t$，这一子范畴在演化下将保有某种稳定结构$S_i$，如同先前所叙述的。我们现在假设这一稳定结构是某种子范畴，即$S_i$是$\\{(\\mathcal E_i)_{t_j}\\}_j$中每个范畴的子范畴。数学上我们有许多手段去寻找$S_i$，例如寻找不变子范畴，要求$T$或者$T_i$在$S_i$上的作用是恒等或自然等价。在这里我们使用极限（limit）或余极限（colimit）做尝试。\n\n> Todo: KA猜想\n> 这一章节的核心意图是论证在某些假设下，可以推导出《范畴论与境》A1策略中给出的形而上概念作为范性质的定义，（注意到，K1策略并没有使用塔式构造，也没有使用形而上作为范性质的定义。）。也就是说，形而上概念之所以形成，是因为他形成了体验中的某些稳定结构，并且这些稳定结构作为子范畴当中具有某一种范性质，而这一范性质就是我们所以为的那种“本质”，一种“实体”的感觉。进一步的，在这样明晰了形而上的具体结构后，我们可以论证为什么有的体验能够被形而上，而有一些则不行或者较为困难，也就是到底哪些是有效的子范畴（例如我们如何和为什么能从$\\mathbb E$中构造$\\mathcal E_L$）。我们这里可以用笔作为例子，描述我们见到的笔的现象如何聚合为一种“笔”的“物理实体”，然后再如何由诸多的具体的“笔”构成理想的“笔”的概念。进一步的，在最好的情况下，可以通过哲学实验去经验性的验证起点的假设。同样的，这也可以用于明晰概念如何通过境的演化而产生，迁移，和整合。\n> \n> 这或许也是寻找$S_E$的一种方法，当子范畴被选定为整个$\\mathbb E_t$：极限的泛性质是说：对于任何其他范畴X，如果X也有到这个演化链中每个范畴的函子，并且这些函子与演化函子$T_t$相容，那么存在唯一的函子从X到极限范畴。\n> \n> 最后，还可以寻找一种定义方法定义“张力”。张力是指的某种无法确定唯一终对象的状态。这一察觉来源于语言的使用当中，存在一些逻辑和结构使得一句话“说完了”，不论是在文法上还是在表达上。例如说，当论证完成，逻辑达成闭环时，就意味着论证的终止；当我们诉说完对一个事情的抱怨，不再有任何更多的抱怨以抱怨时，就意味着某些话说完了。与之对应的是一种“完满的感觉”。也就是说，存在一种东西，这个东西是所有语言中的子范畴的终对象的对象。我们可以使用内省作为函子回到$\\mathbb E_t$，于是这意味着当一个形而上指向这一终对象时，我们就感到这一形而上完满、一致和结束，我们把这种感受写作$T$。也就是说，如果有一些感受无法被联想到一个范性质时，例如有多个潜在的范性质可能，但是没有完全满足范性质的条件，我们就无法取得$T$。就像是我们被几个不同的逻辑或者价值观卡住而无法做出决定一样（比如说“救对象还是救爸妈”）。\n> \n> 因为语言的范畴的演化是不断说完话的过程，那么感受的演化也就至少一部分是不断“企图获取”$T$的过程。也就是说，如果我们用“目的”这一框架来描述这一过程，那么在这种意味上，我们为什么要不断、继续的讨论哲学，正是因为在一些哲学的领域我们无法找到或者构建一个范性质以获取$T$。这也是哲学治疗为什么有效的原因。\n> \n> 从另一个角度来讲，小孩子的$\\mathfrak P_t$通常比成年人的要小，因此小孩通常容易在$\\mathbb E_t$中获取和构建连接到$T$的感受，因而小孩更容易取得完满的感受。当小孩长大，$\\mathbb E_t$中的内容越来越多，射态越来越复杂，就有可能有更少比例的感受指向$T$，因而较难取得完满的感受，也就是也就是张力。如果在成长过程中，他能够理清思绪或者寻找到某中框架使得大部分感受指向$T$，那么他就又获得了取回$T$的能力，甚至能够主动的整理和构建自己的感受以主动的获取$T$。\n> \n> 注意到，我们在这里依旧是描述性的。人是否应当不断的获取$T$，抑或是人应当怎么看待$T$，$T$是否意味着某种人的意义，未获取$T$的状态是否具有价值，是否我们应该去避免获取$T$，我们在这里并未做出像这样本体论或者价值论的判断。\n> \n> 关于$T$我还有另一点猜想，那就是$T$可能来源于人对边界的识别，也就是说，在《后形而上学》当中，人所具有的那种分与和的能力，能够把视觉信息中把近似的红色的东西归于一块，认为这是一个东西，和周围的东西不是同一个东西的那个能力。在生理上，可以认为这个能力部分来源于人感官的不精确性（合），在思想上，可以认为这个能力来源于人归纳抽象的能力。也就是说，追求$T$的过程，可以理解为对恒常性的追求。\n> \n> 这也回答了美诺悖论：如果我不知道要学什么，那我怎么学？如果我知道了，为什么还要学？现在我们知道，如果我们无法取得$\\eta$感受，那么我们就会觉得我不完全理解一件事情。这可能是网络中存在空洞导致路径缺失，或者是因为网络存在张力：也就是说我们无法组织网络以获得范性质。那么这时我们就知道了“我不知道”在这个结构中可能存在的某个东西或者某个统一的构造有效子范畴的方式。这就是“我要学的那个东西”，但是她不是我已经学会的东西。当通过整理射态，这一网络中形成了某个泛性质、或者当我们取得新的概念补完路径，获取了$\\eta$，那么我们就觉得我们学会了我们之前想学的那个东西。\n> \n> 进一步的，如果我们能够定义张力，那么我们或许可以由此定义潜在。\n\n\n%% 如果有一个A范畴，这个范畴A里有一个终对象。如果有一个范畴B，并且函子F:A->B。函子本身的性质能够保证A的终对象依旧在B中室终对象或者始对象么？如果不能，F需要具有什么样的性质才可以保证这一点？\n一般地：\n如果 $F$ 是右伴随函子，那么 $F$ 会保所有极限（包括终对象）；\n如果 $F$ 是左伴随函子，则它保所有余极限（包括始对象）。\n %%\n## K1策略\n\n我们在这里概括K1策略尝试中所构建的几个方法论\n1. 利用转换函子，我们可以将具有良好形式化范畴中的一些结构映射到其他较难研究的范畴中，通过研究前者探索后者当中的某些结构。这是事实上是大部分哲学研究，例如语言游戏，已经在使用的方法，我们现在给这一方法提供了一种结构表达与描述性解释。\n2. 根据K1形式中给定的定义，我们可以对范畴论得到的数学结果进行解读，其解读结果可能是一些哲学论断。\n3. 如果有某一存在于$\\mathbb E$中的对象或者射态（例如前叙的$\\eta_a$），则它是一种体验。并且我们有可能有机会能够通过内省去获得他。进一步的，我们能够通过构建恰当符合结构的例子去唤醒读者的某一种特定的体验。一旦这一例子得以可重复的在不同读者中确立，那么我们等同于进行了一场“哲学实验”，并得以在实践中对相关的哲学论断进行一定程度的验证。需要强调，我们不需要本体论的验证不同的人获得了“同一”体验（例如Qualia），只需要他们他们具有相同的结构性位置。\n4. 更进一步的，如果我们将这种方法应用于不同的人群，我们或许可以获取跨人群、时间、文化的体验差异和共性。例如，倘若有某一体验能够在成年人中被稳定的唤醒，而在儿童中却较为困难，这或许揭示了某种认知结构的发展机制。倘若有某一体验能够在有神论者中被稳定唤醒，而在无神论者中却较为困难，（或者我们无法找到具有显著性的像这样例子），这或许揭示了宗教体验和理解如何构建认知结构。也就是说，部分哲学问题可以被重新表达为“哪些结构在什么人群中可被诱发”，以及“为什么有些结构在某些人群中无法形成”。哲学结构如果在经验中有稳定呈现，就可以通过实践的心理手段作为验证机制进行经验性验证[^2]。在最好的情况下，某一哲学论断对应的范畴论命题可以由在$\\mathbb E$中的某些对象和射态的存在性推出，并且可以通过设计实验，验证这些感受可以通过符合特定结构的思想实验、文学、音乐、画面、影像、互动游戏等方式进行稳定的唤醒，并且被唤醒的体验处于预计的结构上的位置，由此获得这一哲学论断的经验性验证。\n\n最后，我想要强调，本文所得出的结论是描述性的。例如说，我只是描述性的指出可能存在形如$S_{E_c}$这样的稳定结构和其所处的结构性位置，但是他的本体论地位，是否等同于许多哲学框架中的“先天认知结构”，本文并未得出结论。\n\n但是，一旦我们用结构描述出某些认知结构与经验形态，我们就获得了与之相关的那些引导体验、激发理解、构造认知路径的能力。我们不仅仅可以在实践中对他们进行验证和使用，我们还可以利用他们进行推演和衍生，并在实践中确立新的感受和构建新的结构。\n\n## 写在最后\n\n我想要在最后对在方法论中作为“哲学实验”的核心过程做出一些解释：通过构造特定的结构以唤起相应的体验，以此来查明这一体验所处的结构性位置，并最终将这一结论实践和延展，并以此稳定的唤醒和构造体验。这一过程并不仅仅局限于在本文的框架中使用范畴论来描述结构。事实上，诗歌、文学、艺术、音乐、建筑、游戏、烹饪、旅游、meme等等活动都在不断的进行这一过程，使用各自不同的“语言”以描述结构，只是我们在这里使用了范畴论作为这一工具，一个脚手架，但“哲学实验”的实践是广泛的，并且我们可以观察到他广泛的存在于基本的人类活动之中，我们不断的进行境的构建、体验和演化。一个基本的例子：母亲哄孩子睡觉需要设计声音和节奏的结构以构建某种境来唤醒睡意。也就是说，从某种意义上来说，“You have already made the choice. You are here to try to understand why and how you made it”，我们常常已经选择和构建了产生特定感受和体验的境，我们只是有时候不知道为什么（例如忘记了境是何时或怎么被构建的）我们会最终得到这一体验。如果想要明晰我们对生活、自身、和周遭的困惑，我们可以有察觉的注意到这一点，并尝试理解其内部过程，理清这一切是如何发生。我在这里使用的范畴论仅仅是工具的一种，我们已经有许多现成的工具可以帮助我们达成这一点，并且各有所长。\n\n最后，不论读者是否阅读过，我都邀请读者带着对境的理解再次重新阅读我在2022年写的《[[形而上学后的目的：诗意]]》。这篇文章即是“境”的概念被我第一次提出的时候。\n\n## 一些额外猜想\n\n基于本文的猜想，这意味着，如果我们能够给定一组$S_E$和与其兼容的现象集$\\mathfrak P$，那么我们就可以以他为约束生成$\\mathbb E_t$和其演化。即是任何加入$\\mathbb E_t$的对象和射态所导致的$\\mathbb E_t$的演化都必须保证$S_E$的稳定存在，同$S_E$兼容。这意味着，根据$S_E$的不同，我们可以或许可以构造出，至少是现象上来说，具有认知结构的不同实体。一个可能的候选是以某种Homotopy Type Theory的框架作为$S_E$。\n\n[^1]: 注意到，这里有一个问题，那就是$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$时就已经有$\\mathfrak P_{t_c}$，我们不知道$\\mathfrak P$是否在$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$之前就已经存在。进一步的，因为$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$中已经有现象，因此$S_E$当中也可能有现象。换而言之，我们有几种理解先天认知结构的方法。我们这里列出几种，一种是先天认知结构是一种存在于任何现象之前的东西$\\mathbb E_{0}$，$\\mathbb E_{0}$和$\\mathfrak P_{t_c}$共同决定了$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$；另一种是现象的可能形式是由先天认知结构$\\mathbb E_{0}$所决定的，即$\\mathbb E_{0}$决定了$\\mathfrak P_{t_c}$再产生$\\mathbb E_{t_c}$；还有一种是我们认为先天认知结构就是现象的形式，那么$\\mathfrak P_{t_c}$当中就已经包含了先天认知结构。如此等等。注意到，$\\mathbb E_{0}$不在$\\mathfrak P_{t_c}$之中，而$\\mathfrak P_{t_c}$是我们所能探索的边界，因此我们无法对$\\mathbb E_{0}$进行探查。不论如何理解，这些看法只是对$S_E$对本体论位置进行确认，我们事实上能查明的最小稳定结构就是$S_E$。\n[^2]: 注意到，这是一个关于经验的分析判断：如果一个东西在经验中有稳定呈现，就可以进行经验性验证。","numLines":263,"startLine":1,"totalLines":263}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"0b0cce27-f029-4e13-9cde-655efee05063"}
