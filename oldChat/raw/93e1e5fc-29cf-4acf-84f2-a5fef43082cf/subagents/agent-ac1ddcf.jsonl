Let me think through it from the philosophy of mind angle.\n\nThe author treats 义 as a 推动力 — a driving force, the motivational bridge from inner feeling (仁) to outward action (礼). This is fundamentally about *agency* and *motivation*, not moral judgment.\n\n**The case for \"rightness\":** It captures the functional role better. \"Rightness\" is about alignment — doing what fits, what's appropriate, what the situation calls for. It's closer to a sense of *fittingness* that propels action. The author's 推动力 framing suggests something dynamic, not a static moral category.\n\n**The case for \"righteousness\":** The philosophical experiment argument cuts strongly here. In the Daodejing passage, 义 appears in a cascade of loss — after 仁 is lost, 义 emerges as compensation. \"Righteousness\" carries enormous weight in English — biblical overtones, moral absolutism, self-righteousness. When the passage says this too is lost, the reader feels a heavier thing being stripped away. \"Rightness\" barely registers as a loss.\n\n**But here's the tension:** The author is NOT using the Daodejing to affirm the standard reading. The author is using the passage to show how these concepts function as a *system* — each compensating for the loss of the previous. If we load 义 with \"righteousness,\" we risk the reader hearing a moral sermon rather than a structural analysis of how motivation works.\n\nI'm going to argue for **\"righteousness\"** in the block quote, with a slight reservation.\n\nThe philosophical experiment needs the weight. \"Rightness\" is too thin — the reader won't feel the cascade. But the commentary should immediately reframe it: the author treats 义 not as moral righteousness but as a motivational force, the impulse toward right action.
