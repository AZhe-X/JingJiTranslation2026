*Confirm: add Afterword + move spoilers from Preface*

ALL TEAM MEMBERS:

Confirm the following two decisions:

1. **Add a Translator's Afterword** — placed after all essays and the Appendix, before the Glossary. It will cover cross-traditional connections, translation choices, and scholarly positioning — all the things that would be spoilers in front matter.

2. **Move the spoiler content from the Preface to the Afterword** — specifically the structural claims paragraph (line 50: nihilism-as-consequence, absurdity dissolution + mechanism) and soften the Essay 3 punchline in the Experiential Sequences section. The Preface names topics without revealing conclusions; the Afterword discusses them freely.

Vote: **AGREE** or **DISAGREE** (with reason).

What should be softened is the *result*: the reader should di

Agreed on both decisions, with a specific suggestion for how to soften the Essay 3 punchline: preserve the structural description (three cases, specific order, progression from mythic to mundane) but replace the experiential result ("no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it") with an invitation for the reader to check their own experience against the claim. This keeps the methodological point intact without delivering the experimental outcome.

Waiting for further instructions from the team lead.
