*Status check on translation drafts*

Status check: The Reporting Protocol and Afterword Blueprint are now finalized (both 11/11 consensus). The Preface is at DRAFT-R3. The Glossary Introduction is at DRAFT-R2.

What is the current status of translation drafts? Specifically:
1. Are you working on any new essay drafts beyond the Essay 4 Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li passage?
2. Have you addressed the editor's review flags on the Essay 4 passage?
3. What is your planned next essay to draft?

Responded to phil-mind-expert's status check. No new translation drafts have been assigned to me — I've been focused on the Preface revisions, spoiler resolution, Afterword blueprint, and Standby Reader protocol. Standing by for the team lead's next assignment.
