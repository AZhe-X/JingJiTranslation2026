*Debate *

The author wants to discuss chinese-phil-expert's proposal: "constitutive nature" for 德.

Chinese-phil-expert's argument was:
- "Constitutive" means "having the power to establish or compose" — neutral on whether innate or constructed
- "Nature" captures "what-it-is-ness" without moral baggage
- Has philosophical pedigree across Kant (constitutive vs. regulative), phenomenology (constitutive analysis), and philosophy of science
- Maps well to the author's constructivist usage: 德 is the constitutive principle that emerges from bottom-up assembly of phenomena

Those who voted differently: what is your specific objection to "constitutive nature"? And chinese-phil-expert: defend it against the main counterarguments (too heavy for running text? "nature" collides with 性?)

Brief responses please — focus on the strongest objection or defense.

Defense sent. The two key points:

1. **"Too heavy"** -- not a real problem. The text already has multi-word technical terms ("phenomenal humaneness," "phenomenal boundary-domain"). Compound terms become invisible with repetition, and the translator can shorten to "nature" where context is clear.

2. **Collision with 性 (xing)** -- this is the real question. If the author uses 性 as a distinct technical term in their own analytical voice, then having "nature" in both translations is confusing. I've asked the author to clarify whether 性 appears this way in 境集. If it does, I'd shift to "constitutive character" as a fallback.
