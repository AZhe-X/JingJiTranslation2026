Lines 95-96: AMEND to restore three cases.\">\nThank you for flagging the divergences. To clarify:\n\n**1. Line 50 (structural claims paragraph):** I do NOT formally AMEND. The unified proposal's full replacement is the better editorial decision. My hybrid was drafted before I saw the Kantian expert's suggestion that the unified proposal adapted, and on reflection the clean cut is superior — it avoids the problem of having to calibrate exactly how much of a conclusion counts as a \"minimal hint.\" I AGREE with the unified proposal's version.\n\n**2. Lines 95-96 (Essay 3 specific examples):** This is the inconsistency you caught — my section 1C removed them but my section 3 said they're fine. My section 3 is correct; the section 1C draft was written earlier and I failed to reconcile them. I formally **AMEND** Edit 3 to restore the three specific cases. My proposed replacement text (already sent in my previous message):\n\n\"In Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload — the final example is designed to produce a recognition that the reader must encounter firsthand. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\"\n\nRationale: the cases are already in the essay title and table of contents; removing them from the Preface doesn't protect anything and makes the description too abstract. The spoiler is the recognition, not the cases.\n\nAlso noting: the unified proposal's Edit 3 contains \"lived experience\" (\"the reader is invited to test the essay's claim against their own lived experience\"), which should be avoided per Translation Dictionary.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"1e8da3ba-e145-44a5-b3ab-d08b5b285cdf","timestamp":"2026-02-11T07:52:12.125Z"}
