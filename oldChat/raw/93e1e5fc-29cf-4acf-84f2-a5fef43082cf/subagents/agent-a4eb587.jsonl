Specific comments:\n\n**Revision 1:** Good. My original suggestion adopted.\n\n**Revision 2:** Strongly agree. The Fish/Fishing distinction depends on the reader not knowing they are undergoing philosophical experiments during Part 1. Glad this achieved consensus.\n\n**Revision 3:** Clean improvement. No issues.\n\n**Revision 4:** \"Stayed with you / didn't land\" is better framing. Agree with the shift from evaluative to experiential.\n\n**Revision 5:** The revised optional framing (\"If you made any marks or notes...\") addresses my concern. Good.\n\n**Revision 6:** Unanimous, as expected. The architecture is correct: generic during, specific after.\n\n**Revision 7:** The expansion to 8 probes is well-designed. I note that my original suggestion for Essay 5 (\"The author distinguishes two ways of being in a dreamscape. What did you make of this distinction?\") has been simplified to \"What did you make of the dreamscape concept?\" — I actually prefer the synthesized version. It is more open-ended and does not even hint that there is a binary distinction to be found. If the reader independently identifies the lucid/intoxicated split, that is stronger evidence than if we pointed them toward \"two ways.\" Good editorial call.\n\nFor Essay 1, the probe \"there's an extended comparison to physics — how did that land for you?\" is better than my original suggestion about individuals and groups. It tests both the physics-as-philosophy method and the reader's comfort with cross-domain reasoning, without revealing the essay's conclusion.\n\n**Revision 8:** Useful internal note. The Essay 5 to Essay 6 transition is indeed the sharpest register shift. From my domain, this is also where the collection shifts from something resembling Chan-style direct pointing (essays 1-5 work through examples and felt experience) to something resembling Abhidharma-style systematic analysis (essays 6-7 formalize the structures). If the reader loses momentum here, it may indicate that the bridge between experiential and formal needs strengthening.\n\nNo amendments needed. Full approval.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"ccbbe3c7-6fa9-4fb0-989f-a44103362b01","timestamp":"2026-02-11T09:22:19.112Z"}
