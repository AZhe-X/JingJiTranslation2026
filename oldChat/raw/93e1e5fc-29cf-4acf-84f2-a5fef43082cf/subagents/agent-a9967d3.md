*Vote: add standby reader to review finished drafts?*

**Vote:** Should we add a **standby reader** to the team — someone who reviews finished drafts from the perspective of a general reader (not a philosophical expert), checking for clarity, readability, and whether the experiential sequences work as intended for a non-specialist audience?

Vote: **YES** or **NO**, with brief reason.

The collection is explicitly designed to work for readers without philosophical training (the author says to skip formalism if needed, provides everyday examples, etc.), and the experiential sequences must land for non-specialists to function as philosophical experiments. A standby reader would catch the gap between what we think is clear and what actually is — which is precisely the kind of gap this collection argues we are prone to overlooking.",
