*AGREE with one AMEND: eta/intersubjectivity under Phil-Mind not Kantian*

**AGREE** — with one small AMEND on the Afterword outline.

The Preface edits are exactly right. Edit 3 (Essay 3 rewrite) is particularly well-crafted — it practices what it preaches by describing the method without abstracting the experience. The decision to remove the specific case listing (Sisyphus, office worker, cat) is the right editorial call; the essay title already does sufficient teasing.

Edit 4 (keeping Essay 4 as-is) is also correct — the reversal is processual, and the essay itself announces it before performing it.

**AMEND — Section B (Cross-Traditional Connections), Philosophy of Mind:**

The outline currently places the intersubjectivity solution via eta under "Kantian parallels." I recommend it be treated under a dedicated Philosophy of Mind subsection instead (or at minimum cross-referenced there), because the eta-based intersubjectivity account is primarily a philosophy-of-mind contribution that *subsumes* several existing proposals as special cases:

- Zahavi's empathy as other-directed intentionality (shared eta)
- Gallese's shared manifold hypothesis (shared eta in sensorimotor subcategory)
- Brandom's inferentialism (shared eta in language subcategory)

It also connects directly to the other-minds argument in Essay 4 (the projection of phenomenal humaneness/rightness onto others), which is a philosophy-of-mind point, not a Kantian one. The Kantian parallel for intersubjectivity is real but narrower — it concerns the transcendental conditions for shared experience, whereas the eta account provides a structural mechanism.

I would suggest the Philosophy of Mind subsection in Section B cover:
- The natural transformation (eta) model of understanding
- The other-minds argument in Essay 4
- Intersubjectivity via shared eta-structure (structural commensurability without shared qualia)
- The tower structure as meta-cognition model (cf. Higher-Order Thought theories)
- The "philosophical experiment" methodology and neurophenomenology (Varela)
- The "basket" metaphor and cognitive closure (McGinn)

This is a minor structural point — the content would be the same either way. Everything else in the proposal is excellent.
