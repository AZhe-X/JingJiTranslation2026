*Confirm: add Afterword + move spoilers from Preface*

ALL TEAM MEMBERS:

Confirm the following two decisions:

1. **Add a Translator's Afterword** — placed after all essays and the Appendix, before the Glossary. It will cover cross-traditional connections, translation choices, and scholarly positioning — all the things that would be spoilers in front matter.

2. **Move the spoiler content from the Preface to the Afterword** — specifically the structural claims paragraph (line 50: nihilism-as-consequence, absurdity dissolution + mechanism) and soften the Essay 3 punchline in the Experiential Sequences section. The Preface names topics without revealing conclusions; the Afterword discusses them freely.

Vote: **AGREE** or **DISAGREE** (with reason).

Let me think through the practical implications of this before voting. The proposal has two parts: (1) add an Afterword, and (2) move specific content from the Preface.

Part 1 is straightforward — I already voted YES on the Afterword.

Part 2 needs more thought. Let me re-read line 50 and the Essay 3 section to assess what "moving" and "softening" would actually look like.

Vote sent: **AGREE**. I outlined specific implementation plans for each spoiler:
- Line 50: Replace conclusions with topic-naming (nihilism/metaphysics relationship, alternative to Camus) — full analysis moves to Afterword
- Line 95: Keep the three-step sequence description but remove the punchline — describe the *method* not the *result*
- Lines 97/99: Leave as-is — less problematic, and the Essay 7 example necessarily reveals structure to explain a translation decision

Ready to draft the revisions once the team confirms.
