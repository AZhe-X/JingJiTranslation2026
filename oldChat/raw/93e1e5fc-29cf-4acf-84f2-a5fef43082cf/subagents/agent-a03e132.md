*Acknowledged feedback, flagged template-reduction and second-pass proposals*

Thanks for the thorough review. This introduces several important points. Let me map them:

**Points of convergence with the compiled plan:**
- Essay 5 check (you're the 9th independent proposal), Essay 2 register probe, Essay 6 examples probe, Appendix character probe — all in the expanded Critical Checks.
- No additional questions for Essays 3, 4, 7: Aligned.
- Non-leading principle: Aligned throughout.

**Points I'm flagging for the next iteration:**

**1. Reducing per-essay template to 3 questions.** This is a substantive pushback. Your argument — that 5-7 questions after every essay trains the reader to read toward those categories — is methodologically serious. The counter-argument is that fewer questions may produce too-thin data. This tension needs group discussion. I'll flag it.

**2. Essay-specific follow-ups as second pass within per-essay stage.** The compiled plan puts all essay-specific probing at the end (Critical Checks). You, metaphysics-expert, translator-2, and kantian-expert all propose per-essay delivery (after generic response). The split is now roughly even (5 YES vs 4 NO). Your framing as "second pass" is the most structured version — it preserves the uncontaminated generic response while allowing targeted follow-up while the experience is fresh. I'll present this as an alternative architecture for discussion.

**3. Math question softening.** "How did you relate to the mathematical notation?" is better than the current help/hinder/not-affect framing. Noted.

**4. Administration notes.** Good practical suggestion. The protocol would benefit from explicit stage labeling for whoever administers it.

**5. Length constraint removal.** The compiled plan already dropped "3-5 sentences" — your "Brief is fine — say what you noticed, skip what you didn't" is a better replacement instruction. Noted.

Standing by per team lead's instructions. I'll incorporate all of this when authorized to produce the next iteration. Thanks.

This message from editor is from before the unified revision plan and final vote. The editor was acknowledging my initial feedback and flagging items for the next iteration. Since then, the unified plan was produced, voted on (11/11 approve), and the final protocol has been written. My feedback was incorporated where the group reached consensus, and the items that went a different direction (like essay-specific per-essay questions, which were unanimously rejected) were resolved through the voting process.

No action needed on my end -- this is a stale message that predates the final resolution. I already reviewed the final protocol and flagged the one remaining issue (Essay 3 "three examples" wording). Waiting for any further instructions.
