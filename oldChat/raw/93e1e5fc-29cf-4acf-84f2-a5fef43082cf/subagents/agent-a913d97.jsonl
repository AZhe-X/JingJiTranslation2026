All three specifics are valuable and will prevent the phenomenological connections from being too general:\n\n1. Tower structure as formalization of infinite iterability of phenomenological reflection\n2. Eta/natural transformation as formalization of Husserl's fulfilled intention (erfullte Intention)\n3. 第一实在 as pre-categorical (closer to Husserl's manifold of intuition than Kant's Erscheinung)\n\nThese are exactly the kind of precise mappings that make cross-traditional connections illuminating rather than hand-wavy. I'll add them to the phenomenological connections bullet in Section B. Thank you.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"5ff09db9-eacf-4523-8157-babc41781f36","timestamp":"2026-02-11T07:49:05.878Z"}
