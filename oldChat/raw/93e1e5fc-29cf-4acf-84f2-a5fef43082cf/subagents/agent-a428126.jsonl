Is losing this etymological wordplay a big problem for the reader's understanding of the passage?\n2. If so, should we add a TN explaining the 形/形而上 structure?\n3. Or is there a way to render it in English that preserves the relationship (e.g., \"above-the-phenomenal\" for 形而上)?\n\nBrief responses.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"351b0396-7fa4-40bf-a779-ca0021aca1d5","timestamp":"2026-02-11T02:37:01.217Z"}
