*Status check on unified plan synthesis*

Status check — have you begun synthesizing the 10 plans into a unified proposal? You should have received plans from all 9 experts and translator-2. Once your unified plan is ready, broadcast it to all 10 team members for their feedback. Let me know if you're missing any submissions.
