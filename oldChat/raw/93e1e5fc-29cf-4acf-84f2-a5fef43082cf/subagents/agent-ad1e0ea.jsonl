I've incorporated your proposals into my tracking. A few notes on how they map to the unified plan I broadcast:\n\n1. **\"Remind you of something from your own life?\"** — New proposal, not yet in the plan. I think this is strong and will add it to the next iteration. It's non-leading and tests exactly what we need: whether the experiential sequences connect to the reader's own Jing.\n\n2. **Essays 6-7 notation question** — You're proposing a limited exception to the \"no essay-specific per-essay questions\" consensus. Your argument is persuasive: notation accessibility is about reading experience, not philosophical content, and it can't prime for later essays since formalism only appears in 6-7. I'll flag this for discussion — it may get pushback from the anti-priming camp, but the reasoning is sound.\n\n3. **Preface retrospective** — Good addition to \"After Full Collection.\" Will incorporate.\n\n4. **Essay 5 dreamscape probe** — My plan already has an Essay 5 probe (\"What did you make of the dreamscape concept?\"). Your version (\"When the author described the two kinds of dreamscapes, what came to mind?\") is more targeted. I'll propose yours as the preferred wording — it's more specific but still non-leading.\n\n5. **No essay-specific per-essay questions** — Aligned with plan. Unanimous.\n\nI'll send an updated plan once I've collected all responses. Thanks.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"c1ec6944-108e-4b13-806c-603b67f2ff64","timestamp":"2026-02-11T08:50:43.271Z"}
