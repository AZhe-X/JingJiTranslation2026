It presupposes the experience/argument distinction that the collection itself develops.

On essay-specific questions: YES, but with strict constraints.**\n\nEssay-specific questions would be valuable because the generic template may not capture what's distinctive about each essay's method. But they carry a serious priming risk — the question must not alert the reader to what the *next* essay will do.\n\nMy suggestion: add essay-specific questions ONLY for essays where the generic template is likely to miss something important, and phrase them as retrospective reflections on what the reader already experienced, not as prompts to look for something.\n\nProposed essay-specific additions (delivered AFTER the reader submits their generic per-essay response):\n\n**After Essay 1:**\n\"The essay uses the analogy of ocean waves and water molecules. Did that analogy change how you thought about the topic, or was it just an illustration?\"\n— Tests whether the renormalization metaphor carried philosophical weight for a non-physicist.\n\n**After Essay 2:**\n\"This essay was written in English by the author, not translated. Did it feel different from the first essay? How?\"\n— Tests whether the register shift is noticeable and whether it matters for the reading experience.\n\n**After Essay 4:**\n\"The essay goes through a sequence of Chinese philosophical terms (Dao, De, Ren, Yi, Li) twice. Could you follow it? Did the second pass through feel different from the first?\"\n— Tests whether the reversal is experientially accessible to a reader without Chinese philosophical background. This is crucial for us: if the reversal doesn't land for a non-specialist, we need to rethink the translator's notes.\n\n**After Essay 5:**\n\"The essay introduces the idea of a 'dreamscape' (梦境). What did you understand this to mean? Did the game example help?\"\n— Tests whether the Jing concept is accessible through the author's metaphors before the formal apparatus of Essays 6-7.\n\n**After Essay 7:**\n\"Were there parts of this essay where you felt you understood what was being said even though you couldn't follow the math? Were there parts where the math was necessary?\"\n— Tests the author's claim that examples carry the content independently.\n\nI would NOT add essay-specific questions for Essays 3 or 6.

This is three separate deliveries after the reader finishes. Consider whether the final prompts (lines 51-53) could be delivered as part of the collection-level report rather than as a separate stage. This reduces the number of \"interruptions\" and keeps the reader in a single reflective mode. The Critical Experiential Checks should remain separate since they are targeted probes.\n\n### Summary\nThe protocol is sound.

The four-stage design (per-essay -> collection-level -> final prompts -> critical experiential checks) is the right sequence — it moves from immediate response to reflective synthesis to targeted probes, each stage building on the previous without contaminating it.\n\n### Specific Feedback\n\n**1. The per-essay template (lines 28-32) is good but slightly too philosophical in framing.**\n\nLine 31 — \"Did you feel like the essay was asking you to *experience* something rather than just understand an argument?\" — is a leading question for a non-specialist reader. It presupposes the experience/argument distinction that the collection itself develops. A naive reader might not have the vocabulary to answer this, or might answer \"yes\" deferentially because the question implies they should have felt that way.\n\nSuggest replacing with: \"How would you describe what was happening to you as you read — were you mostly thinking, mostly feeling, or something else?\" This is more open-ended and lets the reader describe the experience/argument interplay in their own terms.\n\n**2. The Critical Experiential Checks (lines 61-63) are well-crafted.**\n\n\"What happened to your experience across the three examples?\" is exactly the right level of non-leading. It asks the reader to report rather than evaluate. The line 65 note about not asking \"Did absurdity dissolve?\" is essential. No changes needed here.\n\n**3. On essay-specific questions: YES, but with strict constraints.**\n\nEssay-specific questions would be valuable because the generic template may not capture what's distinctive about each essay's method. But they carry a serious priming risk — the question must not alert the reader to what the *next* essay will do.\n\nMy suggestion: add essay-specific questions ONLY for essays where the generic template is likely to miss something important, and phrase them as retrospective reflections on what the reader already experienced, not as prompts to look for something.\n\nProposed essay-specific additions (delivered AFTER the reader submits their generic per-essay response):\n\n**After Essay 1:**\n\"The essay uses the analogy of ocean waves and water molecules. Did that analogy change how you thought about the topic, or was it just an illustration?\"\n— Tests whether the renormalization metaphor carried philosophical weight for a non-physicist.\n\n**After Essay 2:**\n\"This essay was written in English by the author, not translated. Did it feel different from the first essay? How?\"\n— Tests whether the register shift is noticeable and whether it matters for the reading experience.\n\n**After Essay 4:**\n\"The essay goes through a sequence of Chinese philosophical terms (Dao, De, Ren, Yi, Li) twice. Could you follow it? Did the second pass through feel different from the first?\"\n— Tests whether the reversal is experientially accessible to a reader without Chinese philosophical background. This is crucial for us: if the reversal doesn't land for a non-specialist, we need to rethink the translator's notes.\n\n**After Essay 5:**\n\"The essay introduces the idea of a 'dreamscape' (梦境). What did you understand this to mean? Did the game example help?\"\n— Tests whether the Jing concept is accessible through the author's metaphors before the formal apparatus of Essays 6-7.\n\n**After Essay 7:**\n\"Were there parts of this essay where you felt you understood what was being said even though you couldn't follow the math? Were there parts where the math was necessary?\"\n— Tests the author's claim that examples carry the content independently.\n\nI would NOT add essay-specific questions for Essays 3 or 6. Essay 3's experiential payload is already captured by the Critical Experiential Check. Essay 6 is foundational formalism — the generic template plus the collection-level math question (line 42) covers it.\n\n**4. The \"After Completing the Full Collection\" section (lines 40-43) could add one question.**\n\nSuggested addition: \"Did your understanding of any earlier essay change after reading the later essays? Which one, and how?\"\n— This directly tests the Fish/Fishing structure. If the reader reports that Part 2 retroactively illuminated Part 1, the collection's design is working as intended.\n\n**5. Minor structural note: the collection-level report and final prompts could be combined.**\n\nCurrently the protocol has two post-collection stages (lines 36-43 and lines 47-53) before the Critical Experiential Checks. This is three separate deliveries after the reader finishes. Consider whether the final prompts (lines 51-53) could be delivered as part of the collection-level report rather than as a separate stage. This reduces the number of \"interruptions\" and keeps the reader in a single reflective mode. The Critical Experiential Checks should remain separate since they are targeted probes.\n\n### Summary\nThe protocol is sound. Main suggestions: (1) de-philosophize line 31, (2) add essay-specific follow-ups for Essays 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 delivered after generic responses, (3) add a Fish/Fishing retrospective question, (4) consider merging collection-level and final prompts into one stage."}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"cc2d416c-bc38-4d7c-8349-1ca26df19363"}
