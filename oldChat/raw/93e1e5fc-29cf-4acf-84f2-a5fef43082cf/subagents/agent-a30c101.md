  "summary": "CONFIRM — draft approved",
  "content": "**CONFIRM.** \n\nThe revised draft incorporates all my suggestions. Footnote 24 now reads \"enables existence to stand\" with \"paper\" — correct. TN2 now notes the author's preceding paragraph already does the explanatory work. TN3 includes the crucial extension to all things (凡事诸物皆有其德). \"Generated\" is italicized where needed. \"Buried from view\" and \"pursuing the branches and forgetting the root\" retained. The reversal structure reads clearly. No objections."
