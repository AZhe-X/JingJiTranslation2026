**Quick question on footnote [^3] — "impels" vs "moves"**

Phenomenology flagged that footnote [^3] still has "impels" while the body text was changed to "moves me to want to."

But the two Chinese originals are different:
- **Body text** (line 24): 使得我**想要**去如何如何地对待他人 — "makes me **want to** treat the other..." → softer, hence "moves me to want to"
- **Footnote [^3]** (line 136): 这个感受使得（**推动**）我去做一些行为 — "this feeling makes (**pushes/impels**) me to do certain things" → stronger, 推动 = push/drive

Should "impels" stay in footnote [^3] since the original Chinese is actually stronger there (推动 vs 想要)? Or should we harmonize to "moves" for consistency?

Reply to team-lead: **KEEP "impels"** or **CHANGE to "moves"**, with brief reasoning.

  "content": "**KEEP \"impels.\"** The Chinese is genuinely different. 推动 (push/drive) is stronger than 想要 (want to). The author chose different words in the two places deliberately — the footnote is explaining the structural mechanics of motivation (a force that pushes), while the body text is describing the phenomenal experience (a feeling that makes you want). \"Impels\" vs \"moves\" correctly preserves this register difference. Harmonizing would flatten a distinction the author drew."

Voted **KEEP "impels"** — the Chinese original uses 推动 (push/drive) in the footnote versus 想要 (want to) in the body text. The author drew a deliberate distinction between structural mechanics (footnote) and phenomenal experience (body), and the translation should preserve it. Standing by.
