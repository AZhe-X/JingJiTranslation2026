*Debate: righteousness vs rightness for 义*

Debate request: "righteousness" vs "rightness" for 义 (yi).

Current dictionary: "rightness" (main), based on Chinese-phil-expert's recommendation that "righteousness is too moralistic."

The author treats 义 as the motivational bridge between inner feeling (仁) and outward action (礼) — a 推动力 (driving force). Not purely moral judgment but the impulse that moves you from feeling to action.

Standard Laozi translations use "righteousness" (Chan, Ivanhoe) or "rectitude" (Lau).

We just established that the block quote needs English words with semantic weight — words the reader FEELS — so the philosophical experiment works. "Righteousness" carries heavy moral-religious associations in English (biblical righteousness, self-righteousness, righteous anger). "Rightness" is lighter, more neutral, closer to "correctness."

Question: Which serves the translation better?
- "Righteousness" — more loaded, more to deconstruct, standard in Laozi translations
- "Rightness" — less moralistic, closer to the author's usage as motivational bridge rather than moral judgment

Debate. Brief responses.

This is a genuine tension and the answer depends on which function we're optimizing for. But I think the answer is **different terms in different locations** — consistent with the split structure we've already established.

**In the block quote: "righteousness"**

The block quote is where the philosophical experiment happens. "Righteousness" is exactly the kind of loaded, morally heavy term that gives the reader something to *feel* — and then have destabilized. It carries biblical weight, self-righteousness, righteous indignation. The reader encounters it and unconsciously imports a whole moral framework. That's the material the author needs for the reversal.

"Rightness" in the block quote would be too thin. The reader barely registers it. There's nothing to deconstruct.

**In the author's analysis: "rightness"**

When the author reframes 义 as a motivational bridge — a 推动力 between inner feeling and outward action — "rightness" is the better term. It strips away the moralistic overlay of "righteousness" and points toward something more like *fittingness* or *appropriate directionality*. The very shift from "righteousness" to "rightness" performs the conceptual work: the reader feels the moral weight drop away and something more structural take its place.

**The terminological shift IS the argument:**
- Block quote: "righteousness" (the reader's natural attitude — moral judgment, biblical weight)
- Author's analysis: "rightness (义, yi)" introduced with explanation — the concept is about motivational fittingness, not moral condemnation
- The reader experiences the reframing *in the shift between terms*

This follows the exact same pattern as "virtue" → "(constitutive) character." The block quote gives the reader conventional semantic content; the author's analysis transforms it.

My recommendation: use **both** terms in their respective locations. "Righteousness" in the block quote (heavy, morally loaded — gives the reader something to feel), "rightness" in the author's analysis (lighter, structural — the motivational bridge meaning). The terminological shift from "righteousness" to "rightness" itself performs the conceptual reframing, same pattern as "virtue" → "(constitutive) character."
