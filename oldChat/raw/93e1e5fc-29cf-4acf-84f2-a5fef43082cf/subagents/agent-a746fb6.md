*Standard translations all use *

New data for the 德 discussion. The passage 故失道而后德，失德而后仁，失仁而后义，失义而后礼 (Dao De Jing Ch. 38) has well-established standard English translations:

**D.C. Lau**: "When the way was lost there was virtue; when virtue was lost there was benevolence; when benevolence was lost there was rectitude; when rectitude was lost there were the rites."

**Wing-tsit Chan**: "When the Way is lost, only then do we have virtue; when virtue is lost, only then do we have humanity; when humanity is lost, only then do we have righteousness; when righteousness is lost, only then do we have propriety."

**James Legge**: "When the Tao was lost, its attributes appeared; when its attributes were lost, benevolence appeared; when benevolence was lost, righteousness appeared; when righteousness was lost, the proprieties appeared."

Every major translator uses "virtue" for 德 in this passage. Our decision was "(constitutive) character" instead.

Given this data — does this change your view? Should we:
A) Keep "(constitutive) character" — our reasoned departure from tradition, acknowledged in TN
B) Use the standard "virtue" for the Laozi block quote specifically (since it IS a quotation of a classical text), then switch to "(constitutive) character" when the author begins their own analysis
C) Something else?

Brief response with your recommendation.

Using \"character\" there would create unnecessary friction — the reader who knows the DDJ would stumble, and the reader who does not would lose the ability to cross-reference. \n\nThen when the author steps into their own analytical voice and begins working with 德 as a concept in their argument, switch to \"(constitutive) character\" with the TN explaining the departure. This respects both the canonical translation tradition and the author's distinctive philosophical usage.",
