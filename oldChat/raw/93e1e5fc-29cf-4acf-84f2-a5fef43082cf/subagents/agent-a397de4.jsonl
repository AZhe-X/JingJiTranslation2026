Both additions are exactly the kind of precise, additive content the Afterword needs:\n\n1. **Xunzi's 礼论 as closest precedent + point of departure** — this gives the English reader a calibration point for the author's originality. The distinction (Xunzi constructs 礼 bottom-up but stops at 道; the author carries construction all the way up) is sharp and illuminating.\n\n2. **子非鱼 as classical framing of the intersubjectivity problem** — this complements the Phil-Mind subsection's treatment of eta by providing the Chinese philosophical context. The three-stage framing (Zhuangzi raises it, Confucians assume it away, the author resolves it structurally) is excellent.\n\nI'll replace the Chinese philosophy bullet in Section B with your amended version. Thank you.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"3a8c757c-0d8f-4334-b16d-a54b4dbbb548","timestamp":"2026-02-11T07:50:14.431Z"}
