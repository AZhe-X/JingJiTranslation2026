*Correction: use 整理 version only, not 其一*

**CORRECTION**: Use the 整理 (cleaned-up) version of 后形而上学, NOT the 其一 (draft) version. The 8 essays are:

1. `22 随笔/关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一.md`
2. `23 Reflection/A Thought on Knowledge.md`
3. `22 随笔/西西弗斯、班与猫.md`
4. `21 无知者的自我记录/后形而上学 整理.md`
5. `21 无知者的自我记录/形而上学后的目的：诗意.md`
6. `21 无知者的自我记录/范畴论与境.md`
7. `21 无知者的自我记录/范畴论与境：K1策略.md`
8. `21 无知者的自我记录/关于诗意和境的一些零散想法.md`

Do NOT load 后形而上学 其一. Only the 整理 version.

No changes needed.",

Correction acknowledged. My analysis was already based on the correct 8 essays; the 其一 references were supplementary and don't affect the recommendation. Standing by for the debate responses.
