These are consulting functions. My English prose tends toward the scholarly-technical register (as this report demonstrates), which is not necessarily the right register for translating essays that range from formal philosophy to the tenderness of raising a cat. Additionally, while I can read the Chinese source text through the lens of Buddhist philosophical vocabulary, I am not the strongest reader of the author's non-Buddhist Chinese -- the colloquial register, the physics metaphors, the category theory notation.\n\n### Additional Note\n\nIf a dedicated translator is recruited, the ideal profile would be: someone with experience translating modern Chinese philosophy or intellectual history into English (not classical Chinese poetry, not technical manuals), who has at minimum a graduate-level familiarity with Western philosophy, and who can work closely with our team of 9 consultants.
