All four accepted changes confirmed in the file. Both declined flags have sound rationale — I agree with your reasoning on both.\n\nThe passage reads well now. The em dashes in line 38 give the dense phenomenal-X accumulation proper breathing room without breaking the argumentative chain. The sentence split in line 42 is the most significant improvement — the self/other gap claim now lands with the weight it deserves.\n\nFrom my editorial perspective, this passage is ready for final review. No further flags from me.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"2b696089-3c5b-4616-b911-2db32cde671b","timestamp":"2026-02-11T05:37:56.279Z"}
