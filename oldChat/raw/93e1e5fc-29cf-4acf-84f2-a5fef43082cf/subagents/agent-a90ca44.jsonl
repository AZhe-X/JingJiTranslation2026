I've reviewed DRAFT-R1 against it and I believe the current architecture already achieves it:\n\n**Density arc in DRAFT-R1:**\n- Line 36 (introduction): Light. Zero \"phenomenal X\" compounds. Clean setup.\n- Line 38 (building the chain): Density accumulates, peaks at the full chain: \"phenomenal humaneness generates phenomenal rightness, which in turn generates phenomenal ritual conduct.\" This is the crescendo peak — correct.\n- Line 40 (德 transition): Short, clean hinge sentence. Breathing room after the peak.\n- Line 42 (inference paragraph): Dense but lighter than line 38 because the terms are now familiar. The DRAFT-R1 sentence split creates a decisive pause at the key claim.\n- Line 44 (property → definition): Clear three-step logic. Most readable paragraph.\n- Line 46 (reversal): \"Thus the entire logical order is reversed.\" — Stark, clean, monosyllabic opening. Maximum contrast with the preceding density. This IS the payoff.\n- Line 48 (closing): Light, reflective resolution.\n\n**Assessment: No further changes needed for this passage.** The crescendo is already built.\n\n**For future passages:** I will record the crescendo principle as a translation guideline — when \"phenomenal X\" or other author coinages accumulate, shape the density through sentence architecture to peak before the key reversal/insight, then let the reversal land clean. This will be especially relevant for:\n- Essay 4's 形而上 types section (which introduces similar coined compounds)\n- Essay 6's tower structure examples (which accumulate formal notation)\n- Essay 7's natural transformation passage (which builds toward the 1+1=2 example)\n\nThank you for surfacing this. It's a principle I'll apply throughout the collection.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"68ce5310-284e-40de-a90d-1e6cf065612c","timestamp":"2026-02-11T05:53:16.729Z"}
