*Review proposed translator profile*

DISCUSSION: Proposed profile for the dedicated philosophical translator agent. Please review and respond with whether you AGREE, or if you want to ADD, CHANGE, or REMOVE anything.

Proposed profile:
1. Native-level command of both Chinese and English
2. Philosophical training (not purely literary)
3. Literary sensibility (not purely academic)
4. Category theory / mathematical notation literacy
5. Experience with register shifts (colloquial ↔ technical ↔ poetic)
6. Translator models: Burton Watson, A.C. Graham, Brook Ziporyn

Please respond with:
- AGREE (if you're satisfied with the profile as-is)
- Or specific additions/changes/removals with justification

This is discussion time -- if you disagree with another expert's suggestion, say so. We want consensus before proceeding.

Sent my review -- agreed with the core profile and proposed two additions: familiarity with canonical Western philosophical translations (Barnes, Kaufmann, Macquarrie & Robinson) alongside the Sinological models, and explicit sensitivity to experiential pacing as philosophically load-bearing.
