Here is why.**\n\n### The author IS describing a state of unknowing, and the Chinese IS pejorative\n\n沉醉 is not neutral in Chinese. 醉 (drunk) is not a compliment. 沉 (sunk/submerged) intensifies it: you are *deeply* drunk, sunk into intoxication. The author chose this word over neutral alternatives like 沉浸 (immersed), 投入 (engaged), or 专注 (absorbed). The choice of 醉 is deliberate and carries judgment: when you are 沉醉 in a dreamscape, you do not *know* it is a dreamscape. This is not morally neutral in the author's framework -- it is the condition that post-metaphysical poeticality explicitly *overcomes*.\n\nThe author's text makes the evaluative dimension clear: 沉醉的梦境 is aligned with 信念/信仰 (faith/belief) -- where purpose becomes \"logically groundless\" and the dreamscape becomes an \"unmoved mover.\" The author then says that after 祛魅 (disenchantment), we \"can no longer\" (无法再) be 沉醉. This is not describing a neutral state one might return to; it is describing a state that has been *surpassed* by lucidity. The asymmetry between 沉醉 and 清醒 is evaluative: 清醒 is presented as the appropriate post-metaphysical stance.\n\n### The Buddhist case for \"intoxicated\"\n\nIn Buddhist terminology, the closest parallel is *mada* (madness/intoxication) -- one of the secondary afflictions (upaklesha). The classic list includes \"intoxication with youth\" (yauvanamada), \"intoxication with health\" (arogyamada), and \"intoxication with life\" (jivitamada). These describe states where one is so absorbed in something that one loses awareness of its impermanent, constructed nature. This is *exactly* what 沉醉的梦境 describes: intoxication with a meaning-structure to the point of losing awareness that it is a construction.\n\nThe Diamond Sutra's dream metaphor presupposes that *most beings do not know they are dreaming*. The bodhisattva who practices while knowing phenomena are dreamlike has *woken up from* a state that is, in Buddhist terms, a form of intoxication (the intoxication of ignorance/avidya). The transition from 沉醉 to 清醒 maps onto the Buddhist transition from avidya to vidya (ignorance to knowledge), which IS evaluatively asymmetric.\n\n### Against \"absorbed\" and \"immersed\"\n\n**\"Absorbed\"** -- This is phenomenologically accurate (one is absorbed in the dreamscape) but evaluatively flat. Absorption can be positive (absorbed in a good book, absorbed in meditation). The author's 沉醉 is specifically NOT the kind of absorption one might choose to return to after achieving lucidity. \"Absorbed dreamscape\" sounds like a pleasant state; \"intoxicated dreamscape\" sounds like a state one has outgrown. The author means the latter.\n\n**\"Immersed\"** -- Same problem. \"Immersed\" is even more neutral than \"absorbed.\" We say \"immersed in study,\" \"immersed in culture\" -- all positive. And \"immersed\" captures 沉 (sunk/submerged) but entirely loses 醉 (drunk). Half the compound is translated; the other half is erased.\n\n### The \"impairment\" worry is overstated\n\nYes, \"intoxicated\" in English implies impairment. But the author IS describing impaired awareness -- impaired by the failure to recognize the dreamscape as a dreamscape. The impairment is *epistemic*, not *moral*. The author is not saying pre-metaphysical people are bad; they are saying pre-metaphysical people do not see what they are doing. This is exactly what \"intoxicated\" conveys: you are functioning, you may even be functioning well, but your *awareness of your situation* is impaired.\n\nConsider: \"He was intoxicated by the beauty of the music.\" This is not a moral condemnation. It describes a state of being *so taken by something that reflective awareness is suspended*. That is precisely 沉醉的梦境.\n\n### The pairing clinches it\n\nThe power of the author's distinction lies in the contrast: 沉醉 vs. 清醒. In English:\n- \"Intoxicated dreamscape\" vs. \"lucid dreamscape\" -- the contrast is vivid, immediate, and structurally clear. Intoxication is the opposite of lucidity. The pair works.\n- \"Absorbed dreamscape\" vs. \"lucid dreamscape\" -- the contrast is weak. Absorption is not the opposite of lucidity.\n- \"Immersed dreamscape\" vs. \"lucid dreamscape\" -- same problem. You can be immersed AND lucid (the author says so explicitly about 清醒的梦境: full engagement is required).\n\nOnly \"intoxicated\" creates the right contrastive pair with \"lucid.\" The two terms define each other by opposition, just as 沉醉 and 清醒 do in Chinese.\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":370,"cache_read_input_tokens":163779,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":370},"output_tokens":20,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY1M6ddSuifGZZMu5p8zV","type":"assistant","uuid":"7980dcf6-71ce-4c24-9783-a50956739afc","timestamp":"2026-02-11T00:38:17.221Z"}
