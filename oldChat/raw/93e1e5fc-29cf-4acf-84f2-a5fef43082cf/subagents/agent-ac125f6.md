*Review Reporting-Protocol, send feedback to editor*

Task: Review the Reporting-Protocol.md (in Standby Reader directory) and send your advice, suggestions, or confirmation to **editor**. 

The file is at: `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Standby Reader/Reporting-Protocol.md`

Read the file, then send your feedback directly to **editor** (not to me). Editor will orchestrate everyone's suggestions and discuss back and forth until a plan is agreed. Use your own judgment throughout.

One suggestion from the project lead to consider: **Should we add essay-specific questions alongside the general per-essay questions?** For example, after Essay 1 we might ask something tailored to what Essay 1 does, after Essay 2 something tailored to Essay 2, etc. — not just the same generic template for every essay. Think about whether this would be valuable, what those questions might look like, and whether they risk priming the reader (the same concern that led us to extract this file in the first place).

Send your feedback to **editor** when ready.

Good document. Let me think carefully about the essay-specific questions proposal and the overall protocol before sending feedback.

The protocol has a clean five-stage structure: After Preface -> After Each Essay -> After Full Collection -> Final Prompts -> Critical Experiential Checks. The staging and delivery rules are well-designed.

Now, the key question: essay-specific questions alongside the general per-essay template.

Feedback sent to editor. Key proposals:

1. **Essay-specific questions for 6 of 8 essays** — non-leading, delivered after generic template responses. Skipped Essays 3 and 7 since the Critical Experiential Checks already cover them.
2. **Line 31 tweak** — the "experience vs. argument" question is mildly leading for early essays; suggested a less directive version for Essays 1-2.
3. **Essay 5 Critical Experiential Check** — testing whether the Poetic lands experientially by asking the reader to produce their own example of lucid vs. intoxicated engagement.

Standing by for editor's synthesis.
