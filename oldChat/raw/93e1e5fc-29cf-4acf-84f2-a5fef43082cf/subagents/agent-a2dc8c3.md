*Vote: constitutive character → shortened to character*

The author proposes: introduce "constitutive character (德 De)" at first occurrence with a TN that explicitly tells the reader it will be shortened to "character" in the following paragraphs. Then use plain "character" throughout the rest of the text.

This gives:
- Precision at introduction (constitutive character)
- Lightweight running text (character)
- Reader is explicitly told about the shortening, so no confusion

YES or NO? Brief response.

Every occurrence of \"character\" will force them to disambiguate, which is the opposite of lightweight.\n\nIf we want something shorter for running text, \"constitutive character\" is already only two words. That's not heavy. Compare: \"transcendental apperception\" runs through hundreds of pages of Kant without anyone proposing we shorten it to \"apperception\" after the first mention. Philosophical terms earn their length.\n\nKeep \"constitutive character\" throughout. It's compact enough for running text and precise enough to do its job.",

Voted NO on shortening to plain "character." Too many competing meanings. "Constitutive character" is only two words — compact enough for running text while staying unambiguous.
