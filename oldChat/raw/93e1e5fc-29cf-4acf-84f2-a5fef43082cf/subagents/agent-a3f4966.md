*Confirming feedback already sent; summary of key points provided*

I already submitted my full feedback to you earlier in this session. To confirm you have it, here is a summary of my key points:

1. **No essay-specific questions during per-essay reporting** — the general template is sufficient and specificity at that stage would prime subsequent reading
2. **Add "what are you expecting?" after the Preface** — captures baseline expectations for contrast with post-reading experience
3. **Refine attention-flagging question** — ask "what was happening in the essay at that moment" to locate the source of disengagement
4. **Add Essay 5 to Critical Experiential Checks** — "The author distinguishes two ways of being in a dreamscape. What did you make of this distinction?" (non-leading probe for the lucid/intoxicated distinction)
5. **Consider adding Essay 1 to Critical Experiential Checks** — "After reading this essay, how do you think about the relationship between individuals and groups?" (tests whether the emergence/renormalization insight landed)
6. **Keep everything else as-is** — the staged delivery, non-leading language, and "tell a friend" sequence are all well-designed

Please let me know if my original detailed submission did not come through and I will resend it in full.
