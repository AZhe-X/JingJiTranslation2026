Currently the dictionary has:\n\n- 第〇实在 → Zeroth Reality\n- 第一实在 → First Reality  \n- 第二实在 → Second Reality\n\nThe author's proposal:\n\n- 第〇实在 → **Zeroth Reality** (with TN: \"Ultimate Reality\")\n- 第一实在 → **Ultimate Reality** (with TN: \"First Reality\" in the original)\n- 第二实在 → **Secondary Reality** (with TN: \"Second Reality\" in the original)\n\nSo the proposal promotes 第一实在 from \"First\" to \"Ultimate\" and demotes 第二实在 from \"Second\" to \"Secondary.\" 第〇实在 keeps \"Zeroth\" but gets a TN linking it to \"Ultimate Reality\" in traditional metaphysics.\n\nIs this a good idea? Does renaming 第一实在 as \"Ultimate Reality\" better capture its role (phenomena as the indubitable ground)? Or does it create confusion — since the author explicitly says (footnote 25) that 第一实在 is a *name* (名称), not an ontological claim about what is \"most real\"? And does calling 第二实在 \"Secondary\" imply it is lesser/derivative in a way the author may not intend?\n\nKeep your response concise — yes/no with brief reasoning.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"0503e4be-1eae-4a78-ac15-e7aef8cfc976","timestamp":"2026-02-10T23:27:37.398Z"}
