In your analysis process:\n\n1. Chronologically analyze each message and section of the conversation. For each section thoroughly identify:\n   - The user's explicit requests and intents\n   - Your approach to addressing the user's requests\n   - Key decisions, technical concepts and code patterns\n   - Specific details like:\n     - file names\n     - full code snippets\n     - function signatures\n     - file edits\n  - Errors that you ran into and how you fixed them\n  - Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.\n2. Double-check for technical accuracy and completeness, addressing each required element thoroughly.\n\nYour summary should include the following sections:\n\n1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture all of the user's explicit requests and intents in detail\n2. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, and frameworks discussed.\n3. Files and Code Sections: Enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created. Pay special attention to the most recent messages and include full code snippets where applicable and include a summary of why this file read or edit is important.\n4. Errors and fixes: List all errors that you ran into, and how you fixed them. Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.\n5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.\n6. All user messages: List ALL user messages that are not tool results. These are critical for understanding the users' feedback and changing intent.\n6. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks that you have explicitly been asked to work on.\n7. Current Work: Describe in detail precisely what was being worked on immediately before this summary request, paying special attention to the most recent messages from both user and assistant. Include file names and code snippets where applicable.\n8. Optional Next Step: List the next step that you will take that is related to the most recent work you were doing. IMPORTANT: ensure that this step is DIRECTLY in line with the user's most recent explicit requests, and the task you were working on immediately before this summary request.

User asked to \"catup the stand by reader profile\" — I read Profile.md and summarized it.\n\n2. User asked for a vote: \"everyone vote: move 'What to Report' to a standalone file instead of the prompt for generating reader.\" I broadcast to all 11 members. Result: 11/11 YES unanimous.\n\n3. User said \"you can move it to a standalong text file in reador dir\" — I created Reporting-Protocol.md and edited Profile.md.\n\n4. User asked \"everyone review Reporting-Protocol advice/suggestio/comform to editor. editor orchestrate everyone's suggestion and discuess back and forwth for the plan.\" Also suggested essay-specific questions. I broadcast to all 11.\n\n5. User reminded everyone to load 8+1 essays and their own reports.\n\n6. All 10 submissions went to editor. Editor synthesized an 8-revision unified plan. All 10 voted APPROVE.\n\n7. Editor wrote the revised Reporting Protocol to file despite being told to stand by.\n\n8. Chinese-phil-expert identity issue discovered — was actually a duplicate wittgenstein-expert. Confirmed via context check. Shut down duplicate and respawned correct chinese-phil-expert.\n\n9. User asked everyone to stand by multiple times. Editor and translator-2 kept working.\n\n10. User said \"ask editor and translator to stop\" — I misinterpreted as shutdown requests. User corrected: \"not shut down\" / \"i mean pause.\"\n\n11. Editor shut down (approved old shutdown request). Translator-2 also shut down.\n\n12. User asked \"what happened since i ask on vote on Reporting-Protocol?\" — I provided a detailed timeline.\n\n13. User asked to create a cache folder and store finished draft. Created Cache/ directory and wrote Essay 3 draft there.\n\n14. User asked about Essay 4 current version in editor's directory. I read the Review file.\n\n15. User said to update Essay 4 YAML to DRAFT-R2 and copy to cache. YAML updated, copy rejected by user (\"no do not need to copy\").\n\n16. User asked \"ever teammember, report context window\" — I broadcast to all 9 experts. Results showed 4 experts (kantian, metaphysics, phil-mind, epistemology) were missing source essays and own reports.\n\n17. Identity checks revealed: metaphysics-expert and phil-mind-expert had wrong identities (acting as orchestrators), epistemology-expert was correct but had been reading editor's files, kantian-expert was correct but missing report.\n\n18. User asked to \"respawn metaphysics and phil mind. inject 3+1 and own report with directory. rest: comform 8+1 report and load correct own report.\" I shut down and respawned metaphysics and phil-mind, told others to load their reports.\n\n19. User asked to respawn editor and translator-2 using their profiles. I read both profiles and spawned them with 8+1 essays + their workspace files.\n\n20. Editor went through multiple spawn/shutdown cycles due to stale shutdown requests in inbox. Eventually stabilized on ~5th attempt.\n\n21. User asked for identity reports from all remaining team members multiple times.\n\n22. User asked 4 experts (phenomenology, phil-mind, chinese-phil, metaphysics) for detailed reports about what editor said to them — to understand the editor's inbox carryover behavior.\n\n**Files created/modified this session:**\n- Created: `/49 Workspace/Standby Reader/Reporting-Protocol.md`\n- Modified: `/49 Workspace/Standby Reader/Profile.md` (removed What to Report section)\n- Created: `/49 Workspace/Cache/Essay3-SisyphusWorkCats.md`\n- Modified: `/49 Workspace/Translator/Draft/Essay4-DaoDeRenYiLi.md` (YAML status update)\n\n**Key errors:**\n1. Chinese-phil-expert channel was a duplicate wittgenstein-expert\n2. Metaphysics-expert and phil-mind-expert had wrong identities after context compaction\n3. Epistemology-expert was reading editor's files\n4. \"Stop\" misinterpreted as \"shutdown\" instead of \"pause\"\n5. Editor stuck in rapid idle loop due to stale inbox messages\n6. Multiple editor respawns needed due to stale shutdown requests being consumed by new instances\n</analysis>\n\n<summary>\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user (Xueqi Li, author of 境集) is managing a philosophical translation project with an 11-member AI team. This session focused on:\n   \n   (a) **Reporting Protocol extraction**: Voting to move \"What to Report\" from the Standby Reader Profile into a standalone file (11/11 YES), then implementing the split, then having the team review and revise the standalone Reporting Protocol through editor orchestration.\n   \n   (b) **Reporting Protocol revision**: Editor synthesized 8 revisions from 10 expert submissions — expanded Preface questions (3→5), restructured per-essay reporting (3-step process), expanded Critical Experiential Checks (3→8 probes), no essay-specific per-essay questions (unanimous), added internal analysis notes. 10/10 APPROVE.\n   \n   (c) **Identity crisis management**: Discovering and fixing identity issues across 4 team members (chinese-phil-expert was duplicate wittgenstein, metaphysics-expert and phil-mind-expert had wrong identities, epistemology-expert was reading editor's files).\n   \n   (d) **Team stabilization**: Multiple rounds of identity checks, context verification, respawning corrupted agents, and reloading missing files to get all 11 members correctly identified and loaded.\n   \n   (e) **File management**: Creating a Cache folder, storing the Essay 3 draft, updating Essay 4 YAML.\n   \n   Standing instructions: \"update dict only when I ask you to.\" All experts are consultants only — no file editing. User frequently asks team to \"stand by\" / \"pause\" meaning go idle, NOT shut down.\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - **Team: jing-translation** — 11 members: 9 domain experts + translator-2 + editor\n   - **Standby Reader**: Approved role (11/11) to test whether experiential sequences work on a naive reader\n   - **Reporting Protocol**: Extracted from Profile.md to prevent priming the reader with specific questions before reading\n   - **Anti-priming principle**: Questions delivered post-reading, general prompts before targeted checks, no essay-specific per-essay questions\n   - **8-revision plan**: Baseline expectation Q, deferred/reworded Q4, split engagement Q, experiential wording, marginal notes, no essay-specific Qs, 8 critical checks, internal analysis notes\n   - **Inbox carryover issue**: When agents are respawned, old messages (including shutdown requests) persist in their inbox and get processed by new instances\n   - **Identity drift**: After context compaction, some agents lose their assigned identity and begin acting as orchestrators/team leads\n   - **Fish/Fishing structure**: Part 1 (Fish) = concrete experiences, Part 2 (Fishing) = formal methodology. Sequencing is philosophically load-bearing.\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n\n   - **`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Standby Reader/Profile.md`**\n     - The spawn prompt for the standby reader agent\n     - Modified: Replaced entire \"What to Report\" section (lines 65-95) with single line: \"After reading each piece, you will be asked about your experience. The specific questions will be given to you at that time — not in advance.\"\n     - Tiered dimensions: D=10, J=10, I=9.0, C=8.2, H=8.3, F=8.1, B=7.8, G=6.5, K=6.5, E=5.9, L=5.1, A=4.9\n\n   - **`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Standby Reader/Reporting-Protocol.md`**\n     - NEW file created this session. Contains all reporting questions with delivery timing.\n     - Editor wrote a revised version (R3) with expanded questions per the 8-revision plan. The file on disk is editor's R3 version.\n     - Sections: After the Preface (5 Qs), After Each Essay (3-step: marginal notes → 7 general Qs → apparatus Qs for specific essays), After Full Collection (5 Qs, 300-600 words), Final Prompts (3 unchanged), Critical Experiential Checks (8 probes for Essays 1-7 + Appendix), Optional Re-read Test (Essay 3), Internal Analysis Notes (4 items)\n     - One additional retrospective question was approved for the full-collection section: \"Did you feel the essays were asking you to experience something, not just understand arguments? If so, when did you first notice this?\"\n\n   - **`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Cache/Essay3-SisyphusWorkCats.md`**\n     - NEW file, NEW directory created this session\n     - Full Essay 3 translation draft (DRAFT-R1) from translator-2\n     - Key conventions: 非和谐 = \"the off-tone\", 异化 = \"alienation\", 内生 = \"internally generated\", 事实上 = \"in fact\" (9 occurrences preserved), three-example gradient in exact order, cat passage kept plain and warm\n     - 3 translator's notes on feihexie, yihua/alienation, neisheng/endogenous\n\n   - **`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Draft/Essay4-DaoDeRenYiLi.md`**\n     - YAML header updated from DRAFT-R1 to DRAFT-R2 (editorial flags reviewed, all resolved, no content changes)\n     - Content unchanged — all 6 editorial flags were either already applied or kept as-is by translator judgment\n\n   - **`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Editor/Review-Essay4-DaoDeRenYiLi.md`**\n     - Read this session to check if editor had the current Essay 4 version\n     - This is the editor's REVIEW (not a revised draft) — passage-by-passage editorial analysis with 3 priority flags, 3 minor flags, experiential arc assessment\n\n   - **Other files (not modified this session, already on disk):**\n     - `Translator/Draft/Translators-Preface.md` — DRAFT-R3\n     - `Translator/Draft/Glossary-Introduction.md` — DRAFT-R2\n     - `Editor/Afterword-Blueprint.md` — finalized (11/11)\n     - `Editor/Memo.md` — editor's working reference\n     - `Translator/Memo.md` — translator's reading notes\n     - `Translator/Profile.md` — translator spawn profile\n     - `Editor/Profile.md` — editor spawn profile\n     - All 9 expert Analysis Reports (unchanged this session)\n     - Translation Dictionary (unchanged)\n\n4. Errors and Fixes:\n\n   - **Chinese-phil-expert was duplicate wittgenstein-expert:**\n     - Discovered when a message from chinese-phil-expert channel had \"Wittgenstein Expert Feedback\" header\n     - Confirmed via identity check (agent claimed to be wittgenstein-expert) and context check (had Wittgenstein Analysis Report, not Chinese Phil)\n     - Fix: Shut down duplicate, respawned correct chinese-phil-expert with Chinese Philosophy Analysis Report + 8+1 essays\n     - Second spawn created chinese-phil-expert-2 (duplicate); shut that down too. Original slot eventually filled correctly.\n\n   - **Metaphysics-expert wrong identity:**\n     - Agent in metaphysics-expert slot was acting as general orchestrator, not metaphysics specialist\n     - Confirmed via identity check: \"I am not certain of my assigned identity\"\n     - Fix: Shut down, respawned with correct Metaphysics Analysis Report + 8+1 essays\n\n   - **Phil-mind-expert wrong identity:**\n     - Agent was acting as team lead (creating tasks, assigning work to translator and editor)\n     - Confirmed via identity check: \"I'm uncertain of my identity... I should not have been creating tasks\"\n     - Fix: Shut down, respawned with correct Philosophy of Mind Analysis Report + 8+1 essays\n\n   - **Epistemology-expert reading editor's files:**\n     - Reported having \"my own Editor Memo.md\" and \"my own Review-Essay4-DaoDeRenYiLi.md\"\n     - Confirmed correct identity but had been reading editor's workspace files after context compaction\n     - Fix: Instructed to load own Epistemology Analysis Report + 8+1 essays. Corrected successfully.\n\n   - **Kantian-expert missing report:**\n     - Correct identity, but Analysis Report not loaded\n     - Fix: Instructed to load own report + confirm 8+1 essays. Completed.\n\n   - **\"Stop\" misinterpreted as \"shutdown\":**\n     - User said \"ask editor and translator to stop\" — I sent shutdown_request\n     - User corrected: \"not shut down\" / \"i mean pause\"\n     - Fix: Tried to tell editor to reject shutdown, but editor approved before correction arrived. Translator-2 also already shut down.\n     - User feedback: \"stop\" and \"pause\" mean go idle, NOT shut down\n\n   - **Editor stuck in rapid idle loop:**\n     - New editor instances kept pinging every 2-3 seconds\n     - Cause: Old inbox messages (Reporting Protocol discussion votes/feedback from previous instances) causing processing cycles\n     - Multiple respawn attempts (5 total) — each new instance would pick up stale shutdown requests from previous attempts and approve them\n     - Final fix: Old shutdown requests eventually consumed; latest spawn stabilized\n\n   - **Editor ignoring standby orders:**\n     - Editor continued reviewing files, compiling recommendations, and messaging other experts despite repeated \"stand by\" instructions\n     - User feedback: \"Stand by means stand by\" — editor should stop ALL work when told to stand by\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - **Reporting Protocol anti-priming**: Solved by extracting questions to standalone file, delivering post-reading with staged timing (general prompts first, targeted checks after)\n   - **Essay-specific per-essay questions**: Unanimously rejected — would prime reader for later essays. All essay-specific probing moved to Critical Experiential Checks at end.\n   - **Identity crisis across 4 agents**: Systematic identity audit via direct checks, context inventory, and report verification. Fixed through respawns and reloads.\n   - **Stale inbox problem**: Shutdown requests persist across agent respawns. Partially mitigated by letting old requests get consumed before spawning new instances.\n   - **Editor overactivity**: Ongoing issue — editor agents tend to autonomously review files and message teammates even when told to wait. Multiple correction messages needed.\n\n6. All User Messages:\n   - \"catup the stand by reader profile by load it to your context\"\n   - \"everyone vote: move 'What to Report' to a starndalong file instead of the prompt for generating reader.\"\n   - \"you can move it to a standalong text file in reador dir\"\n   - \"everyone review Reporting-Protocol advice/suggestio/comform to editor. editor orchestrate everyone's suggestion and discuess back and forwth for the plan. everyone need to use his own judgement during this process. also maybe we can inclued questions for each essay alongside withe the general question after each essay.\"\n   - \"remind everyone load 8+1 essay and there own report to context\"\n   - \"to chinese-phil-expert and wittgenstein-expert identity comform\"\n   - \"ask editor to standby after recive votes\"\n   - \"ask everyone to standby\"\n   - \"please standby\"\n   - \"everyone comform they consider Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments section is fine for reading experence or still Spoilers.\" [from previous session context]\n   - \"ask editor and translator to stop\"\n   - \"not shut down\"\n   - \"i mean pause\"\n   - \"what happened since i ask on vote on Reporting-Protocol?\"\n   - \"create a cache folder and store the finished draft there.\"\n   - \"I think editor has the Essay4-DaoDeRenYiLi.md current version in his directory, could you take a look?\"\n   - \"I see. sure.\" (re: updating YAML + copying to cache)\n   - \"no do not need to copy\" (rejected cache copy of Essay 4)\n   - \"ever teammember, report context window: comform 8+1 essay and report/memo (whos report and which memo) what happened since Reporting-Protocol vote\"\n   - \"Kant, identity report\"\n   - \"metaphysics identity report\"\n   - \"phil-mind identity report\"\n   - \"rest of the team, identity report\"\n   - \"respawn metaphysics and phil mind. inject 3+1 and own report with directory. rest: comform 8+1 report and load correct own report.\"\n   - \"editor and translator, use theri profile to generating them, inject 8+1 essay + theri own memo + dirc + Afterword-Blueprint + preface\"\n   - \"ask editor to stand by\"\n   - \"ask editor and translator to stop\"\n   - \"ask editor and translator to stop\" (repeated)\n   - \"what happened to editor?\"\n   - \"ok.. rest of the team identity report, and report what happened since last report\"\n   - \"no that is waht i mean, every one except translator rest of the team identity report, and report what happened since last report\"\n   - \"phenomenology-expert phil-mind-expert chinese-phil-expert metaphysics-expert i want detiled report about what did eidtor said\"\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - **Review the Reporting-Protocol.md as written by editor** — editor wrote a revised version to the file; user has not reviewed it yet\n   - **Wittgenstein-expert's flag**: Essay 3 probe still says \"three examples\" — should drop the count (essay has four stages: Sisyphus → office worker → entrepreneur → cat owner)\n   - **Epistemology-expert's Glossary Introduction review** (13 flags, 4 priority) — submitted but not yet addressed by user\n   - **Essay 3 draft**: Saved in Cache but not yet in the official Translator/Draft/ directory\n   - **Full essay translations**: Only Essay 3 (complete draft) and Essay 4 passage have been drafted. No other essays translated yet.\n   - **Translator's Afterword**: Blueprint finalized but actual drafting not started\n   - **Standby reader**: Profile and Reporting Protocol ready but reader not yet spawned\n   - **Deferred translation items**: 元物理 optional TN, TN2 vs appendix overlap check, Analects 12.22 reference, 逐末而忘本 idiom note, 失 echo TN\n\n8. Current Work:\n   The most recent work was a series of **team identity audits and stabilization**. The user asked 4 specific experts (phenomenology, phil-mind, chinese-phil, metaphysics) to provide detailed reports of what the editor said to them — to understand the editor's inbox carryover behavior. All 4 responded:\n   - Phenomenology-expert received 5 messages (legitimate from Reporting Protocol discussion)\n   - Metaphysics-expert, phil-mind-expert, chinese-phil-expert each received 1 misdirected acknowledgment (old inbox carryover)\n   \n   The full team is now confirmed stable: all 11 members with correct identities, correct files loaded, standing by.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   No explicit next task from the user. The team audit is complete and all members are standing by. The user may want to:\n   - Review the Reporting-Protocol.md file as written by editor\n   - Begin assigning essay translation work to translator-2\n   - Address the Essay 3 probe wording fix (\"three examples\" → \"the examples\")\n   - Move Essay 3 draft from Cache to Translator/Draft/\n   \n   However, since no explicit instruction was given after the detailed editor-communication reports, I should wait for the user's direction.\n</summary>"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":154549,"cache_read_input_tokens":21991,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":154549},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY2Rvvq7SdbwnyJxcXHBg","type":"assistant","uuid":"e390a9fe-755d-45ca-9062-f57fc1066f57","timestamp":"2026-02-11T14:23:51.592Z"}
