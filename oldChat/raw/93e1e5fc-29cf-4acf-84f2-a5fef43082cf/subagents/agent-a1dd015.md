*2 suggestions already in draft, 1 declined — no changes needed*

Thank you for the thorough review. Here is the status of your 3 main suggestions:

1. **Hyphenated "*meta-physics*" for 元物理** — Already in the draft. Line 36 reads: `the most "primordial" *meta-physics* (元物理)`. This was done in an earlier pass.

2. **"(德)" after "character" at first analysis appearance** — Already in the draft. Line 40 reads: `and call it "character" (德).[^TN3]`. The callback is present.

3. **Scare quotes on "generates"** — Not adopting. The original 道生万物 has no scare quotes or emphasis on 生. The author's rhetorical strategy is to present the conventional view *straight* and then deconstruct it — the reader needs to first accept the top-down picture before the reversal hits. Scare-quoting would editorially front-load the deconstruction. The later italicized "*generated*" in the same sentence already marks the emphasis at the right moment.

Your confirmations on the constructivist inversion, TN3, TN4, and the phenomenal-X consistency are all helpful validation. The "righteousness" point is noted and deferred per the team vote.

No changes needed from your review — the draft already incorporates your first two suggestions.

Review complete. The draft already had the key improvements I suggested, and the one remaining suggestion (scare quotes on "generates") was correctly declined. Waiting for further instructions from the team lead.
