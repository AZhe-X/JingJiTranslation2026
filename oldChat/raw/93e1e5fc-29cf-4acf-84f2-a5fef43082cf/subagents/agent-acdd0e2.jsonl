The essays are written by a Chinese author drawing heavily on Chinese philosophical vocabulary (道/德/仁/义/礼, 境, 诗意), and the translator needs to feel the weight of these terms in their source language.\n\n**Why phenomenology-expert as third choice:** The phenomenological register dominates the most philosophically dense essays (后形而上学, 诗意, 范畴论与境). Phenomenological writing in English has established conventions (from translations of Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty) that the translator should be comfortable with.\n\n**Self-recommendation:** I rank myself fourth. I can write strong philosophical prose in the existentialist register, and my analysis of the essays is thorough. However, my strength is *analysis*, not *translation*.
