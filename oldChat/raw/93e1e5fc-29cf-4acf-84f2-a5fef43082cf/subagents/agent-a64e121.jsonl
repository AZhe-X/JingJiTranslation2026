We decided to use standard translations in the block quote (Option B). But there's a tension:\n\nOur dictionary has:\n- 仁 → \"humaneness\" (main), \"benevolence\" (alternative)\n- 义 → \"rightness\" (main), \"righteousness\" (alternative)  \n- 礼 → \"ritual conduct\" (main), \"ritual\" / \"propriety\" (alternatives)\n\nStandard academic translations of the Laozi Ch. 38 passage use:\n- 仁 → \"benevolence\" (Lau, Ivanhoe), \"humanity\" (Chan)\n- 义 → \"rectitude\" (Lau), \"righteousness\" (Chan, Ivanhoe)\n- 礼 → \"rites\" (Lau), \"propriety\" (Chan), \"ritual\" (Ivanhoe)\n\nFor the Laozi block quote specifically, should we:\nA) Use standard Laozi translations (benevolence, righteousness, rites/ritual) — then switch to our terms (humaneness, rightness, ritual conduct) in the author's analysis\nB) Use our dictionary terms throughout (humaneness, rightness, ritual conduct) — even in the block quote\nC) Something else?\n\nNote: we already decided \"virtue\" in the block quote → \"(constitutive) character\" in the analysis for 德. The question is whether that same split applies to 仁/义/礼 too.\n\nBrief response.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"64534c13-ff9b-460b-9aaf-adb00764a1e2","timestamp":"2026-02-11T02:09:41.191Z"}
