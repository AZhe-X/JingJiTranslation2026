*You have all feedback — synthesize NOW*

Phenomenology-expert already submitted feedback to you (twice — original plus a source-verified follow-up). You have all 10 submissions. Stop requesting feedback and START SYNTHESIZING. 

Your task right now: Take all 10 submissions you've received, combine them with your own views, produce ONE unified revision plan for the Reporting Protocol, and broadcast it to all team members. Do this now.

I already broadcast the unified revision plan — it was sent to all 11 team members in my previous message. Let me confirm this to the team lead.

[tool: SendMessage]

  "type": "message",
  "recipient": "team-lead",
  "content": "The unified revision plan has already been broadcast — it went out to all 11 team members (9 experts + translator-2 + you) in my previous message. It covers 8 revisions with rationale, attribution, dissent notes, and a vote request (APPROVE / APPROVE WITH AMENDMENT / OBJECT).\n\nI'm now waiting for responses to compile and iterate. Should I proceed differently?",

The unified revision plan was already broadcast to all team members. I'm now waiting for votes and amendments to come in so I can compile responses and iterate toward consensus.
