*Two optional follow-ups: intersubjectivity via η, essays as philosophical experiments*

Two follow-up items from the author for you to consider. These are optional — only engage if you find them relevant to your field. If not, you can skip.

1. **Intersubjectivity (主体间性)**: If you have open questions about how intersubjectivity works in this framework, the author suggests looking at the natural transformation (自然变换) section in K1策略. The natural transformation η may be the mechanism through which intersubjective verification is possible — if two people share the same structural alignment (same η), their understanding is commensurable even without sharing qualia. Consider whether this resolves or reframes the intersubjectivity problem from your field's perspective.

2. **Philosophical Experiment (哲学实验)**: The author proposes "philosophical experiments" — constructing examples to awaken specific experiences in readers, then checking if those experiences are replicable. The author suggests that many parts of the essays THEMSELVES are philosophical experiments (not just descriptions of philosophy, but actual experiments being conducted on the reader). Re-read the essays with this lens: which specific passages function as philosophical experiments? Is the Sisyphus/cat essay itself an experiment in dissolving absurdity? Is the 道德仁义礼 reversal an experiment in restructuring the reader's 境?

If you have thoughts on either of these, please share. If not, no need to respond.

These are both directly relevant to epistemology. Let me think through them carefully before responding.

The intersubjectivity question via natural transformation is central to epistemology -- the problem of how knowledge can be shared, verified, and communicated between subjects is one of the field's core concerns. And the "philosophical experiment" concept touches on epistemological methodology -- what counts as evidence or verification for philosophical claims.

I've sent my detailed analysis of both follow-up items. Key contributions:

1. **Intersubjectivity via eta**: I argued this is an original epistemological resolution -- two subjects can verify mutual understanding by sharing structural alignment patterns (eta) without needing to compare qualia or access objective truth. The naturality condition is crucial: it requires *systematic* alignment, not accidental agreement. Connected this to Sellars's "space of reasons."

2. **Essays as philosophical experiments**: I identified four specific essays functioning as experiments:
   - "A Thought on Knowledge": the three Bob examples as progressive epistemic destabilization
   - "西西弗斯、班与猫": the Sisyphus-to-cat progression as an experiment in dissolving absurdity experientially
   - "后形而上学 整理": the 道德仁义礼 reversal as a Necker-cube-like structural inversion experiment
   - "形而上学后的目的：诗意": the RPG game example as an experiment in recognizing pre-existing poetic engagement

I also proposed the term **"structural phenomenological induction"** for this new form of epistemic justification, which I believe fills a genuine gap in the epistemological literature.

Standing by for any further questions from the team lead.
