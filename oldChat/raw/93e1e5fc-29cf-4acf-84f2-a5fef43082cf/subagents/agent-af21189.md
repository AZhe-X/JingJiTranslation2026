Quick check: for 道 in the Laozi block quote, do we use "the Way" (Ivanhoe/Lau/Chan standard) or "Dao" (romanized)?

Note: in the author's own analysis, we may use "Dao" as a romanized term. The question is specifically about the block quote.

YES = "the Way" in the block quote
NO = something else (say what)

One word answer.

**YES** -- "the Way" for 道 in the Laozi block quote. Standard, recognizable, and follows the same logic as "virtue" for 德 in the block quote.
