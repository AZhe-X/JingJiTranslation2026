It includes: (1) essay-specific follow-up proposals for all 8 essays + Appendix, (2) a Preface retrospective question, (3) an Essay 5 experiential check for the Poetic/lucid dreamscape, (4) recommendation to skip Essay 3 follow-up to avoid double-probing, (5) word count instead of page count. Let me know if you need me to resend or clarify anything.",
