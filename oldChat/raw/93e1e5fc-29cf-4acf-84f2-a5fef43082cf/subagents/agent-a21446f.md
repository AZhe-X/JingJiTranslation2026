*Vote on Option B — terminology to glossary*

Quick vote needed: Do you agree with the editor's Option B — move the Key Terminological Decisions section (~800 words) from the Translator's Preface to a glossary introduction? The Preface would keep: title, author, structure, bilingual, 形 reinterpretation, experiential sequences, reading advice. Brief response — agree/disagree + one-sentence reason.

The team lead is now asking me directly to vote on Option B. Let me respond with my position.

  "type": "message",
  "recipient": "team-lead",
  "content": "**Agree with Option B.** The terminology section has grown to 1,650 words (not 800) and belongs adjacent to the glossary where readers will actually consult it -- a Preface should orient the reader toward the text, not serve as a reference document.",
  "summary": "Agree Option B — terminology to glossary"
}
