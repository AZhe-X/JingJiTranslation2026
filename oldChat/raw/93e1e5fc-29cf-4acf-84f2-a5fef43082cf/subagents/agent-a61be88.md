*Debate: intoxicated vs absorbed vs immersed for 沉醉*

The author wants a focused debate on the translation of 沉醉 / 沉醉的梦境:

Current split:
- **"intoxicated"** (metaphysics, existentialism, chinese-phil, buddhism) — preserves the Chinese metaphor (沉=sink, 醉=drunk), Buddhist resonance (mada, clouded awareness)
- **"absorbed"** (phenomenology) — more neutral, closer to Heidegger's Verfallen
- **"immersed"** (wittgenstein, phil-mind) — neutral, captures the "sunk-in" quality without pejorative connotation

The key tension: "intoxicated" is faithful to the source metaphor but carries negative connotations in English (implies impairment, poor judgment). "Absorbed" and "immersed" are neutral but lose the 醉 (drunk) component.

Please debate this among yourselves. Make your case, respond to the other positions, and see if you can reach consensus. Is the pejorative connotation of "intoxicated" a feature (the author IS describing a state of unknowing) or a bug (the author is not morally condemning pre-metaphysical existence)?

Revised my position and now support **"intoxicated"** over my earlier "absorbed." The key argument: "intoxicated" and "lucid" form natural opposites along the axis of cognitive clarity, which is exactly the contrast the author draws between 沉醉的梦境 and 清醒的梦境. "Absorbed" and "immersed" are both too neutral -- they are compatible with full awareness, whereas intoxication inherently implies clouded perception. The pejorative connotation is a feature (epistemic deficiency the author wants you to move beyond), not a moral judgment, and a footnote can clarify this. Standing by.
