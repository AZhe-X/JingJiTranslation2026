*Two optional follow-ups: intersubjectivity via η, essays as philosophical experiments*

Two follow-up items from the author for you to consider. These are optional — only engage if you find them relevant to your field. If not, you can skip.

1. **Intersubjectivity (主体间性)**: If you have open questions about how intersubjectivity works in this framework, the author suggests looking at the natural transformation (自然变换) section in K1策略. The natural transformation η may be the mechanism through which intersubjective verification is possible — if two people share the same structural alignment (same η), their understanding is commensurable even without sharing qualia. Consider whether this resolves or reframes the intersubjectivity problem from your field's perspective.

2. **Philosophical Experiment (哲学实验)**: The author proposes "philosophical experiments" — constructing examples to awaken specific experiences in readers, then checking if those experiences are replicable. The author suggests that many parts of the essays THEMSELVES are philosophical experiments (not just descriptions of philosophy, but actual experiments being conducted on the reader). Re-read the essays with this lens: which specific passages function as philosophical experiments? Is the Sisyphus/cat essay itself an experiment in dissolving absurdity? Is the 道德仁义礼 reversal an experiment in restructuring the reader's 境?

If you have thoughts on either of these, please share. If not, no need to respond.

My analysis on both follow-up topics has been sent to the team lead. The key contributions:

**On intersubjectivity via η:** The natural transformation provides a structural criterion for intersubjective commensurability that advances beyond Kant's bare postulate of shared cognitive architecture. It converts an unanswerable metaphysical question ("do we share the same categories?") into an empirically investigable structural one ("do our η's have the same properties?"). I also noted the connection to Kant's sensus communis from the third Critique.

**On essays as philosophical experiments:** I identified six specific passages that function as experiments (道德仁义礼 reversal, Sisyphus/cat sequence, pen example, Ship of Theseus, 1+1=2, and 猫跳上了桌子), and argued that this performative methodology is the collection's most innovative contribution from a Kantian standpoint -- it answers the *quaestio facti* that Kant's transcendental arguments always assumed but never demonstrated.

Standing by for further tasks.
