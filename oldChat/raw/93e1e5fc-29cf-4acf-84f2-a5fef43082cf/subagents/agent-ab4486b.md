*Weight profile dimensions + vote on *

**Two items for the standby reader profile:**

**Item 1: Weight each profile dimension by significance (out of 10).**

Score each dimension from 1-10 for how important it is to getting the right standby reader:

- A. Education level (graduate-level humanities)
- B. No philosophy specialization
- C. No category theory / formal math
- D. No prior exposure to these essays or our materials
- E. Basic cultural literacy (Sisyphus, metaphysics, Laozi)
- F. Comfort with abstract ideas and sustained argument
- G. Tolerance for foreign terms and mathematical notation on page
- H. Curious and patient disposition
- I. Honest about confusion / not deferential
- J. **Experientially attentive** — notices what happens to them while reading
- K. Life experience (has worked a job, owned a pet, faced decisions)
- L. Reads literary fiction / attentive to prose quality

**Item 2: Vote on "Tell a friend what this is about" as a final prompt.**

The editor proposed asking the standby reader, after completing the full collection: "What would you tell a friend this collection is about?"

Vote: **YES** (keep this prompt) or **NO** (suggest a different/better final prompt).

Over-educated readers may over-intellectualize rather than experience.\n- B. No philosophy specialization: **8** — Critical. A philosophy specialist will pattern-match to existing frameworks rather than undergo the experiments fresh. This is the main thing we are testing.\n- C. No category theory / formal math: **9** — Near-essential. If they already know what a natural transformation is, the Essay 7 passage about eta cannot function as a philosophical experiment for them. We need to test whether the examples carry the content independently.\n-
