The term derives from the *Yijing* 易经 phrase \"形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器\" (what is above form is called Dao, what is below form is called vessels/instruments). However, the author explicitly reinterprets this: in the author's framework, 现象 (phenomena) constitute the foundational level, not the generated level, thus inverting the traditional top-down cosmology. The translation must preserve the distinction between metaphysics as a discipline and the metaphysical as content. Confusion with Western \"metaphysics\" (which blurs this distinction) is a major translation danger.\n     9→\n    10→## 形而上\n    11→- **Main translation**: the metaphysical (as adjective/noun); metaphysical construct\n    12→- **Alternatives**:\n    13→  - \"metaphysical understanding\" when emphasizing interpretation\n    14→  - \"metaphysical framework\" when referring to systematic constructs\n    15→  - \"metaphysical object\" in technical category-theoretic contexts (as in \"metaphysics object of the third kind\")\n    16→- **Note**: This refers not to the discipline but to the content—the interpretive structures we build upon phenomena. The author states: \"形而上 is a kind of understanding/interpretation of phenomena.\" It is generated from below (from 现象) but appears in our explanatory schemes as if it were generating from above. This is the core of the author's critique of pre-metaphysics: the logical inversion that buries the genetic order. Do not translate as \"metaphysics\" (which would conflate it with the discipline). The term carries the connotation of \"what lies above/beyond form\" but in the author's system this \"above\" is functional and epistemic, not ontological.\n    17→\n    18→## 后形而上学\n    19→- **Main translation**: post-metaphysics\n    20→- **Alternatives**:\n    21→  - \"post-metaphysical thinking\" (echoing Habermas)\n    22→  - \"metaphysics after nihilism\"\n    23→- **Note**: This is not \"after and done with\" metaphysics but \"after and transformed.\" The author defines it as metaphysics that: (1) takes phenomena as center, (2) acknowledges all 形而上 as constructions upon phenomena, (3) acknowledges non-rationality, (4) has a functional character centered on practice (实践) as the overlap of ideal and phenomenon. The parallel to Habermas's nachmetaphysisches Denken is strong but not exact—the author centers individual phenomenal experience rather than intersubjective discourse. The \"post\" signifies awareness of the disenchantment of 第〇实在 (ultimate reality) following nihilism, not a rejection of metaphysical thinking per se. Critical danger: do not translate as \"postmetaphysics\" (one word) which might suggest a total break rather than a transformation.\n    24→\n    25→## 前形而上学\n    26→- **Main translation**: pre-metaphysics\n    27→- **Alternatives**:\n    28→  - \"traditional metaphysics\"\n    29→  - \"classical metaphysics\"\n    30→  - \"metaphysics before nihilism\"\n    31→- **Note**: The author's term for the entire Western and Chinese metaphysical traditions before the advent of nihilism—from Thales through Hegel in the West, from the Yijing through Neo-Confucianism in China. The defining feature is the pursuit of 终极实在 (ultimate reality, 第〇实在) without awareness that this pursuit is non-rational. The author characterizes this tradition as \"a progressive retreat from ultimate reality toward practicality\" in which \"the more one seeks, the more one discovers there is nothing to find.\" The \"pre\" is relative to the crisis of nihilism, not chronologically primitive. Must be distinguished from \"ancient metaphysics\" which would miss the structural designation.\n    32→\n    33→## 第〇实在\n    34→- **Main translation**: Zeroth Reality\n    35→- **Alternatives**:\n    36→  - \"Ultimate Reality\" (as explanatory gloss, but risks missing the structural numbering)\n    37→  - \"Reality-Zero\" (more colloquial)\n    38→- **Note**: This is the author's term for what traditional metaphysics calls 终极实在 (ultimate reality)—the Dao, the Unmoved Mover, God, the thing-in-itself, the noumenon. The \"zeroth\" numbering is philosophically loaded: it designates a structural placeholder that we can never reach from within the system. We start at 1 (phenomena), proceed to 2 (constructed objects), and can never reach 0. The crucial move is that whenever we articulate 第〇实在, the articulation itself becomes 第二实在 (a construction). This parallels Kant's unknowable thing-in-itself and Wittgenstein's \"what can be shown but not said,\" but is more economical: it is a single structural observation. The translation must preserve the numbering system. The term \"ultimate reality\" loses the epistemic inaccessibility built into \"zeroth.\" Critical danger: do not translate as \"non-reality\" or \"zero reality\" which would suggest non-existence rather than inaccessibility.\n    39→\n    40→## 第一实在\n    41→- **Main translation**: First Reality\n    42→- **Alternatives**: None recommended (the numbering must be preserved)\n    43→- **Note**: This designates phenomena (现象) as what we encounter first, epistemically and practically. CRITICAL: The author explicitly states (footnote 25) that \"第一实在\" is a name (名称), not an ontological claim that phenomena are the ultimate stuff of reality. It designates epistemic-practical priority: phenomena are indubitable, cannot be bypassed, and are the necessary starting point for all metaphysical construction. This parallels Husserl's principle of principles and the phenomenological Lebenswelt. The \"first\" means first in the order of access, not first in the order of being. Any translation suggesting ontological foundationalism (like \"primary reality\" with connotations of \"most real\") would be a serious error. The translation must include the author's footnote explaining this is a designation of epistemic priority.\n    44→\n    45→## 第二实在\n    46→- **Main translation**: Second Reality\n    47→- **Alternatives**:\n    48→  - \"Constructed Reality\" (as explanatory gloss, but loses the numbering)\n    49→  - \"Secondary Reality\" (acceptable but \"Second Reality\" is cleaner)\n    50→- **Note**: This consists of the constructions we build upon phenomena—the \"things\" (东西) we posit as persisting objects, the concepts we abstract, the frameworks we assemble. The objective world (客观世界) is explicitly called a \"model\" (模型) based on phenomena. This is the domain of 形而上—all our metaphysical constructs live here. The numbering indicates it is reached second, after phenomena. This parallels Kant's empirical objects (constituted through categories), Carnap's framework-internal entities, and scientific models in constructive empiricism. The translation must preserve the constructive character: Second Reality is built from First Reality, not discovered behind it.\n    51→\n    52→## 实在\n    53→- **Main translation**: reality (when used alone); actuality\n    54→- **Alternatives**:\n    55→  - \"the real\" (when used substantively)\n    56→  - \"what is real\" (when emphasizing question of existence)\n    57→- **Note**: This term has a complex relationship to Western \"reality.\" In the author's system, it appears in the three-fold schema (第〇/第一/第二实在) which stratifies what counts as \"real\" according to epistemic access and constructive order. When used without numerical prefix, 实在 can mean simply \"reality\" in the ordinary sense, but the author's framework implies we must always ask: which reality? The term carries connotations of substantiality and mind-independence in classical Chinese philosophy, but the author's use is more phenomenological—实在 is what shows up for us, what has presence, not necessarily what exists independently. Danger: translating as \"substance\" would import Aristotelian baggage; \"being\" would conflate with 存在.\n    58→\n    59→## 现象\n    60→- **Main translation**: phenomena (plural); phenomenon (singular)\n    61→- **Alternatives**:\n    62→  - \"phenomenal experience\" when emphasizing the experiential aspect\n    63→  - \"appearances\" (only with strong contextual caveat—see note)\n    64→- **Note**: The author uses this term closer to the phenomenological tradition (Husserl, Heidegger) than to Kant. For the author, phenomena are NOT \"mere appearances\" contrasted with things-in-themselves; they are the indubitable ground of all experience, what cannot be doubted because doubting phenomena leaves no ground to stand on. The author explicitly identifies phenomena with \"all feelings/sensations taken together\" (全部的感受之总和). This includes both sensory input and the associations/connections between them (which are themselves felt/experienced). CRITICAL: phenomena are not a veil over reality but the inescapable starting point—第一实在. The author states: \"我们任何的对于现象的理解，都基于现象\" (any understanding we have of phenomena is based on phenomena). Translating as \"appearances\" risks suggesting they are merely apparent rather than the ground of certainty.\n    65→\n    66→## 恒常\n    67→- **Main translation**: constancy\n    68→- **Alternatives**:\n    69→  - \"permanence\" (too strong—implies timeless eternity)\n    70→  - \"invariance\" (too technical/mathematical)\n    71→  - \"regularity\" (too weak—misses the identity aspect)\n    72→- **Note**: The author identifies constancy as \"the core of metaphysics.\" This is the demand we impose on phenomena—that they will repeat, that same will remain same, that patterns will hold. The author explicitly connects constancy to identity (同一) and causation (因果), noting that causation is just identity across time. This echoes Hume's constant conjunction but goes further: constancy is not a property discovered in the world but a non-rational demand we impose to act meaningfully. Without constancy, we have no \"grip\" (抓手) on phenomena. The term must convey: (1) something holding steady across change, (2) repeatability, (3) recognizable sameness. \"Constancy\" in English captures this—it suggests faithful repetition without the excessive strength of \"permanence\" (which implies unchanging eternality like Platonic Forms) or the weakness of \"regularity\" (which suggests pattern without identity).\n    73→\n    74→## 境\n    75→- **Main translation**: jing (transliterated, with gloss); alternatively \"sphere\" or \"realm\"\n    76→- **Alternatives**:\n    77→  - \"sphere\" (captures spatial/structural aspect, precedent in Sloterdijk)\n    78→  - \"realm\" (captures domain/region aspect)\n    79→  - \"experiential sphere\" (fuller gloss)\n    80→  - \"domain\" (neutral but less evocative)\n    81→  - \"境界\" as \"boundary\" or \"horizon\" (when in compound)\n    82→- **Note**: This is the most important and most difficult term in the collection. The author uses it in several interrelated senses: (1) as the title concept (境集, Collection of Jing), (2) as abbreviation of 梦境 (dreamscape/dream-realm), (3) as E in the formal system (the categorical structure on phenomena), (4) as encompassing multiple semantic fields—境界 (boundary/horizon), 环境 (environment), 境地 (situation/predicament), 境 as \"state/realm.\" In the category-theoretic framework, 境 (E) is defined as \"a structure on phenomena (P) described categorically: we select parts of phenomena as objects, and connections between them (associations, themselves part of phenomena) as morphisms.\" The Analysis Report suggests: \"The term resists single-word translation because it simultaneously denotes a bounded experiential domain, the structure of that domain, and the felt quality of inhabiting it.\" I strongly recommend transliteration as \"jing\" with a glossary entry explaining its semantic range, particularly in formal/technical contexts. In more literary contexts, \"sphere\" works well. AVOID: \"world\" (too broad, conflicts with 世界), \"state\" (too static), \"境界\" should not be translated as \"state\" either—prefer \"boundary,\" \"horizon,\" or \"limit.\"\n    83→\n    84→## 境界\n    85→- **Main translation**: boundary; horizon; limit\n    86→- **Alternatives**:\n    87→  - \"realm\" (when 境界 is used to mean a delimited domain rather than the limit itself)\n    88→  - \"sphere\" (in contexts overlapping with 境)\n    89→- **Note**: Compound of 境 (realm/sphere) and 界 (boundary/limit). In classical usage, 境界 can mean \"state/level/realm\" (as in spiritual attainment), but in the author's more technical usage it emphasizes the boundary or horizon that delimits a 境. The author uses it in phrases like \"语言的境界\" (the boundary of language) to indicate limits of a domain. The phenomenological parallel is Husserl's \"horizon\" (Horizont)—the limit of what can be meaningfully entertained within a framework. Do not translate simply as \"state\" or \"level\" without considering whether the author means the boundary/horizon itself.\n    90→\n    91→## 虚无\n    92→- **Main translation**: nothingness; the void\n    93→- **Alternatives**:\n    94→  - \"nihility\" (in contexts about nihilism as philosophical position)\n    95→  - \"emptiness\" (would be better for 空 in Buddhist contexts)\n    96→- **Note**: In the author's framework, 虚无主义 (nihilism) is not a positive doctrine but a lack/absence—\"not a something, a doctrine, but a nothing, a void.\" The author states: \"Nihilism is not produced or created, just as void is not produced or created, but rather because nothing was produced or created—nothing is here.\" This is not Buddhist emptiness (空) which has positive ontological significance, but rather the crisis following the loss of 最高价值 (highest values) or 终极实在 (ultimate reality). The translation must avoid suggesting nihilism is a positive philosophy rather than a crisis of absence.\n    97→\n    98→## 本质\n    99→- **Main translation**: essence; essential nature\n   100→- **Alternatives**:\n   101→  - \"nature\" (in less technical contexts)\n   102→  - \"whatness\" (technical, echoing scholastic \"quidditas\")\n   103→- **Note**: In traditional metaphysics, essence (本质) is what a thing most fundamentally is—its necessary properties, its defining features, its 所以然 (reason for being so). In the author's post-metaphysical framework, what we call \"essence\" is reinterpreted: the essence of X is not a hidden inner nature but rather the universal property (泛性质/范性质) of a stable subcategory in the structure E—it is that feeling/experience to which all instances of X are connected. For example, \"what is 忒修斯之船 (Theseus's ship)? It is that experience which you associate with any part of the ship, or which makes you think of all parts when mentioned.\" Essence becomes a structural position, not an intrinsic property. Critical translation danger: readers may import substance metaphysics (Aristotelian ousia) when the author has relocated essence to categorical position.\n   104→\n   105→## 存在\n   106→- **Main translation**: existence; being; to exist\n   107→- **Alternatives**:\n   108→  - \"being\" (when used philosophically/abstractly as in Western \"Being\")\n   109→  - \"existence\" (when asking whether something exists)\n   110→  - \"is\" / \"to be\" (in verbal constructions)\n   111→- **Note**: This term can function as verb (\"to exist\") or noun (\"existence/being\"). The author does not develop a detailed ontology of being/existence (in fact, the framework is designed to avoid traditional ontological commitments), but existence is tied to presence in phenomena: something exists (for us) insofar as it appears in 第一实在 (phenomena) or is a well-grounded construction in 第二实在. The phrase \"有效存在\" (effective existence) appears in Essay 1, used analogously to renormalization in physics—an entity that \"effectively exists\" at a given scale without needing to be ontologically fundamental. Do not assume this maps cleanly onto Heidegger's Sein/Seiende distinction—the author's concerns are more epistemological and practical.\n   112→\n   113→## 超越\n   114→- **Main translation**: transcendence (noun); to transcend (verb)\n   115→- **Alternatives**:\n   116→  - \"go beyond\" (verbal, less technical)\n   117→  - \"surpass\" (when emphasizing exceeding limits)\n   118→- **Note**: The author uses this term in specific contexts: (1) the traditional metaphysical quest for 第〇实在 is a (failed) attempt at transcendence—to reach beyond phenomena to ultimate reality; (2) in discussing the evolution of 境, the author mentions \"超越\" as what lies outside the current boundary of thought—\"what enables thought to transcend itself\" is what enters thought (the dynamic aspect, 思想之外 entering 思想). The author is clear that true transcendence (reaching 第〇实在) is impossible from within the system, but there is a dynamic sense of \"transcendence\" as the evolution/transformation of one's experiential sphere. This is not transcendence to a higher realm but immanent self-transformation. AVOID: \"transcendental\" (Kantian term of art) unless specifically discussing Kant.\n   119→\n   120→## 超越性\n   121→- **Main translation**: transcendence (as quality/property); transcendent character\n   122→- **Alternatives**:\n   123→  - \"the transcendent\" (substantive)\n   124→  - \"transcendentality\" (rare, but distinguishes from Kantian \"transcendental\")\n   125→- **Note**: The nominal form, referring to the quality of transcending or being transcendent. The author uses this particularly when discussing death: \"自己的死亡对于自己是超越性的\" (one's own death is transcendent for oneself)—meaning death is beyond the boundary of one's experiential sphere, unknowable from within life. Transcendence (超越性) marks what is outside the 境界 (boundary). This is close to Wittgenstein's \"whereof one cannot speak\" but applied to experience rather than language.\n   126→\n   127→## 诗意\n   128→- **Main translation**: the poetic\n   129→- **Alternatives**:\n   130→  - \"poiesis\" (Greek: making/bringing-forth; more technical)\n   131→  - \"poetic engagement\" (fuller gloss)\n   132→- **Note**: This is the author's term for the proper post-metaphysical stance toward meaning and existence. It does NOT mean \"poetry\" in the literary sense. The author defines it as \"清醒的梦境\" (the lucid dreamscape)—being fully invested in meaning while knowing that meaning is constructed. The poetic stance is contrasted with \"沉醉的梦境\" (the intoxicated dreamscape, i.e., pre-metaphysical belief/faith where one doesn't realize one is in a dreamscape). The poetic means: (1) knowing you are in a constructed 境, (2) nonetheless fully investing in it and taking it seriously, (3) thereby accessing the experience/meaning it enables. The author states: \"清醒不意味着我们对其目的毫不在意，对梦境毫无投入。清醒的梦境依旧也必然意味着对梦境的全身心之投入\" (lucidity does not mean we don't care about purpose or invest in the dreamscape; the lucid dreamscape still requires full-hearted investment). This echoes Heidegger's turn to Dichtung (poetry) as authentic dwelling and Nietzsche's affirmation despite the death of God. \"Poiesis\" (making) might be more precise philosophically, but \"the poetic\" is more accessible and preserves the connection to poetry/aesthetics which the author invokes in examples (games, novels, art).\n   133→\n   134→## 梦境\n   135→- **Main translation**: dreamscape\n   136→- **Alternatives**:\n   137→  - \"dream-sphere\" (maintaining connection to 境)\n   138→  - \"dream-realm\"\n   139→  - \"the oneiric sphere\" (highly literary/technical)\n   140→- **Note**: The author uses this as a technical term for the experiential environment in which meaning arises. It is defined broadly: \"任何感受都有使得他得以展现的'环境'，而这些'环境'即是我所叙的'梦境'\" (any feeling has an 'environment' that enables it to manifest, and these 'environments' are what I call 'dreamscape'). Examples include: games (with clear rules/goals), novels (narrative worlds), rituals (like burning incense to express mourning). The \"dream\" metaphor indicates: (1) constructed/artificial character (not given by nature), (2) immersive quality (you inhabit it), (3) capacity to evoke powerful experience despite being constructed. The author's key insight is that we already live in multiple 梦境 daily—from the frameworks of our concepts to the arrangement of our rooms. \"Dreamscape\" works well in English because it combines \"dream\" with \"landscape/scope,\" suggesting both the illusory-yet-serious quality and the spatial/environmental aspect. Connection to \"lucid dreaming\" (being aware you're dreaming while dreaming) is explicit in the text.\n   141→\n   142→## 沉醉的梦境\n   143→- **Main translation**: the intoxicated dreamscape\n   144→- **Alternatives**:\n   145→  - \"the unreflective dreamscape\"\n   146→  - \"faith\" or \"belief\" (as functional equivalents, but lose the 境 structure)\n   147→- **Note**: The author's term for pre-metaphysical existence: being in a 梦境 without knowing you're in one. \"沉醉\" (intoxicated/immersed/absorbed) indicates lack of critical distance. The author identifies this with belief/faith where purpose appears as \"logically groundless\" (逻辑上无理由的) because one doesn't see it as constructed—it appears as ultimate reality, the unmoved mover, the first cause. This is not merely \"false consciousness\" (Marxist sense) but a phenomenological description of how meaning appears when the 第〇实在 is not yet disenchanted. The pre-metaphysical person is intoxicated not because they are drunk/impaired but because they are fully immersed without self-awareness of immersion.\n   148→\n   149→## 清醒的梦境\n   150→- **Main translation**: the lucid dreamscape\n   151→- **Alternatives**:\n   152→  - \"the self-aware dreamscape\"\n   153→  - \"the reflective dreamscape\"\n   154→- **Note**: The author's term for post-metaphysical, poetic existence: being in a 梦境 while knowing you're in one, yet still fully investing. \"清醒\" (lucid/awake/clear-headed) indicates self-awareness. The author explicitly invokes \"lucid dreaming\" (knowing you're dreaming while dreaming) as the metaphor. This is the stance enabled by recognizing the disenchantment of 第〇实在—you know meaning is constructed (not ultimate), yet you engage fully because (1) feeling/experience is already-given (we cannot not feel), (2) meaning is the twin-face of feeling (意义和感受即是两面一体), (3) full investment is required to access the experience (otherwise the 境 doesn't work—like flipping a coin to make a decision only works if you commit to following it). The English \"lucid dreamscape\" perfectly captures this via the existing concept of lucid dreaming.\n   155→\n   156→## 德\n   157→- **Main translation**: virtue (in Confucian contexts); power (in Daoist contexts); de (transliterated when referring to the philosophical concept)\n   158→- **Alternatives**:\n   159→  - \"excellence\" (aretaic sense)\n   160→  - \"inner power\" / \"potency\" (especially in 道德 Dao-De pairing)\n   161→  - \"characteristic nature\" (when referring to 狗德 dog-nature, 人德 human-nature)\n   162→- **Note**: Notoriously difficult term. In the 道德仁义礼 sequence the author analyzes (from Laozi), 德 appears as what is \"common to all X\" (人德 is what all humans should have; more generally, 德 is the operating principle of each kind of thing). The author's analysis shows: (1) historically, 德 was abstracted from particular 仁 (specific virtues), (2) logically in pre-metaphysics, 德 appears as generating 仁 (because you are human [德], you should have 仁). The translation depends heavily on context. In \"人德\" (human de), translate as \"human nature\" or \"what makes humans human.\" In \"道德\" (Dao-De), consider keeping \"De\" transliterated or using \"virtue/power.\" The key is recognizing the author is analyzing the structural inversion (genetic vs. logical order), not making claims about what 德 \"really means.\" A translator's note on 德's semantic range (virtue, power, nature, characteristic) is essential.\n   163→\n   164→## 道\n   165→- **Main translation**: Dao (transliterated); the Way (traditional rendering)\n   166→- **Alternatives**:\n   167→  - \"the Dao\" (with article)\n   168→  - \"the Way\" (only with contextualization)\n   169→- **Note**: The author uses 道 primarily in the context of analyzing the 道德仁义礼 sequence from the *Daodejing*, but explicitly states this is NOT an interpretation of Laozi—rather, the sequence serves as an example of the structural inversion (genetic vs. logical order) typical of pre-metaphysics. In that structure, 道 appears as the ultimate generative principle (the most \"meta\" of metaphysics, 形而上 to the highest degree), yet the author shows it is actually abstracted last (from 德, which is abstracted from 仁, etc.). The author notes: \"更加符合道家的关于'道'的解释更类似于使得存在得以成立的那个东西。形象地说，就像是对于一幅画而言的画纸一样\" (a more Daoist interpretation of Dao would be like the canvas for a painting—what enables existence). However, in the author's framework, this role is structurally impossible to occupy (it would be 第〇实在, unreachable). Translation recommendation: transliterate as \"Dao\" and provide footnotes on the structural role in the argument. Avoid over-committing to any particular Daoist interpretation.\n   170→\n   171→## 属性\n   172→- **Main translation**: property; attribute\n   173→- **Alternatives**:\n   174→  - \"characteristic\" (less technical)\n   175→  - \"quality\" (in some contexts)\n   176→- **Note**: The author uses this in the logical/metaphysical sense: a property is what can be predicated of a subject. The critical move in the 道德仁义礼 analysis is that what begins as a property (仁 is a property some people have) becomes transformed into a definition (仁 is what humans essentially are/should be). The author states: \"人可以拥有的一个属性，在这里既是'仁'，反而变成了人的一个定义\" (a property humans can have, here 仁, instead becomes a definition of humans). This transformation—from contingent attribute to necessary essence—is part of the logical inversion that buries the genetic order. Standard translation as \"property\" works, but the translator must track where 属性 transforms into 定义 in the author's argument.\n   177→\n   178→## 定义\n   179→- **Main translation**: definition\n   180→- **Alternatives**:\n   181→  - \"to define\" (verbal)\n   182→- **Note**: In formal logic, a definition specifies necessary and sufficient conditions. In the author's analysis, what starts as inductive generalization (a property many Xs happen to have) gets transformed into a definition (what X essentially is, what X must be to count as X). This is the \"自上而下\" (top-down) explanatory move that inverts the \"自下而上\" (bottom-up) genetic order. The author notes this happens when we move from \"人都是（可以）有仁的\" (humans all [can] have ren) to \"人都是（应该）有仁的\" (humans all [should] have ren) to \"有仁的才是人\" (only those with ren are [truly] human). Definition thus becomes prescriptive, not merely descriptive. Standard translation as \"definition\" works if the translator tracks the prescriptive force.\n   183→\n   184→## 范畴\n   185→- **Main translation**: category\n   186→- **Alternatives**:\n   187→  - \"范畴论\" = \"category theory\" (the mathematical discipline)\n   188→- **Note**: This term has two distinct uses: (1) Kantian categories (pure concepts of understanding like causality, substance), (2) mathematical category theory (objects and morphisms). The author primarily uses it in sense (2) when developing the formal framework (E as a category on phenomena P, with experiences as objects and associations as morphisms). However, there's a deep connection to sense (1): the author's \"constancy\" (恒常) plays a role similar to Kant's categories—it is a non-rational (but necessary) demand we impose on phenomena to make action possible. The translation must distinguish \"category theory\" (mathematical) from \"categories\" (Kantian), though the philosophical overlap is intentional. In mathematical contexts, always \"category\" (范畴) and never \"category theory\" unless the text says 范畴论.\n   189→\n   190→## 构造\n   191→- **Main translation**: construction; to construct\n   192→- **Alternatives**:\n   193→  - \"configuration\" (when emphasizing arrangement)\n   194→  - \"structure\" (overlaps with 结构, use carefully)\n   195→- **Note**: The author distinguishes 描述 (description) from 构造 (construction). E (境) is descriptive of P (phenomena), not constructive—E is \"a structure on P,\" not \"P is generated by E.\" However, within the category-theoretic framework, a \"构造\" is a specific technical notion: \"a tower-structure built from a base set of objects (基石) in a specific way, generating the full subcategory M\" (see the 道德仁义礼 examples with different orderings). A \"metaphysics\" (第三种形而上) is defined as a construction on M. The term carries connotations of active building/making, contrasting with passive description or discovery. Standard translation as \"construction\" works, but note the technical use in the formal sections.\n   196→\n   197→## 感受\n   198→- **Main translation**: feeling; experience; sensation\n   199→- **Alternatives**:\n   200→  - \"felt experience\" (fuller gloss)\n   201→  - \"感受\" has two senses the author distinguishes in footnote: (1) received information/stimuli (刺激), (2) the \"crystallization/flow\" that these arrive at (the felt quality)\n   202→- **Note**: This is one of the most important terms in the framework. The author explicitly identifies phenomena (现象) with \"all feelings taken together\" (全部的感受之总和). 感受 is more phenomenological than 感觉 (sensation in the bare sensory sense). The author states meaning and feeling are \"two faces of one body\" (意义和感受即是两面一体). In the category-theoretic framework, both the objects (experiences) AND the morphisms (associations/connections between experiences) are 感受—they are all parts of phenomena, all felt/experienced. This is why E has tower-structure: the connections between experiences are themselves experiences. Translation must preserve the felt, subjective, experiential quality. \"Feeling\" works well but may be too emotional; \"experience\" works but may be too cognitive; context determines best choice. The dual sense (stimulus vs. felt-quality) should be noted in translator footnotes.\n   203→\n   204→## 非理性\n   205→- **Main translation**: the non-rational\n   206→- **Alternatives**:\n   207→  - \"non-rationality\" (nominal form)\n   208→  - AVOID: \"irrational\" (has pejorative connotations)\n   209→  - AVOID: \"arational\" (too obscure)\n   210→- **Note**: This is a crucial concept for the author's framework, and the translation must be precise. \"非理性\" is NOT \"irrational\" (against reason, contrary to reason, defective reasoning). It is \"outside the domain of reason\" or \"beyond reason's reach.\" The author's argument: the purpose of reason must lie outside reason (an analytic truth about purpose—a journey's destination is not the journey itself). Therefore, the pursuit of ultimate reality is non-rational. Therefore, nihilism (as response to loss of ultimate reality) is also non-rational. The author states: \"这种非理性是应当被承认的\" (this non-rationality should be acknowledged). The \"non-rational\" is not defective but necessary—it is the domain of will, feeling, attunement. This echoes Schopenhauer's Will, Nietzsche's Dionysian, Heidegger's pre-theoretical Stimmung. The English \"the non-rational\" (with article, as substantive) correctly captures this: a domain outside reason but not opposed to it, not inferior to it, but simply other. \"Irrational\" in English means \"contrary to reason\" or \"lacking reason\" (pejorative), which would completely misrepresent the author's position.\n   211→\n   212→## 现象礼 / 现象仁 / 现象义\n   213→- **Main translation**: phenomenal li (ritual); phenomenal ren (humaneness); phenomenal yi (righteousness)\n   214→- **Alternatives**: Keep classical terms transliterated (li, ren, yi) with \"phenomenal\" qualifier\n   215→- **Note**: These are the author's coinages to distinguish the original experiential basis (what is actually felt/observed in phenomena) from the metaphysical constructs (礼, 仁, 义 as abstract principles). \"现象X\" means \"X as it appears in phenomena before being theorized.\" For example, 现象礼 is the actual behavior of treating others respectfully that I observe; 现象仁 is the actual feeling I have toward others; 现象义 is the actual motivation I feel to act. These are distinguished from 礼/仁/义 as constructed principles that then get inverted (appearing to generate the phenomena rather than being abstracted from them). The translation should preserve the technical distinction by keeping the classical terms transliterated and adding \"phenomenal\" as qualifier.\n   216→\n   217→## 祛魅\n   218→- **Main translation**: disenchantment\n   219→- **Alternatives**: None (this is the standard translation)\n   220→- **Note**: This directly corresponds to Max Weber's \"Entzauberung\" and is standard in philosophical translation. The author uses it to describe what happens to 第〇实在 in post-metaphysics: we recognize its \"special status\" was conferred by non-rational impulse, not by its actual accessibility or ontological privilege. Disenchantment is not a loss but a clarification. The magic is removed not because magic was false, but because we now see it was never the kind of thing that could be accessed/articulated (since any articulation makes it 第二实在, not 第〇实在).\n   221→\n   222→## 终极实在\n   223→- **Main translation**: ultimate reality\n   224→- **Alternatives**:\n   225→  - \"absolute reality\"\n   226→  - \"fundamental reality\"\n   227→- **Note**: This is the ordinary Chinese term for what the author technically designates as 第〇实在 (Zeroth Reality). It refers to what traditional metaphysics seeks: the Dao, the Unmoved Mover, God, the thing-in-itself, the noumenon, Plato's Forms, etc. The author's move is to show this is structurally unreachable: whenever articulated, it becomes 第二实在 (a construction). The translation as \"ultimate reality\" is standard and captures the intended meaning (the final, foundational, most real reality). The philosophical work is done by the author's argument that this concept is incoherent (or at least inaccessible), not by the translation choice.\n   228→\n   229→## 实践\n   230→- **Main translation**: practice; praxis\n   231→- **Alternatives**:\n   232→  - \"practical engagement\"\n   233→  - \"praxis\" (when emphasizing Marxist/Aristotelian connotations)\n   234→- **Note**: This is the core of the author's post-metaphysics. The author defines the \"functional character\" of post-metaphysics as \"理想和现象之重叠——实践\" (the overlap of ideal and phenomenon—practice). Practice is where the metaphysical constructs (第二实在, ideals) and phenomena (第一实在) come together—where we act in the world guided by concepts, and where concepts are tested/revised by experience. This echoes: (1) Aristotle's phronesis (practical wisdom), (2) Marx's praxis (theory-informed action that transforms reality), (3) Dewey's pragmatism (experience as organism-environment interaction). The author states: \"我们正是这样的创造者，是自己生命和感受的诗人\" (we are creators, poets of our own lives and feelings) through practice. Translation as \"practice\" works well; \"praxis\" works in academic contexts.\n   235→\n   236→## 主体间性\n   237→- **Main translation**: intersubjectivity\n   238→- **Alternatives**: None (technical term)\n   239→- **Note**: The author mentions this briefly as one of the \"solved problems\" but does not develop it in detail in these essays. Intersubjectivity (how multiple subjects/consciousnesses relate, how shared meaning is possible) is a central problem in phenomenology (Husserl) and critical theory (Habermas). The author's framework would presumably address this through the category-theoretic structure: if multiple subjects have similar E structures on overlapping P (phenomena), their 境 can align. The translation is standard philosophical terminology.\n   240→\n   241→## 自我实现\n   242→- **Main translation**: self-realization\n   243→- **Alternatives**:\n   244→  - \"self-actualization\" (Maslow's term, more psychological)\n   245→- **Note**: The author uses this in a specific sense: \"使得自我得以成为现实\" (making the self become actual/real). This is tied to the need for practice and the overlap of ideal and phenomenon: \"我们在现象中看到我们自身，证实我的存在，使得现象成为'我的一部分'\" (we see ourselves in phenomena, confirm my existence, make phenomena become 'part of me'). This echoes Hegel's Selbstverwirklichung (spirit actualizing itself in the world) and Marxist self-realization through labor. For the author, self-realization happens when: (1) I act on the world according to my ideals (practical engagement), (2) I see my ideals reflected back in phenomena (the world bears my mark), (3) thereby confirming my existence and extending my 境. \"Self-realization\" captures this better than \"self-actualization\" (which is more about fulfilling potential than about making-real).\n   246→\n   247→## 第〇种 / 第一种 / 第二种 / 第三种 (形而上)\n   248→- **Main translation**:\n   249→  - 第〇种: Zeroth Kind (of metaphysics)\n   250→  - 第一种: First Kind\n   251→  - 第二种: Second Kind\n   252→  - 第三种: Third Kind\n   253→- **Alternatives**:\n   254→  - \"Type Zero, Type One,\" etc. (but \"Kind\" better emphasizes qualitative distinction)\n   255→- **Note**: This is the author's four-fold classification of metaphysical operations:\n   256→  - **Zeroth Kind**: Recognition of \"things\" and basic abstraction from raw phenomena (e.g., recognizing this apple as a persistent object)\n   257→  - **First Kind**: Projection of past regularities into future (induction, prediction)\n   258→  - **Second Kind**: Abstracting concepts from repeated patterns (e.g., \"honesty\" abstracted from honest acts)\n   259→  - **Third Kind**: Combination of abstractions into frameworks and values (systematic metaphysics)\n   260→\n   261→  The numbering parallels the 第〇/第一/第二实在 schema. The \"zeroth kind\" is foundational (works from \"original/raw\" phenomena) while First and Second kinds can work from both phenomena AND already-formed concepts. All three kinds involve a two-step process: (1) recognition of constancy/repetition, (2) fixing that recognition as a concept detached from particular phenomena. The Third Kind operates on the constructs of the Second Kind. Translation must preserve the numbering system. The parallel to Aristotelian abstraction, Humean induction, and Hegelian systematization is strong.\n   262→\n   263→## 泛性质 / 范性质\n   264→- **Main translation**: universal property\n   265→- **Alternatives**: None (this is standard mathematical terminology)\n   266→- **Note**: This is the standard term from category theory (范畴论). A universal property characterizes an object by its relationships to all other objects in a category (e.g., initial/terminal objects, products, limits). The author uses this philosophically: the universal property of a subcategory is what we experience as the \"essence\" or \"nature\" of a concept. For example, in the subcategory of \"all things related to me,\" the universal property (the terminal object to which everything in that subcategory connects) IS the feeling of \"me\"—that's what \"I\" am. This is a profound move: essence is relocated from intrinsic nature to categorical position, from substance to structure. The translation must use the standard mathematical term and provide philosophical glosses explaining the application to phenomenology.\n   267→\n   268→## 联想\n   269→- **Main translation**: association\n   270→- **Alternatives**:\n   271→  - \"connection\" (less technical)\n   272→  - \"associative link\"\n   273→- **Note**: In the categorical framework, 联想 are the morphisms (arrows) in E. They are the connections between experiences—when seeing X makes you think of Y, that association is a morphism from X to Y. Crucially, these associations are themselves experiences (感受), which is why E has tower-structure: morphisms are also objects. The term echoes Hume's \"association of ideas\" (the mind connecting ideas by resemblance, contiguity, causation), but the author's framework is more structural. The association is not just a psychological link but a felt connection that has its own experiential quality. \"Association\" is the natural English translation and carries the right psychological/philosophical connotations.\n   274→\n   275→## 客观世界\n   276→- **Main translation**: objective world\n   277→- **Alternatives**:\n   278→  - \"external world\" (when emphasizing mind-independence)\n   279→- **Note**: The author's key move: \"客观世界 is a model (模型) based on phenomena.\" This is not metaphysical realism (the view that objective world exists independently) but constructive empiricism: we build a model of an objective world from phenomena (第一实在), and this model (consisting of persistent objects, causal relations, etc.) is 第二实在 (Second Reality). The author states: \"形式上，倘若一开始没有任何东西，那么先存在一个真正的客观世界，和先存在现象，有着巨大的区别\" (formally, if nothing existed initially, whether a truly objective world or phenomena existed first makes a huge difference). Since we inescapably start from phenomena, we have no access to a \"truly objective world\" behind them—only our model. Translation as \"objective world\" is correct but must be accompanied by notes explaining it's a constructed model.\n   280→\n   281→## 元阶 (meta order)\n   282→- **Main translation**: meta-order; meta-level\n   283→- **Alternatives**:\n   284→  - \"order\" (when clear from context)\n   285→  - \"level\" (less technical)\n   286→- **Note**: This is a technical term from the tower-structure construction. In category theory, a \"meta-category\" treats morphisms as objects. The author constructs: T₀ (base objects) → T₁ (morphisms of T₀ as objects) → T₂ (morphisms of T₁ as objects) → ... → T∞. An object's \"绝对元阶\" (absolute meta-order) is which level it first appears. An object's \"相对元阶\" (relative meta-order) is defined relative to a chosen \"base stone\" (基石). The 道德仁义礼 examples show how the same subcategory can be assigned different meta-orders (orderings) depending on whether we construct bottom-up (from 礼 to 道) or top-down (from 道 to 礼)—these are different \"metaphysics\" (第三种形而上). Translation should use \"meta-order\" to preserve the technical sense; explanatory footnotes are essential.\n   287→\n   288→## 基石\n   289→- **Main translation**: base stone; foundation stone\n   290→- **Alternatives**:\n   291→  - \"base object\" (more technical)\n   292→  - \"starting point\"\n   293→- **Note**: In the tower-structure construction, the 基石 are the objects we designate as \"absolute 1-meta-order\" (or sometimes 0-meta-order if we include a T₀ level). Everything else is constructed from these. Choosing different base stones gives different \"constructions\" and thus different \"metaphysics.\" For example, in one 道德仁义礼 construction, 道 is the base stone (0-meta-order) and everything is generated from it (top-down metaphysics). In another, 礼 is the base stone and everything is abstracted from it (bottom-up metaphysics). The metaphor of \"stone\" suggests solidity/foundation. \"Base stone\" or \"foundation stone\" captures this; \"base object\" is more technical but loses the metaphorical force.\n   294→\n   295→## 塔式结构\n   296→- **Main translation**: tower structure\n   297→- **Alternatives**: None needed (direct translation works)\n   298→- **Note**: A category where morphisms are also objects, creating a tower: objects → (morphisms as objects) → (morphisms of morphisms as objects) → .... The author shows that E (境, the categorical structure on phenomena) is a tower structure because associations (morphisms) are themselves experiences (objects). This is formalized through the tower construction (T₀ → T₁ → T₂ → ... → T∞). The \"tower\" metaphor suggests ascending levels. The structure has a \"flattening\" quality (压平) when viewed as an arrows-only metacategory—all levels collapse into a single plane of arrows. Translation is straightforward as \"tower structure\"; mathematical readers will recognize the concept even if not the exact term.\n   299→\n   300→## 稳定子范畴\n   301→- **Main translation**: stable subcategory\n   302→- **Alternatives**:\n   303→  - \"stabilized subcategory\"\n   304→- **Note**: The author's conjecture (KA conjecture, mentioned but not fully developed) is that universal properties in stable subcategories of E correspond to what we experience as \"essences.\" A \"stable\" subcategory presumably means one that persists across time/evolution of E, though the author does not give a precise definition. This is part of the formal apparatus that \"runs ahead of its interpretation\" (as the Analysis Report notes). Translation should remain close to mathematical language while noting the interpretation is incomplete.\n   305→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

Preserve the philosophical weight; avoid colloquial uses suggesting \"superficial appearance.\"\n    13→\n    14→---\n    15→\n    16→## 感受 (gǎnshòu)\n    17→- **Main translation**: feeling\n    18→- **Alternatives**:\n    19→  - \"felt experience\" (when emphasizing the experiential quality)\n    20→  - \"what is felt\" (when used as object rather than act)\n    21→  - \"affection\" (in technical contexts, drawing on Michel Henry)\n    22→- **Note**: The author uses 感受 to denote any element of P (the phenomenal totality). It encompasses sensory input, affective response, and experiential quality. This is broader than mere \"sensation\" — it includes both Husserl's \"Empfindung\" (sensory data) and the affective dimension emphasized by Michel Henry's material phenomenology. The author distinguishes (in footnote) between (1) received stimulation (感觉/刺激) and (2) the \"crystallization, surge, turbulence\" these give rise to. Both aspects are 感受. The term must preserve this dual valence: receptivity and affective resonance.\n    23→\n    24→---\n    25→\n    26→## 体验 (tǐyàn)\n    27→- **Main translation**: lived experience\n    28→- **Alternatives**:\n    29→  - \"experience\" (when context is clear)\n    30→  - \"Erlebnis\" (in scholarly contexts to signal the phenomenological tradition)\n    31→- **Note**: This is the Chinese equivalent of Husserl's \"Erlebnis\" — lived experience in its concrete fullness, as opposed to abstract knowledge or second-hand report. The author states: \"全部的感受之总和既是现象\" (the totality of all 感受 is 现象), and uses 体验 and 感受 somewhat interchangeably to denote elements of the phenomenal field. However, 体验 tends to emphasize the more integrated, meaning-laden dimension of experience, whereas 感受 can also mean discrete affective or sensory elements. The author's claim that \"意义和感受即是两面一体\" (meaning and feeling are two sides of one thing) connects this term to Merleau-Ponty's embodied, pre-reflective meaningfulness.\n    32→\n    33→---\n    34→\n    35→## 经验 (jīngyàn)\n    36→- **Main translation**: experience\n    37→- **Alternatives**:\n    38→  - \"empirical experience\" (to distinguish from 体验 when needed)\n    39→  - \"Erfahrung\" (in scholarly contexts contrasting with Erlebnis)\n    40→- **Note**: While less central in these essays than 感受 and 体验, when 经验 appears it often carries the connotation of accumulated, reflected-upon, or empirical experience — closer to Husserl's \"Erfahrung\" (constituted empirical experience) as opposed to \"Erlebnis\" (immediate lived experience). In contexts discussing empirical knowledge or induction, 经验 is appropriate. Reserve \"lived experience\" for 体验.\n    41→\n    42→---\n    43→\n    44→## 境 (jìng)\n    45→- **Main translation**: Jing (romanized, as technical term)\n    46→- **Alternatives**:\n    47→  - \"experiential milieu\" (descriptive gloss)\n    48→  - \"lived structure\" (emphasizing categorical structure)\n    49→  - \"Jing-structure\" or \"E-structure\" (when referring to the formalized category E)\n    50→  - \"lifeworld-structure\" (only when explicitly relating to Husserl's Lebenswelt)\n    51→- **Note**: This is the author's most original and difficult term. Initially called 梦境 (dreamscape), then formalized as E (for Enclosed, Emotion, Experience). It denotes a structured experiential field or milieu within which meaning arises through relations (态射/morphisms) among experiences. It is not merely \"境界\" (realm/state), but specifically the categorical structure imposed upon phenomenal field P. The author defines: \"我们选取𝔓中的部分作为𝔼中的对象，其中这些对象之间的联系（称之为联想）作为𝔼中的态射.\" The term resonates with Husserl's Lebenswelt and Heidegger's Welt, but emphasizes formal structure more explicitly. Recommend: retain \"Jing\" as technical term on first use, with gloss \"the structured experiential field\" or \"lived structure,\" then use \"Jing\" consistently thereafter. Chinese philosophical resonances (意境, 境界) should be acknowledged but not overemphasized, as the author's usage is more formal-categorical.\n    52→\n    53→---\n    54→\n    55→## 境界 (jìngjiè)\n    56→- **Main translation**: realm\n    57→- **Alternatives**:\n    58→  - \"domain\" (when emphasizing bounded region)\n    59→  - \"境-boundary\" or \"境-limit\" (when etymologically emphasizing 界 as boundary)\n    60→  - \"sphere\" (in philosophical contexts)\n    61→- **Note**: Distinguished from 境. The author uses 境界 to indicate the boundaries or limits of a domain — e.g., \"在语言的境界内\" (within the boundary/domain of language). This is more about delimitation than structure. In phenomenological terms, it refers to the horizon or scope of a region. Do not confuse with 境, which is the structured field itself. When 境界 appears, it often signals a discussion of what can and cannot be accessed within a given domain.\n    62→\n    63→---\n    64→\n    65→## 意向性 (yìxiàngxìng)\n    66→- **Main translation**: intentionality\n    67→- **Alternatives**: (none recommended)\n    68→- **Note**: Standard translation for Husserl's \"Intentionalität\" — consciousness is always consciousness-of-something. While the author does not use this term frequently in the analyzed essays, the concept is structurally encoded in the E-framework: objects of E are selected from P, and morphisms (联想/associations) connecting them are also elements of P. This \"tower structure\" where morphisms are themselves objects captures the iterability of intentional acts — we can reflect on our acts of consciousness, making them objects of new acts. The author has formalized Husserl's insight that intentionality is infinitely iterable.\n    69→\n    70→---\n    71→\n    72→## 意识 (yìshí)\n    73→- **Main translation**: consciousness\n    74→- **Alternatives**:\n    75→  - \"awareness\" (in contexts emphasizing wakeful attention rather than the philosophical structure)\n    76→- **Note**: Standard translation. The author's framework is about the structure of consciousness (how experiences are connected and meanings constituted), rather than consciousness as a metaphysical substance. When the author discusses 清醒 (lucid/awake), this relates to reflective consciousness (awareness of being in a 境), as opposed to 沉醉 (absorbed), which is pre-reflective immersion. The distinction parallels Husserl's \"natural attitude\" vs. \"phenomenological attitude,\" but without the transcendental-ego framework.\n    77→\n    78→---\n    79→\n    80→## 构造 (gòuzào)\n    81→- **Main translation**: constitution\n    82→- **Alternatives**:\n    83→  - \"construction\" (when emphasizing the tower construction method, 塔式构造)\n    84→  - \"structuration\" (to emphasize process over product)\n    85→- **Note**: This translates Husserl's \"Konstitution\" — the process by which objects and meanings are \"built up\" in consciousness through synthesis of experiences. The author uses 构造 in two senses: (1) methodological — the tower construction method for building category T from base category O; (2) phenomenological — how 形而上 concepts emerge as universal properties within subcategories of E. The second sense is Husserlian constitution. The author writes: \"形而上是基于现象之上的构造\" (the metaphysical is a construction upon phenomena). Use \"constitution\" for phenomenological contexts; \"construction\" for technical category-theoretic contexts. Context usually disambiguates.\n    86→\n    87→---\n    88→\n    89→## 第一实在 (dì yī shízài)\n    90→- **Main translation**: first reality\n    91→- **Alternatives**:\n    92→  - \"primary reality\" (acceptable variant)\n    93→  - \"the originary given\" (scholarly contexts to connect with Husserl's \"originäre Gegebenheit\")\n    94→  - \"First Reality\" (capitalized when used as proper name for the concept)\n    95→- **Note**: The author's term for the irreducible givenness of phenomena. This is the starting point from which all else is derived. Crucially, the author disclaims ontological intent (footnote 25): \"此处'第一实在'只是名称，而不是现象是否是本体论上具有实在地位的论断. 在实践中，对于人而言，现象是首先接触到的、不可绕过的.\" This is an epistemic priority, not a metaphysical claim about what \"really exists.\" It parallels Husserl's principle that originary intuition is the source of legitimacy, and Heidegger's point that Dasein is always already in-the-world. The term echoes but is distinct from \"primary qualities\" (Locke) or \"sense-data\" (logical positivism) — it is not a building block but an encompassing field. Preserve \"first\" rather than \"primary\" to match the author's numbering scheme (第〇, 第一, 第二).\n    96→\n    97→---\n    98→\n    99→## 第二实在 (dì èr shízài)\n   100→- **Main translation**: second reality\n   101→- **Alternatives**:\n   102→  - \"derived reality\" (emphasizing its derivation from first reality)\n   103→  - \"constituted reality\" (phenomenological contexts)\n   104→  - \"Second Reality\" (capitalized)\n   105→- **Note**: The constructed reality of objects, concepts, the \"objective world.\" The author explains: \"客观世界是基于现象而提出的一种模型\" (the objective world is a model proposed on the basis of phenomena). This corresponds to what Husserl calls the constituted object or the noematic correlate posited in the natural attitude. It is not \"false\" or \"illusory,\" but it is built upon and dependent on first reality. Every time we posit a metaphysical ground or ultimate reality, we create a second reality. This includes scientific models, conceptual frameworks, and everyday object-concepts (like \"this apple as a persisting thing\").\n   106→\n   107→---\n   108→\n   109→## 第〇实在 (dì líng shízài)\n   110→- **Main translation**: zeroth reality\n   111→- **Alternatives**:\n   112→  - \"ground reality\" (descriptive)\n   113→  - \"zeroth-order reality\" (formal)\n   114→  - \"Zeroth Reality\" (capitalized)\n   115→- **Note**: The putative reality \"behind\" or \"beneath\" phenomena — what traditional metaphysics seeks as ultimate ground. The author's radical claim: we can never access it, and whenever we name or discuss it, it immediately becomes 第二实在 (second reality, a construction). \"当我们提出第〇实在时，这个我们所提出的东西就是第二实在.\" This is stronger than Kant's Ding an sich (thing-in-itself), which at least functions as a regulative idea. The author suggests 第〇实在 is not merely unknowable but that any attempt to posit it converts it into a second reality. This echoes Heidegger's later reticence about \"Being\" and Wittgenstein's therapeutic dissolution of metaphysical pseudo-problems. Use \"zeroth\" to preserve the mathematical ordering and the sense of a would-be foundation that recedes as soon as we reach for it.\n   116→\n   117→---\n   118→\n   119→## 梦境 (mèngjìng)\n   120→- **Main translation**: dreamscape\n   121→- **Alternatives**:\n   122→  - \"lived dreamscape\" (emphasizing phenomenological dimension)\n   123→  - \"Jing\" (when梦境 is used synonymously with 境)\n   124→  - \"dream-境\" (hybrid, preserving both terms)\n   125→- **Note**: The author's initial poetic-metaphorical name for 境 before formalizing it as E. The author writes: \"我难以想出一个更加确切的名称。我用梦这样一个诗意的说法来指代他，但是他并不仅仅是指的我们在睡觉时时脑海中呈现的景象.\" It extends far beyond literal dreams to any structured experiential milieu in which meaning can arise — games, novels, rituals, daily life. The \"dream\" metaphor captures the way meanings are generated within an internally coherent structure, and the way we can be either absorbed in (沉醉) or lucid within (清醒) that structure. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the poetic register while indicating a phenomenal landscape. When 梦境 clearly refers to the formal structure, consider using \"Jing\" for consistency.\n   126→\n   127→---\n   128→\n   129→## 清醒 (qīngxǐng)\n   130→- **Main translation**: lucid\n   131→- **Alternatives**:\n   132→  - \"awake\" (acceptable, especially in \"awake within the dream\")\n   133→  - \"clear-minded\" (only if emphasizing clarity rather than structural awareness)\n   134→- **Note**: Describes the mode of inhabiting a 梦境 while aware that it is a constructed structure. The author explains: \"所谓清醒，即是说我们知道我们在梦境之中.\" This is lucidity: full engagement and investment while maintaining awareness of the frame. It parallels Husserl's phenomenological attitude (reflective awareness of constituting acts) but without the spectatorial distance — one remains invested. It also echoes the paradoxical state in lucid dreaming: awareness of dreaming while continuing to dream. \"Lucid\" captures this better than \"awake,\" which might suggest withdrawal. The 清醒的梦境 is the condition of 诗意 (the poetic).\n   135→\n   136→---\n   137→\n   138→## 沉醉 (chénzuì)\n   139→- **Main translation**: absorbed\n   140→- **Alternatives**:\n   141→  - \"intoxicated\" (literal, but may carry negative connotation)\n   142→  - \"immersed\" (neutral alternative)\n   143→  - \"entranced\" (poetic contexts)\n   144→- **Note**: The mode of inhabiting a 梦境 without awareness that it is a structure. \"所谓沉醉，即是说我们没有意识到我们在梦境中.\" This is the natural attitude: unreflective immersion where the framework is invisible and meanings appear as simply given rather than constituted. The author links this to 信念 and 信仰 (belief, faith) — when absorbed, purposes appear as ultimate givens (不动的动者, unmoved mover). \"Absorbed\" captures the phenomenological sense of being taken up in the experience without reflective distance, parallels Heidegger's \"Verfallen\" (falling/absorbed in the world), but without the negative judgment. \"Intoxicated\" is more literal but suggests impairment; \"absorbed\" is more neutral and closer to phenomenological usage.\n   145→\n   146→---\n   147→\n   148→## 诗意 (shīyì)\n   149→- **Main translation**: the poetic\n   150→- **Alternatives**:\n   151→  - \"poetic dwelling\" (to connect with Heidegger's \"dichterisch wohnen\")\n   152→  - \"poetic awareness\" (when emphasizing the mode of consciousness)\n   153→- **Note**: The author's term for the proper post-metaphysical stance toward meaning. It is the condition of 清醒的梦境 — being fully invested in a 境 while knowing it is constructed. The author writes: \"在我看来，在形而上学之后，面对意义应当是诗意的.\" This resonates with Heidegger's \"dichterisch wohnet der Mensch\" (poetically dwells the human), but arrives via a different route: through the exhaustion of metaphysics and recognition that meaning is constituted, not discovered. \"The poetic\" (substantive) captures the ontological/existential dimension better than \"poetry\" (genre) or \"poetic\" (adjective). It names a mode of being: engaged without being deceived, serious without being naive, playful without being trivial. This is the central existential concept of the collection, resolving the threat of nihilism not by finding new grounds but by transforming our relation to meaning itself.\n   154→\n   155→---\n   156→\n   157→## 恒常 (héngcháng)\n   158→- **Main translation**: constancy\n   159→- **Alternatives**:\n   160→  - \"permanence\" (emphasizing temporal persistence)\n   161→  - \"invariance\" (formal/mathematical contexts)\n   162→- **Note**: The core feature of 形而上 concepts. The author states: \"形而上的核心是恒常.\" Metaphysical thinking seeks constancy amid the flux of phenomena — the \"same\" object persisting through changes, the \"same\" pattern recurring. This corresponds to Husserl's concept of invariance in eidetic variation (what remains unchanged when we imaginatively vary all contingent features) and Heidegger's Beständigkeit (persistence). The author connects it to 同一 (identity) and 因果 (causality): \"因果即为时间上的同一\" (causality is identity across time). \"Constancy\" is preferable to \"permanence\" as it doesn't require absolute eternality, just relative stability that allows us to recognize recurrence. It is what gives us \"handles\" on phenomena, enabling meaningful action.\n   163→\n   164→---\n   165→\n   166→## 联想 (liánxiǎng)\n   167→- **Main translation**: association\n   168→- **Alternatives**:\n   169→  - \"associative connection\" (when emphasizing the relational structure)\n   170→  - \"associative morphism\" (technical category-theoretic contexts)\n   171→- **Note**: The morphisms (态射) connecting experiences within E. The author explains: \"𝔼中的态射，如前所述，被称之为联想. 例如说，我看到铅笔而想到钢笔，因而联想，做为一个态射，链接了铅笔和钢笔.\" This is not mere psychological association (Hume's habit-based connections), but has the phenomenological weight of Husserl's passive synthesis through association (Assoziation in \"Analysen zur passiven Synthesis\"). Associations are themselves experiences (elements of P), which is why E has tower structure — morphisms are also objects. They are the intentional threads connecting one experience to another, the way one experience \"reminds\" us of another, or one concept \"leads to\" another. Retain \"association\" for familiarity, but note in commentary that this is passive-synthetic association, not mere habit.\n   172→\n   173→---\n   174→\n   175→## 虚无 (xūwú)\n   176→- **Main translation**: nothingness\n   177→- **Alternatives**:\n   178→  - \"the void\" (when emphasizing absence/emptiness)\n   179→  - \"nihility\" (formal philosophical contexts)\n   180→- **Note**: Used primarily in discussions of 虚无主义 (nihilism). The author's position: nothingness is not a thing but a lack. \"虚无主义不是一种有、一种主义，而是一种无，一种缺位. 虚无主义不是被生产、创造出来的，正如虚空并不是被生产创造出来的，而是因为没有生产和创造了，这里什么都没有而已.\" Nihilism is what remains when the \"highest values\" (终极实在, ultimate reality) are lost. This parallels Heidegger's and Nietzsche's understanding of nihilism as the devaluation of values, the loss of meaning-grounds. \"Nothingness\" preserves the ontological weight. The author's project is to move through (后) nihilism, not by finding new grounds but by recognizing meaning as constituted within 境.\n   181→\n   182→---\n   183→\n   184→## 存在 (cúnzài)\n   185→- **Main translation**: existence / being\n   186→- **Alternatives**:\n   187→  - \"Being\" (capitalized, when discussing ontology or translating Heidegger's Sein)\n   188→  - \"existence\" (lowercase, when referring to particular existing things)\n   189→  - \"presence\" (when emphasizing being-present, Anwesenheit)\n   190→- **Note**: Context-dependent. In ordinary usage, 存在 means \"to exist.\" In philosophical contexts discussing the question of Being (as in Heidegger), use \"Being\" (capitalized). The author's framework is cautious about ontology — existence claims are bracketed in favor of phenomenal givenness. When the author says phenomena \"存在,\" this is better translated as \"are present/given\" rather than \"exist\" in a metaphysical sense. The author's position is closer to Heidegger's ontological difference (Sein vs. Seiendes) and the recognition that we cannot step outside phenomena to verify an independent existence. Use \"existence\" for ordinary contexts, \"Being\" for ontological discussions.\n   191→\n   192→---\n   193→\n   194→## 超越 (chāoyuè)\n   195→- **Main translation**: transcendence\n   196→- **Alternatives**:\n   197→  - \"transcending\" (verbal form, process)\n   198→  - \"going-beyond\" (descriptive)\n   199→- **Note**: The author uses 超越 to indicate going beyond a current domain or framework. Key passage: \"人类个体是无法立足于超越自身的东西的\" (a human individual cannot stand upon that which transcends itself). The author distinguishes immanent structures (within experience) from purported transcendent grounds (beyond experience). Traditional metaphysics seeks 超越 toward 第〇实在, but the author argues this is impossible — every posited transcendent ground becomes a constituted second reality. However, 超越 also appears in discussing how we can transcend current frameworks through practice: \"基于当下的自我，通过实践，超越当下的自我、构建新的自我.\" This is immanent transcendence, not escape from the phenomenal field but transformation within it. Distinguish: metaphysical transcendence (impossible) vs. practical self-transcendence (possible and necessary).\n   200→\n   201→---\n   202→\n   203→## 形而上 (xíng ér shàng)\n   204→- **Main translation**: the metaphysical\n   205→- **Alternatives**:\n   206→  - \"metaphysical concept\" (when referring to specific constructs)\n   207→  - \"meta-formation\" (emphasizing the constructive character)\n   208→  - \"above-form\" (literal, archaic, use sparingly)\n   209→- **Note**: Literally \"above form,\" the term translates \"metaphysics\" into Chinese via the Yijing phrase \"形而上者谓之道\" (that which is above form is called Dao). The author uses 形而上 to mean concepts or structures constituted upon phenomena that claim constancy/universality. These are second realities. Examples: the concept \"pen\" (笔) as universal property connecting all particular pen-experiences; moral concepts like 仁义礼. The author provides formal definition: \"一个形而上m是𝔼中的联想，且m在𝔼的某个子范畴中是范性质\" (a metaphysical m is an association in E, and m is a universal property in some subcategory of E). Use \"the metaphysical\" (substantive) to capture that these are objects/concepts, not merely an adjective. When discussing traditional metaphysics as a discipline, \"形而上学\" translates as \"metaphysics.\"\n   210→\n   211→---\n   212→\n   213→## 非理性 (fēi lǐxìng)\n   214→- **Main translation**: the non-rational\n   215→- **Alternatives**:\n   216→  - \"non-rational\" (adjective)\n   217→  - \"arational\" (to avoid negative connotation of \"irrational\")\n   218→  - \"extra-rational\" (emphasizing beyond-reason rather than opposed-to-reason)\n   219→- **Note**: Not \"irrational\" (which suggests contrary to reason), but \"non-rational\" — outside the domain of reason. The author's key insight: \"理性的目的必然要在理性之外，所以，理性的目的必然是非理性的\" (the purpose of reason must lie outside reason, therefore the purpose of reason is necessarily non-rational). Reason is a tool; its ends are not themselves rationally grounded. The pursuit of 恒常性 (constancy) and 形而上 (metaphysical concepts) is non-rational — not illegitimate, but not justifiable through reason alone. The author insists this non-rationality \"应当被承认\" (must be acknowledged). This parallels Heidegger's Existenzialen (existential structures not rationally chosen but given with Dasein), and Husserl's Urstiftung (primal establishment of meaning prior to rational justification). \"Non-rational\" is neutral; \"irrational\" is pejorative; \"arational\" is precise but less familiar.\n   220→\n   221→---\n   222→\n   223→## 我 (wǒ)\n   224→- **Main translation**: I\n   225→- **Alternatives**:\n   226→  - \"self\" (when used as object of reflection, e.g., \"understanding the 我\")\n   227→  - \"ego\" (avoid unless explicitly discussing Husserl's transcendental ego)\n   228→- **Note**: First-person pronoun. In philosophical contexts, the author discusses 我 as the subject of experience and the center of the phenomenal field. Important passage: \"'我'是那个感受，那个当你提到任何有关我的方面时，都会让我联想到的那个感受\" ('I' is that feeling, that feeling which any mention of any aspect of me will remind me of). The author constitutes the 我 phenomenologically as a universal property in a subcategory of E — the feeling that all my various experiences have in common. This avoids substantialist conceptions of self (a soul, a mental substance) and parallels Hume's bundle theory and phenomenological accounts of self as a structural feature of experience rather than a separate entity.

While 我 is the first-person subject, 自我 is the self as object of reflection or concern (as in 自我实现 \"self-realization\" or 自我认知 \"self-knowledge\"). The author discusses how the self is constituted and transformed: \"基于当下的自我，通过实践，超越当下的自我、构建新的自我\" (based on the present self, through practice, transcend the present self and construct a new self). This is the self as a project or achievement, not a given substance. Parallels Heidegger's distinction between existentiell (ontic self, particular) and existenzial (ontological structure of selfhood), though the author's usage is less technical. \"Self\" is appropriate; avoid \"ego\" unless context demands it.\n   238→\n   239→---\n   240→\n   241→## Additional Key Terms\n   242→\n   243→### P (𝔓)\n   244→- **Main translation**: P (retain letter)\n   245→- **Gloss**: \"the phenomenal field\" or \"the totality of phenomena\"\n   246→- **Note**: The author's symbol for the totality of phenomena/感受. \"P即是Phenomenon（现象），也是Physical World（物质世界），或者是Physics（物理法则）. 我用P以指代是任何在某理论中被认为是第一实在的东西.\" In practice, P denotes the complete phenomenal field.

Translations should signal this weight.\n   309→\n   310→2. **Respect independent achievement**: The author arrived at these positions independently, not through direct engagement with Western phenomenology. Avoid over-assimilating to Husserl/Heidegger; note resonances without claiming derivation.\n   311→\n   312→3. **Formal precision for category theory**: Mathematical terms (morphism, universal property, natural transformation) should use standard English mathematical terminology to ensure technical readers can follow the formalization.\n   313→\n   314→4. **Consistent terminology**: Once a translation choice is made for a key term, use it consistently throughout. Variations confuse readers and obscure structural parallels.\n   315→\n   316→5. **Context sensitivity**: Some terms (like 存在, 经验) have both ordinary and philosophical uses. Let context determine the appropriate translation level.\n   317→\n   318→6. **Preserve Chinese philosophical resonances where relevant**: Terms like 境 and 诗意 carry resonances from classical Chinese philosophy (意境, 境界, dichterisch wohnen). Acknowledge these in notes without allowing them to dominate the translation.\n   319→\n   320→7. **Avoid over-translation**: Do not add interpretive weight the original doesn't carry.

Through the \"access argument,\" truth and justification both reduce to belief in practice, making 知识 functionally equivalent to \"what each individual believes to be correct.\" This is more radical than post-Gettier externalism or internalism—it dissolves the knowledge/belief distinction entirely at the practical level. The term oscillates between the colloquial sense (what people call knowledge) and the technical sense (JTB), but the author's analysis shows this distinction collapses in epistemic practice. In the K1 categorical framework, knowledge is formalized as a category $(\\mathcal{E}_K)_t$ where objects are beliefs and morphisms are justification relations (which are themselves beliefs).\n    14→\n    15→---\n    16→\n    17→## 认知\n    18→- **Main translation**: cognition\n    19→- **Alternatives**:\n    20→  - \"cognitive structure\" (when referring to stable patterns)\n    21→  - \"epistemic framework\" (in formal contexts)\n    22→- **Note**: Used to denote the overall cognitive-epistemic architecture. Relates to foundationalism through the author's identification of \"stable structures\" ($S_E$) under categorical evolution—these may include a priori cognitive structures in some interpretations, but the author carefully avoids claiming they are a priori in a transcendental sense. Instead, stable structures are identified *descriptively* through their invariance under evolution, offering a naturalized alternative to Kantian categories. The term bridges psychology (cognitive science) and epistemology (theory of knowledge).\n    23→\n    24→---\n    25→\n    26→## 信念\n    27→- **Main translation**: belief\n    28→- **Alternatives**:\n    29→  - \"doxastic state\" (in technical epistemological contexts)\n    30→  - \"conviction\" (when emphasizing strength of commitment)\n    31→- **Note**: Central to the author's dissolution of JTB. Defined as \"a thought of taking something as true,\" inherently subjective and \"intrinsically irrelevant to objective truth.\" The author argues that all justification reduces to belief (belief-about-belief), and truth is never directly accessed—only phenomena, which must be \"digested\" into belief. This makes belief the only epistemically operative category. The Chinese 信念 carries stronger connotations of conviction than the English philosophical sense of \"belief,\" but in the formal K1 framework, objects in $(\\mathcal{E}_K)_t$ are beliefs in the weaker technical sense. Translation must preserve that knowledge is ultimately *just* belief in the author's system.\n    32→\n    33→---\n    34→\n    35→## 真理\n    36→- **Main translation**: truth\n    37→- **Alternatives**:\n    38→  - \"objective truth\" (when distinguishing from subjective belief)\n    39→  - \"correspondence with reality\" (in realist contexts the author critiques)\n    40→- **Note**: The author's treatment is deflationary and access-focused. \"Truth\" in the JTB formula refers to objective truth, but the author argues this is \"methodologically impossible\" to access—we only access phenomena, never truth directly. The \"truth condition is vacuous\" in practice. This is distinct from denying truth's existence (the author remains agnostic) but argues truth *does not enter into actual epistemic processes*. This resembles pragmatist deflation (truth as what works) but is more radical: truth is simply *inoperative* in knowledge formation. Not anti-realism (no ontological claim), but methodological phenomenalism applied to epistemology.\n    41→\n    42→---\n    43→\n    44→## 辩护 / 证成\n    45→- **Main translation**: justification\n    46→- **Alternatives**:\n    47→  - \"warrant\" (in contexts emphasizing epistemic entitlement)\n    48→  - \"verification relation\" (证实关系, when used as morphism in categorical framework)\n    49→- **Note**: The author's central thesis is that justification reduces to belief. All justification bases (phenomena, truth, prior justified beliefs) collapse into belief when we ask *how we access them*. Phenomena require \"digestion\" into thought; truth is accessed only through phenomena; prior justified beliefs are belief-about-belief. This creates Agrippa's trilemma: either circular justification (rejected via reductio involving babies having knowledge) or foundation in unjustified belief (accepted). In the K1 framework, 证实关系 are morphisms in $(\\mathcal{E}_K)_t$—the structural relations between beliefs that constitute epistemic architecture. This is neither pure foundationalism (no unjustified justifiers) nor coherentism (no mere coherence suffices), but a dissolution: justification *just is* belief-structure.\n    50→\n    51→---\n    52→\n    53→## 经验\n    54→- **Main translation**: experience\n    55→- **Alternatives**:\n    56→  - \"experiential content\" (when emphasizing phenomenal character)\n    57→  - \"empirical data\" (in contexts about empirical justification)\n    58→- **Note**: The author uses 经验 to bridge phenomena and cognition. In \"A Thought on Knowledge,\" empirical justification is analyzed: to use experience as a justification base, it must be \"digested\" into belief (the Bob examples). This dissolves the distinction between experience-based and belief-based justification. In the K1 strategy, $\\mathbb{E}_t$ (the total experiential category) includes all experience at time $t$, with a stable structure $S_E$ that may partially constitute a priori cognitive structures. Experience is not raw sense-data (rejected empiricism) but always already structured. Relates to reliabilism: even reliable experiential processes must manifest phenomenally to enter justification, neutralizing externalist moves.\n    59→\n    60→---\n    61→\n    62→## 现象\n    63→- **Main translation**: phenomenon / phenomena (plural)\n    64→- **Alternatives**:\n    65→  - \"appearance\" (emphasizing contrast with reality)\n    66→  - \"what is given in experience\" (phenomenological sense)\n    67→- **Note**: The epistemological *starting point*—\"what we experience or observe.\" The author explicitly states: \"in practice, we do not have direct access to truth; we have direct access to phenomena.\" This is the cornerstone of the \"access argument.\" 现象 functions as epistemological bedrock without ontological commitment (not claiming phenomena are \"more real\"—just methodologically primary). Translated \"phenomena\" (not \"phenomenal experience\") to preserve the phenomenological resonance. In the formal framework, $\\mathfrak{P}$ denotes the totality of phenomena, which are then structured into 境 ($\\mathcal{E}$). All justification bases bottom out in phenomena, which must be converted into belief to function epistemically. This is *practical* phenomenalism: whether or not things exist beyond phenomena, only phenomena can serve as starting points for actual justification.\n    68→\n    69→---\n    70→\n    71→## 感受\n    72→- **Main translation**: feeling / felt experience\n    73→- **Alternatives**:\n    74→  - \"qualitative experience\" (when emphasizing phenomenal character)\n    75→  - \"affective state\" (when emphasizing emotional dimension)\n    76→  - \"experiential component\" (in formal contexts)\n    77→- **Note**: Used interchangeably with \"体验\" to denote parts of phenomena. The author states: \"any part of P\" is a feeling or experience. This is closer to \"qualia\" in philosophy of mind, but without the ontological baggage. In the categorical framework, feelings/experiences are objects in $\\mathcal{E}$, and associations (联想) between them are morphisms. Epistemologically significant because feelings are the \"material\" from which beliefs and knowledge structures are constructed. When the author discusses introspection, feelings are what can be accessed through categorical structure—we can verify the framework by noting whether specific structural positions evoke specific feelings. This provides an empirical check on the formal epistemology.\n    78→\n    79→---\n    80→\n    81→## 境\n    82→- **Main translation**: Jing (preserve as transliterated technical term)\n    83→- **Alternatives**:\n    84→  - \"structured experiential field\" (when explanation is needed)\n    85→  - \"categorical sphere over phenomena\" (in technical contexts)\n    86→  - \"realm of experience\" (in less formal contexts)\n    87→- **Note**: The collection's central concept. Epistemologically, 境 is the *structured organization of phenomena*—the categorical architecture that makes knowledge possible. Defined as a category $\\mathcal{E}$ whose objects are selected from phenomena ($\\mathfrak{P}$) and whose morphisms are associations (联想, also part of phenomena). Crucially: morphisms are also objects (tower structure), making 境 self-referential. This is the *formal* answer to \"how is knowledge structured?\" Not the content of knowledge, but the *form* of epistemic organization. Different 境 can be constructed over the same phenomena (language-境, mathematics-境, knowledge-境), each revealing different stable structures. The term is untranslatable because its meaning is constituted by the entire theoretical framework—translation would require explaining the framework anyway, so preserve \"Jing\" and explicate.\n    88→\n    89→---\n    90→\n    91→## 联想\n    92→- **Main translation**: association\n    93→- **Alternatives**:\n    94→  - \"associative connection\" (when emphasizing relational character)\n    95→  - \"conceptual link\" (in knowledge contexts)\n    96→- **Note**: Morphisms in the categorical structure of 境. Epistemologically: the relations between experiential contents that constitute cognitive/epistemic structure. When \"I see a pencil and think of a pen,\" the association is the morphism linking pencil to pen in $\\mathcal{E}$. But association is also an object (a feeling of connection), making the structure tower-like. This formalizes how concepts are related in knowledge structures—not through logical entailment alone, but through experiential associations that can be phenomenologically verified. Associations ground both coherentist webs of belief and foundationalist inference chains (both reduce to associative structure in this framework). Translation must preserve that associations are both structural (morphisms) and experiential (objects).\n    97→\n    98→---\n    99→\n   100→## 构造\n   101→- **Main translation**: construction\n   102→- **Alternatives**:\n   103→  - \"structuration\" (when emphasizing process)\n   104→  - \"generative procedure\" (in contexts about how higher-order concepts arise)\n   105→- **Note**: Refers to the process by which higher-order metaphysical concepts are generated from lower-order elements through categorical tower-building. Epistemologically significant for understanding how abstract concepts are formed from experience. The author distinguishes two directions: bottom-up (abstraction from particular experiences to general concepts) and top-down (applying general concepts to structure particular experiences). Both are \"constructions\" but with different base points. Relates to genetic epistemology (how knowledge develops) and the distinction between discovery and justification. The author emphasizes: 境 is *not* constructed from phenomena (it's a structure *on* phenomena), but metaphysical concepts *within* 境 are constructed through categorical procedures. Essential for understanding how \"knowledge occurs\" (知识的发生) in the K1 framework.\n   106→\n   107→---\n   108→\n   109→## 恒常\n   110→- **Main translation**: constancy / the constant\n   111→- **Alternatives**:\n   112→  - \"invariance\" (in mathematical contexts)\n   113→  - \"permanence\" (emphasizing temporal aspect)\n   114→  - \"stability\" (when referring to stable structures)\n   115→- **Note**: The *epistemic demand* for stability that motivates all metaphysics. The author argues: \"The core of metaphysics is *constancy*—we need to find (pursue) a kind of constancy in changing phenomena, so that we can meaningfully act.\" This is the *non-rational* foundation of epistemology: we require constancy (same causes produce same effects, identity over time, reidentifiable objects) to have any epistemic traction on phenomena. Relates to Hume's problem of induction (constancy cannot be rationally justified) but the author *accepts* this non-rational basis rather than trying to solve it. The \"stable structures\" ($S_K$, $S_E$) in categorical evolution are formal expressions of constancy—what remains invariant as experience evolves. This shifts epistemology from seeking rational foundations to *describing* the constancies we inevitably construct.\n   116→\n   117→---\n   118→\n   119→## 第一实在\n   120→- **Main translation**: first reality / primary reality\n   121→- **Alternatives**:\n   122→  - \"first actuality\" (emphasizing metaphysical weight)\n   123→  - \"primary given\" (phenomenological contexts)\n   124→  - \"epistemological foundation\" (when emphasizing foundational role)\n   125→- **Note**: Phenomena as the *methodologically* (not ontologically) primary starting point for all knowledge. The author states: \"现象 itself is the unquestionable existence... therefore called 'first reality.'\" This is *not* a claim that phenomena are \"most real\" ontologically, but that they are epistemically unavoidable—\"we have no choice but to necessarily start from phenomena.\" Any postulated \"zeroth reality\" (reality-in-itself generating phenomena) becomes \"second reality\" (constructed interpretation) the moment we theorize it. This dissolves skeptical problems about external world: not by proving the external world exists, but by recognizing phenomena are our only possible starting point, making skepticism pragmatically inert. The \"first\" in \"first reality\" is methodological priority, not ontological rank.\n   126→\n   127→---\n   128→\n   129→## 第二实在\n   130→- **Main translation**: second reality\n   131→- **Alternatives**:\n   132→  - \"constructed reality\" (emphasizing interpretive aspect)\n   133→  - \"objective world model\" (when referring to physical object interpretation)\n   134→- **Note**: Our *interpretive constructions* over phenomena—the \"things\" we take phenomena to represent. Example: the image of an apple (phenomenon) is interpreted as representing a stable external object, \"the apple\" (second reality). This is where all metaphysics operates: constructing stable constancies over phenomenal flux. The \"objective world\" is second reality—constructed to explain first reality (phenomena), though we then *reverse* the explanatory direction and think second reality generates first reality. Epistemologically: all knowledge claims are about second reality (since phenomena are not \"claims\" but given), but justified only through first reality (phenomena are the only justification base). This explains why knowledge is always interpretively laden yet empirically constrained.\n   135→\n   136→---\n   137→\n   138→## 第〇实在\n   139→- **Main translation**: zeroth reality\n   140→- **Alternatives**:\n   141→  - \"reality-in-itself\" (Kantian contexts)\n   142→  - \"noumenal ground\" (emphasizing inaccessibility)\n   143→- **Note**: A hypothetical \"reality behind phenomena\" that, the author argues, is epistemologically inoperative. Any attempt to theorize zeroth reality converts it into second reality (interpretation). The author states: \"真正的道不可道不可名，无可讨论无法提出\" (true Dao cannot be spoken, cannot be named, cannot be discussed or proposed)—any zeroth reality that is discussed is already second reality. This dissolves the correspondence theory of truth: we cannot check our beliefs against reality-in-itself, only against phenomena. Not ontological anti-realism (the author doesn't deny reality-in-itself exists), but *methodological* phenomenalism: reality-in-itself, even if it exists, cannot enter into epistemology. The numbering is deliberate: we start from 1 (phenomena), construct 2 (interpretations), and can never reach 0 (pre-interpretive reality).\n   144→\n   145→---\n   146→\n   147→## 形而上学\n   148→- **Main translation**: metaphysics\n   149→- **Alternatives**:\n   150→  - \"meta-physics\" (when emphasizing etymological sense of \"beyond physics\")\n   151→  - \"theory of ultimate reality\" (in traditional contexts the author critiques)\n   152→- **Note**: The author distinguishes \"metaphysics\" (形而上学, the study of metaphysical concepts) from \"the metaphysical\" (形而上, metaphysical concepts themselves). Traditional metaphysics seeks \"ultimate reality\" but the author's \"post-metaphysics\" (后形而上学) recognizes all metaphysics as *constructions over phenomena*, not discoveries of pre-given reality. Epistemologically significant: metaphysical concepts function as universal properties (始对象/终对象) in categorical structures—they are the *stable points* toward which associations converge. For example, the concept \"pen\" is the terminal object in the sub-category of pen-like objects: all specific pens point to \"pen-in-general.\" This explains how abstract concepts function in knowledge: they are organizational nodes, not Platonic forms. Translation must preserve that the author is *not* rejecting metaphysics but reframing it descriptively.\n   153→\n   154→---\n   155→\n   156→## 虚无\n   157→- **Main translation**: nihility / the void\n   158→- **Alternatives**:\n   159→  - \"nihilism\" (when referring to the philosophical position)\n   160→  - \"absence\" (when emphasizing privative character)\n   161→  - \"meaninglessness\" (in value contexts)\n   162→- **Note**: The consequence of realizing that traditional metaphysics sought a \"zeroth reality\" that cannot be reached. The author states: \"Nihilism is not a something, not an -ism, but a lack, an absence.\" This is not a position to argue for but a *state* resulting from the collapse of metaphysical foundations when \"ultimate reality\" is recognized as inaccessible. Epistemologically: nihilism shows that the *goal* of traditional epistemology (knowledge of ultimate reality) is unattainable, but this doesn't make knowledge impossible—it shifts the question from \"do we have knowledge?\" to \"what do we do with beliefs in the absence of foundations?\" The author's post-metaphysical approach accepts the void and works within it, making practice (not foundation) primary.\n   163→\n   164→---\n   165→\n   166→## 理性\n   167→- **Main translation**: reason / rationality\n   168→- **Alternatives**:\n   169→  - \"rational faculty\" (when emphasizing cognitive capacity)\n   170→  - \"the rational\" (as noun, contrasted with non-rational)\n   171→- **Note**: The author makes a crucial argument: \"the goal of reason must lie outside reason, so the goal of reason is necessarily non-rational—that is, reason exists only as a tool.\" This has epistemological implications: rational justification cannot justify itself without circularity, so rationality's *value* is non-rationally grounded (in the non-rational demand for constancy, for effective action, for meaning). This resolves the regress problem differently than foundationalism or coherentism: the regress ends in non-rational commitment, which is *accepted* rather than disguised. The pursuit of knowledge is ultimately non-rational (we cannot rationally justify why knowledge matters), but this doesn't vitiate knowledge—it locates knowledge within the broader context of human non-rational aims.\n   172→\n   173→---\n   174→\n   175→## 非理性\n   176→- **Main translation**: the non-rational / non-rationality\n   177→- **Alternatives**:\n   178→  - \"arational\" (to avoid negative connotations of \"irrational\")\n   179→  - \"extra-rational\" (emphasizing it's beyond, not against, reason)\n   180→- **Note**: NOT \"irrational\" (against reason) but \"non-rational\" (outside reason's domain). The author identifies several non-rational foundations of epistemology: (1) the demand for constancy/metaphysics, (2) the need for self-realization through practice, (3) the goals that make knowledge valuable. This is the phenomenological/existential dimension of epistemology that analytic philosophy often brackets. The author states these non-rational elements \"should be acknowledged\" because they make rational activity possible and meaningful. Importantly: non-rational ≠ unjustifiable; it's unjustifiable *by reason*, but pragmatically justified by its role in making human life possible. This connects to naturalized epistemology: if we study how humans actually form knowledge, we find non-rational elements throughout.\n   181→\n   182→---\n   183→\n   184→## 先验\n   185→- **Main translation**: a priori\n   186→- **Alternatives**:\n   187→  - \"transcendental\" (in Kantian contexts)\n   188→  - \"prior to experience\" (when emphasizing temporal/logical priority)\n   189→- **Note**: The author's treatment is carefully agnostic. Stable structures $S_E$ preserved under evolution *might* include a priori elements if we identify them with the earliest structures $S_{E_c}$ at the first moment of cognitive life, \"independent of experience and sense-impressions.\" But the author emphasizes this is *descriptive*, not transcendental deduction. We identify stable structures empirically (by observing invariance), not by transcendental argument. This naturalizes the a priori: instead of \"necessary conditions of possible experience,\" we get \"evolutionarily stable structures in actual experience.\" Relates to Quine's naturalized epistemology (no first philosophy) but retains something like Kantian structure (cognitive frameworks that organize experience). The translation must preserve the author's agnosticism: these *might* be a priori, but we only access them as stable patterns.\n   190→\n   191→---\n   192→\n   193→## 综合\n   194→- **Main translation**: synthesis / synthetic\n   195→- **Alternatives**:\n   196→  - \"integration\" (emphasizing unification)\n   197→  - \"combination\" (in contexts about concept formation)\n   198→- **Note**: Used in contexts about how elements are combined to form higher-level structures. In epistemology, relates to the synthetic a priori (Kant) and the distinction between analytic and synthetic judgments. The author's framework suggests all knowledge is synthetic (constructed from experiential materials), including what we might call \"analytic\" truths (these are just highly stable constructions). In the categorical framework, synthesis corresponds to functorial mappings that preserve structure while combining or transforming elements. Not heavily theorized in the texts, but implicit in the tower-construction methodology: higher-order concepts synthesize lower-order ones while preserving associative structure.\n   199→\n   200→---\n   201→\n   202→## 分析\n   203→- **Main translation**: analysis / analytic\n   204→- **Alternatives**:\n   205→  - \"decomposition\" (when emphasizing breaking down)\n   206→  - \"conceptual analysis\" (in philosophical contexts)\n   207→- **Note**: The process of examining concepts by breaking them into components or examining their structure. The author's method is deeply analytic in practice: analyzing JTB into components, analyzing justification bases into access-modes, analyzing metaphysical concepts into categorical structures. But the author likely rejects the analytic/synthetic distinction as traditionally drawn (all judgments are ultimately grounded in synthetic experience). In formal contexts, \"analysis\" might refer to examining categorical structure—identifying objects, morphisms, universal properties. The \"Analysis Report\" itself exemplifies philosophical analysis: systematic examination of how epistemological concepts function in the author's framework.\n   208→\n   209→---\n   210→\n   211→## 掌握\n   212→- **Main translation**: grasp / to grasp / mastery\n   213→- **Alternatives**:\n   214→  - \"command\" (emphasizing full competence)\n   215→  - \"to have mastered\" (emphasizing achievement)\n   216→  - \"complete understanding\" (when specifically about comprehension)\n   217→- **Note**: Technical term in the K1 strategy's discussion of natural transformations. To \"grasp\" a formula $a$ means the natural transformation component $\\eta_a$ is the identity morphism—the evolution of the formula's structure aligns perfectly with one's experiential evolution, requiring no mediating confirmation process. The author states: \"当 $\\eta_a$ 是单位元时... 不需要经过任何额外思考来完成确认\" (when $\\eta_a$ is the identity... no additional thought is needed for confirmation). This is a *phenomenological* notion of knowledge: you \"grasp\" something when your experience of thinking through it matches your experience of the result directly, without gap. Relates to Bolzano's \"Vorstellung,\" intuitive understanding, and tacit knowledge—but formalized categorically. Not mere familiarity, but structural alignment.\n   218→\n   219→---\n   220→\n   221→## 理解\n   222→- **Main translation**: understanding / to understand\n   223→- **Alternatives**:\n   224→  - \"comprehension\" (emphasizing grasping meaning)\n   225→  - \"intelligibility\" (as noun, what makes something understandable)\n   226→- **Note**: More general than \"掌握.\" The author states: \"当我看到一个东西，并且认为你懂这个东西，这意味着这个东西的结构演化与你自身的经验演化之间确立了一个自然变换\" (when you see something and think you understand it, this means a natural transformation is established between the thing's structural evolution and your experiential evolution). Understanding is the *feeling* of $\\eta$ (the alignment between structure and experience), even if $\\eta$ is not the identity (not full grasp). You can understand something without fully grasping it—there's a gradient. This dissolves the understanding/explanation distinction: understanding IS the experiential alignment, not a separate mental act. Relates to hermeneutics (understanding as fusion of horizons) but formalized categorically: understanding is natural transformation.\n   227→\n   228→---\n   229→\n   230→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

However, this colloquial weight actually serves the author's argument: the absurd IS ridiculous because it represents a category error—seeking meaning externally when meaning is internally generated. The author's dissolution of absurdity through the cat-raising example fundamentally reframes Camus's confrontational stance, arguing that absurdity never had genuine ontological status but was merely an artifact of misdirected intentionality (向外寻求意义).\n     9→\n    10→## 虚无\n    11→- **Main translation**: the void / nothingness\n    12→- **Alternatives**:\n    13→  - \"nihility\" (when emphasizing the state of being)\n    14→  - \"emptiness\" (when Daoist/Buddhist resonances are prominent)\n    15→  - \"the nothing\" (Heideggerian contexts)\n    16→- **Note**: This term is far richer than English \"nothingness.\" 虚 (empty, void, insubstantial) resonates with Buddhist *śūnyatā* (空), while 无 (nothing, non-being) evokes the Daoist 无 that precedes 有 (being) in cosmogony. Together they create a term that is simultaneously negative (absence) and cosmologically resonant (the productive void). Unlike Nietzsche's *Nihilismus*, which carries historical and psychological weight from European Christianity and Platonism, 虚无 has Daoist associations with the fertile void from which things emerge. The author uses this term to describe what remains after the collapse of metaphysical frameworks—not as a new edifice but as the absence itself, the empty sky above the rubble.\n    17→\n    18→## 虚无主义\n    19→- **Main translation**: nihilism\n    20→- **Alternatives**:\n    21→  - \"the condition of nihility\" (when emphasizing it as a state rather than doctrine)\n    22→  - \"the void-stance\" (when distinguishing from Western historical nihilism)\n    23→- **Note**: The author makes a crucial distinction: nihilism is not a doctrine (主义 as \"ism\") but an absence (缺位, vacancy). \"Nihilism is not a kind of having, not an -ism, but a kind of absence... it's just that nothing was produced or created anymore, and there is nothing here.\" This maps onto Nietzsche's \"devaluation of the highest values\" (*Entwertung der obersten Werthe*) but arrives through structural rather than historical analysis. Where Nietzsche traces nihilism through Christianity and the ascetic ideal, the author shows why nihilism must occur given the structure of human cognition: all 形而上 (metaphysical constructs) are generated upward from phenomena but we mistake them as generating phenomena downward. When this inversion is recognized, the edifice collapses—not because of cultural forces but because of inherent cognitive structure.\n    24→\n    25→## 诗意\n    26→- **Main translation**: the poetic / poetic dwelling\n    27→- **Alternatives**:\n    28→  - \"poetic meaning\" (literal but less evocative)\n    29→  - \"*shiyi*\" (left untranslated, like *Dasein*)\n    30→  - \"poetic stance\" (when emphasizing the existential dimension)\n    31→- **Note**: This is the author's central positive contribution and the most challenging translation term. English \"poetic\" connotes aesthetic ornamentation, but 诗意 is an entire existential stance—a way of being in the world post-nihilism. It functions like Heidegger's *Dichtung* (poetry/poiesis) as world-disclosing activity, not mere versification. The poetic is characterized by lucid engagement with dreamscapes (清醒的梦境): one knows the meaning-structure is not grounded in ultimate reality, yet engages with it fully. This differs from Nietzsche's voluntaristic *amor fati*, Camus's heroic revolt, and Heidegger's quietistic *Gelassenheit*—it is active but not heroic, aware but not detached, constructive but not delusional. It is the most livable post-nihilistic philosophy, sustainable as everyday practice (like raising a cat) rather than requiring philosophical heroism.\n    32→\n    33→## 梦境\n    34→- **Main translation**: dreamscape\n    35→- **Alternatives**:\n    36→  - \"dream-realm\" (emphasizing spatial quality)\n    37→  - \"experiential environment\" (when technical clarity is needed)\n    38→  - \"meaning-world\" (when emphasizing the semantic dimension)\n    39→- **Note**: 境 (boundary, realm, environment) gives this term a spatial/environmental quality that \"dream\" alone lacks. The author explicitly states this is not just nocturnal dreaming but any meaning-environment where experience unfolds—game-worlds, narrative-worlds, ritual-spaces, life-projects. The dreamscape is where meaning and feeling become \"two sides of one body\" (两面一体). Crucially, dreamscapes can be either intoxicated (沉醉, unaware that it's a dreamscape) or lucid (清醒, aware yet fully engaged). This maps onto the existentialist problematic of authenticity/bad faith but reframes it: the issue is not moral failing but epistemological stance toward one's own meaning-structures.\n    40→\n    41→## 清醒\n    42→- **Main translation**: lucid / lucidity\n    43→- **Alternatives**:\n    44→  - \"awakened\" (when Buddhist resonances are relevant)\n    45→  - \"clear-headed\" (colloquial contexts)\n    46→  - \"aware\" (when emphasizing consciousness)\n    47→- **Note**: In the context of 清醒的梦境 (lucid dreamscape), this term deliberately evokes lucid dreaming—knowing you are dreaming while remaining in the dream and able to act within it. This is the author's version of authenticity: one knows one is in a dreamscape, knows the meaning-structure is not grounded in ultimate reality, yet engages with it fully. This resolves the perennial existentialist problem: how can one be both fully aware of contingency and fully committed to one's projects? The author's answer: one plays the game knowing it is a game, like engaging with a novel or performing a ritual. The lucid stance is contrasted with both沉醉 (intoxicated/unreflective engagement) and detachment—it requires wholehearted investment to obtain the core experience.\n    48→\n    49→## 沉醉\n    50→- **Main translation**: intoxicated / intoxication\n    51→- **Alternatives**:\n    52→  - \"immersed\" (less pejorative contexts)\n    53→  - \"entranced\" (emphasizing lack of critical distance)\n    54→  - \"absorbed unreflectively\" (when clarity is needed)\n    55→- **Note**: In 沉醉的梦境 (intoxicated dreamscape), one does not realize one is in a dreamscape. The dreamscape's purpose becomes the unquestioned logical origin—the unmoved mover. This corresponds to Sartre's *mauvaise foi* (bad faith) and the \"spirit of seriousness\" (*esprit de sérieux*)—treating contingent values as though they were given, necessary, and grounded in something absolute. However, the author is more generous than Sartre: intoxication is not a moral failing but the natural pre-nihilistic stance. Before nihilism, we had no reason to suspect we were in a dreamscape. This is closer to Heidegger's *das Man* (the \"they\")—not culpable but a structural feature of average everydayness. The author calls intoxicated stances 信念 (belief) or 信仰 (faith).\n    56→\n    57→## 超越\n    58→- **Main translation**: transcendence / to transcend\n    59→- **Alternatives**:\n    60→  - \"going-beyond\" (when emphasizing the movement)\n    61→  - \"surpass\" (in comparative contexts)\n    62→  - \"exceed\" (when boundaries are involved)\n    63→- **Note**: The author uses 超越 in multiple senses: (a) existential transcendence—going beyond the self (Sartre's *transcendance*); (b) metaphysical transcendence—going beyond phenomena to ultimate reality; (c) the quality of goals that reach outward beyond one's immanent experience. The cat-raising example is crucial: it has \"no transcendence whatsoever\" (没有超越性)—no one asks about the meaning of cat-raising because the meaning is entirely immanent to the activity. By contrast, entrepreneurial goals, even when internally generated, still have transcendent dimensions (reaching toward external outcomes). This distinction maps onto the difference between absorbed engagement (*Zuhandenheit*) and reflective pursuit of external goals.\n    64→\n    65→## 超越性\n    66→- **Main translation**: transcendence / transcendent quality\n    67→- **Alternatives**:\n    68→  - \"transcendent character\" (when emphasizing the property)\n    69→  - \"outward-reaching dimension\" (when contrasting with immanence)\n    70→- **Note**: The substantive form emphasizes the quality or property of transcending. Most important philosophically: the author argues that one's own death is transcendent (超越性) to oneself—therefore it is impossible to \"live toward death\" (向死而生) as Heidegger proposes. The death one lives toward is always one's own conception of death, shaped by one's metaphysical framework. This is a sharp critique of *Sein-zum-Tode* (Being-toward-death): Heidegger's privileging of death as the source of authenticity is itself an intoxicated dreamscape—it smuggles in a metaphysical valuation of death not warranted by phenomenological evidence. The implication: we cannot actively care about the purpose of life (because the purpose is not within life), therefore we can only care about the process of life and the feelings the process brings.\n    71→\n    72→## 意义\n    73→- **Main translation**: meaning / significance\n    74→- **Alternatives**:\n    75→  - \"significance\" (when emphasizing weight or importance)\n    76→  - \"sense\" (when emphasizing intelligibility)\n    77→  - \"purpose\" (when teleological dimension is primary)\n    78→- **Note**: Central to the author's argument is that meaning and feeling are \"two sides of one body\" (两面一体)—meaning IS the felt experience. This challenges intellectualist accounts of meaning (meaning as conceptual content) in favor of an experiential account (meaning as structured feeling). The author argues: \"I boldly surmise that meaning and purpose are in fact the surging of sensibility, the crystallization of experience, the turbulence of emotion—purpose and meaning are essentially experience and feeling.\" This connects to the phenomenological tradition (particularly Heidegger's *Befindlichkeit*, attunement) but is more radical: meaning cannot be separated from affect. The attempt to seek meaning externally (向外寻求意义) is the category error that generates absurdity. Meaning is internally generated (内在的意义) through engagement with dreamscapes.\n    79→\n    80→## 存在\n    81→- **Main translation**: existence / being\n    82→- **Alternatives**:\n    83→  - \"Being\" (when Heideggerian *Sein* is relevant)\n    84→  - \"existence\" (when emphasizing individual existence, *Existenz*)\n    85→  - \"to exist\" (verbal form)\n    86→- **Note**: In the Chinese philosophical tradition, 存在 carries less ontological weight than Western \"Being\" but more concreteness than abstract \"existence.\" The author's framework shifts attention from the question of Being (*Seinsfrage*) to the structure of experiential fields (境). This reflects the post-metaphysical stance: the question \"Why is there something rather than nothing?\" is itself a form of externalized meaning-seeking. The author's focus is on 已然存在 (already-existing)—\"I, as an already-existing I, necessarily have feelings that belong to me as me.\" This prioritizes facticity and thrownness over ontological speculation. Existence is treated as the given starting point (第一实在, First Reality = phenomena) from which all metaphysical constructs are generated, rather than as something requiring metaphysical ground.\n    87→\n    88→## 自由\n    89→- **Main translation**: freedom\n    90→- **Alternatives**:\n    91→  - \"liberty\" (political contexts)\n    92→  - \"free\" (adjectival/verbal forms)\n    93→- **Note**: While not extensively theorized in the essays read, freedom in the author's framework relates to the capacity to construct dreamscapes (境) and choose which dreamscapes to inhabit. This differs from Sartre's radical freedom (we are \"condemned to be free\") in that the author acknowledges we cannot abandon ALL dreamscapes—\"I, as an already-existing I, necessarily have feelings that belong to me as me.\" Some dreamscapes are unavoidable (已然存在的). Freedom is therefore not absolute but operates within the constraint of our already-existing affective structure. The coin-flip example illustrates freedom as self-transformation through境-construction: constructing a dreamscape (chance-as-decision) to move from a self trapped in indecision to a self that knows what it wants. Freedom is practical and processual—\"from the self back to the self\" (从自己回到自己).\n    94→\n    95→## 选择\n    96→- **Main translation**: choice\n    97→- **Alternatives**:\n    98→  - \"to choose\" (verbal)\n    99→  - \"decision\" (when emphasizing the act)\n   100→  - \"selection\" (when emphasizing options)\n   101→- **Note**: Related to freedom and境-construction. The author emphasizes that some dreamscapes are unavoidable (we cannot choose to have no feelings) while others are延续的 (continuable through choice). Choice is not the Kierkegaardian either/or that defines existence, nor Sartre's anguished confrontation with total responsibility. Instead, choice is embedded in the practical activity of境-construction and境-navigation. The coin-flip example shows choice as a process of self-discovery: we construct a decision-mechanism (the境 of chance) to reveal what we already want. This is choice not as ex nihilo creation but as excavation of already-existing preference through境-mediated practice.\n   102→\n   103→## 死亡\n   104→- **Main translation**: death\n   105→- **Alternatives**: None (straightforward term)\n   106→- **Note**: Brief but philosophically crucial treatment. The author argues: \"One's own death is transcendent (超越性) to oneself. Therefore it is impossible to 'live toward death' (向死而生).\" This directly challenges Heidegger's *Sein-zum-Tode* (Being-toward-death) as the fundamental structure of authentic existence. For Heidegger, confronting the possibility of my own impossibility individualizes me from *das Man* and throws me back upon my ownmost potentiality-for-Being. The author's objection: this \"death\" is always already a metaphysical construct (形而上)—death-as-understood, shaped by one's metaphysical framework, not death itself. Different frameworks produce different conceptions of death and different forms of \"Being-toward-death,\" none of which access death as such. Implication: Heidegger's privileging of death as the source of authenticity is itself an intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境). Conclusion: \"We cannot actively care about the purpose of life (because the purpose is not within life), therefore we can only care about the process of life, the feelings that the process brings.\" This shifts from teleological to processual existentialism.\n   107→\n   108→## 恒常\n   109→- **Main translation**: constancy / the constant\n   110→- **Alternatives**:\n   111→  - \"permanence\" (when emphasizing duration)\n   112→  - \"invariance\" (technical/mathematical contexts)\n   113→  - \"the unchanging\" (when contrasting with change)\n   114→- **Note**: Central to the author's account of metaphysics. \"The core of the metaphysical is *constancy* (恒常).\" We seek constancy in changing phenomena so we can meaningfully act. 恒常 provides \"assurance\" (保证): that the same phenomena will repeat. This maps onto traditional metaphysical categories of identity and causality (the author notes \"causality is temporal identity, so they are essentially the same thing\"). The progressive development of metaphysics (道→德→仁→义→礼) is a \"retreat\" (步步后退) from pursuit of ultimate reality toward pragmatic utility because the sought-for \"ultimate reality\" proves unreachable. When we recognize that metaphysical constructs are generated upward from phenomena (not downward from ultimate reality), the edifice collapses into nihilism. Post-nihilism, we recognize恒常 as constructed through境 rather than discovered in ultimate reality.\n   115→\n   116→## 境\n   117→- **Main translation**: *jing* (untranslated) / experiential field / meaning-environment\n   118→- **Alternatives**:\n   119→  - \"境-realm\" (when emphasizing spatial quality)\n   120→  - \"境-structure\" (when emphasizing formal properties)\n   121→  - \"境\" (romanized, like *Dasein*)\n   122→- **Note**: This is the master term of the entire philosophical collection. 境 means boundary, realm, state, condition, environment. The author uses it to denote the structured experiential field in which meaning arises. It has no single English equivalent. Given the term's centrality and conceptual uniqueness, recommend leaving it untranslated (romanized as *jing*) throughout translation, with extensive introduction explaining: 境 is where meaning and feeling coincide as \"two sides of one body,\" where experience unfolds, where metaphysical constructs (形而上) become operative. 境 can be lucid (清醒的境) or intoxicated (沉醉的境). We construct境 through practice, navigate among境, and cannot escape境 entirely because \"I, as already-existing, necessarily have feelings.\" The formal/category-theoretic work treats境 as structured objects with morphisms between them, making this concept mathematically precise in ways unprecedented in existential philosophy.\n   123→\n   124→## 感受\n   125→- **Main translation**: feeling / felt experience\n   126→- **Alternatives**:\n   127→  - \"sensation\" (when emphasizing sensory input)\n   128→  - \"affective experience\" (when theoretical precision is needed)\n   129→  - \"sense\" (verbal: to feel/sense)\n   130→- **Note**: The author distinguishes two senses: (1) received information, sensory stimulation; (2) the \"crystallization,\" \"surging,\" \"turbulence\" that these sensations arrive at and constitute. Both are感受. Crucially: \"feeling precedes the concept of self\" (感受是在我之概念之先前就已然存在的). This establishes the priority of affect over cognition, experience over concept. Feeling and meaning are \"two sides of one body\" (感受和意义即是两面一体)—meaning IS felt experience. This prevents the radical nihilist move of rejecting all meaning, because we cannot reject all feeling as long as we exist. The attempt to do so is虚妄 (delusional and arrogant). This echoes Heidegger's *Befindlichkeit* (attunement, how one finds oneself) as more primordial than cognition, but the author makes affect constitutive of meaning itself rather than merely disclosive of Being.\n   131→\n   132→## 非理性\n   133→- **Main translation**: non-rational / the non-rational\n   134→- **Alternatives**:\n   135→  - \"irrational\" (when emphasizing opposition to reason)\n   136→  - \"arational\" (when emphasizing independence from reason)\n   137→  - \"extra-rational\" (when emphasizing what exceeds reason)\n   138→- **Note**: Critical concept. \"Reason's purpose must necessarily lie outside reason, so reason's purpose must necessarily be non-rational—that is to say, reason exists only as a tool.\" Therefore: \"The pursuit of ultimate reality is itself non-rational (metaphysics itself is non-rational).\" The author argues this non-rationality should be **acknowledged** (承认), not condemned. The non-rational pursuit of constancy (恒常) is what enables meaningful practice—the overlap between ideal and phenomenon that allows self-realization. Deeper still: \"I think there is another layer beyond the pursuit of constancy: we need this 'practice.' This overlap between ideal and phenomenon is 'self-realization'—we see ourselves in phenomena, verify my existence, make phenomena become 'part of me.'\" This acknowledgment of the non-rational is central to post-metaphysical stance: we proceed knowing our meaning-construction is not rationally grounded in ultimate reality, yet we construct and engage anyway.\n   139→\n   140→## 我\n   141→- **Main translation**: I / the self / the I\n   142→- **Alternatives**:\n   143→  - \"self\" (when emphasizing personal identity)\n   144→  - \"ego\" (psychoanalytic contexts)\n   145→  - \"the subject\" (when emphasizing epistemological role)\n   146→- **Note**: Used phenomenologically rather than substantively. The author emphasizes \"I, as an already-existing I\" (我作为已然存在的我)—the self as always already thrown into affective experience, not as a transcendental ego or Cartesian cogito. The self is constituted through境: \"from the self back to the self\" (从自己回到自己) describes境-construction as a process of self-transformation and self-propulsion. The coin-flip example: moving from a self trapped in indecision to a self that knows what it wants through construction of a境. This is processual selfhood, constantly evolving through practice rather than fixed substance. Echoes Nietzsche's anti-essentialist view of the self and Heidegger's Dasein as always ahead-of-itself, but without Nietzsche's will-to-power or Heidegger's Being-toward-death as organizing principles.\n   147→\n   148→## 异化\n   149→- **Main translation**: alienation\n   150→- **Alternatives**:\n   151→  - \"estrangement\" (emphasizing subjective experience)\n   152→  - \"reification\" (when objects/processes become thing-like)\n   153→- **Note**: Used explicitly to reinterpret Camus's absurdity. The office worker feels absurd because his labor is alienated (异化)—he works for external purposes, not his own. \"When the source of meaning is externalized (外化), the off-tone appears. When it is internalized, it vanishes 'as if it had never come.'\" This connects Camus's cosmic absurdity directly to Marx's concept of alienation, making absurdity not a fundamental feature of the human condition but a symptom of alienated labor/life. The entrepreneur does not feel absurd because her goals are internally generated. The cat-raiser goes further—no transcendent goals at all, just immanent engagement. This Marxist analysis of absurdity is philosophically significant: it suggests the existentialist problematic itself arises from specific socio-economic conditions (alienated labor) rather than from the human condition as such.\n   154→\n   155→## 反叛\n   156→- **Main translation**: revolt / rebellion\n   157→- **Alternatives**:\n   158→  - \"rebellion\" (when emphasizing active resistance)\n   159→  - \"defiance\" (when emphasizing attitude)\n   160→- **Note**: References Camus's *révolte* in *The Myth of Sisyphus*. For Camus, revolt is \"the constant confrontation between man and his own obscurity\"—the heroic refusal to accept the absurd leads to happiness. The author reinterprets: \"Rebellion against the absurd is itself an internal goal (内在的意义), which is why it works. But it is unnecessarily dramatic.\" Camusian revolt already accomplishes what the author's诗意 aims at (internally generated meaning) but through dramatic confrontation rather than simple engagement. The cat-raiser has gone beyond revolt because there is nothing to revolt against—absurdity never had the occasion to arise. Revolt is thus revealed as one form of internally generated meaning, effective but more strenuous than necessary. The author's position: 诗意 is post-revolt in the same way it is post-nihilistic—it dissolves rather than confronts.\n   161→\n   162→## 形而上学\n   163→- **Main translation**: metaphysics\n   164→- **Alternatives**: None (standard philosophical term)\n   165→- **Note**: The author makes a crucial structural argument: metaphysics is generated **upward from phenomena** (自现象而产生), not downward from ultimate reality. The Chinese 形而上学 (study of what is above form) etymologically suggests metaphysics generates form, but the author inverts this: \"形而上 (the metaphysical) is in fact generated from form.\" All metaphysical constructs are abstractions and generalizations from phenomena, but we mistakenly understand them as generating phenomena. Example: 道→德→仁→义→礼 appears to flow downward (Dao generates all), but actually flows upward (concrete ritual behaviors are abstracted into仁, generalized into德, ultimately producing the concept of道). When this inversion is recognized, the metaphysical edifice collapses (虚无主义). The author distinguishes: **前形而上学** (pre-metaphysics, traditional/classical metaphysics before nihilism) pursues ultimate reality; **后形而上学** (post-metaphysics, after nihilism) recognizes all metaphysics as constructed from phenomena and returns metaphysics to practice. The author's post-metaphysical stance: formalize metaphysics as境-construction, acknowledge its non-rational basis, make it serve the overlap between ideal and phenomenon.\n   166→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

In philosophy of mind, 境 represents a category-theoretic model of phenomenal consciousness where objects are experiences (感受) and morphisms are associations (联想). It bridges structural functionalism (concepts defined by relational position) and phenomenology (grounded in lived experience). The term captures both a bounded cognitive space and a state of consciousness, similar to \"horizon of understanding\" in Husserlian phenomenology. Unlike mental states (too atomistic) or cognitive frames (too rigid), 境 emphasizes composability and evolution. In cognitive science terms, it models working memory's selective attention over a vast phenomenal field P, plus the associative network binding selected elements. The tower structure (塔式结构) of 境 provides a formal model for meta-cognition and higher-order thought.\n    17→\n    18→---\n    19→\n    20→## 联想 (lianxiang)\n    21→\n    22→- **Main translation**: association / cognitive morphism\n    23→- **Alternatives**:\n    24→  - \"association\" (standard cognitive science term)\n    25→  - \"cognitive morphism\" (technical category-theoretic usage)\n    26→  - \"linked-imagining\" (literal, captures 联 and 想)\n    27→  - \"spreading activation\" (neurocognitive process term)\n    28→  - \"associative link\" (network theory)\n    29→- **Note**: In this framework, 联想 as morphisms are the fundamental unit of cognition. Unlike classical associationism (Hume, Locke) which treats associations as mere pairings, the category-theoretic formulation adds composability (if A associates to B and B to C, there's a determinate A-to-C association) and identity (each experience associates to itself). This transforms \"association of ideas\" into a precise algebraic structure. In cognitive science, this relates to spreading activation in semantic networks, but with added structural constraints. The morphisms model not just which concepts co-activate, but how chains of thought compose lawfully. In philosophy of mind, this places relations between experiences as more fundamental than experiences themselves, resonating with William James's radical empiricism (relations are themselves experienced) and process philosophy. The choice makes 境 an arrows-only metacategory: the distinction between \"a concept\" and \"an association between concepts\" collapses at the fundamental level.\n    30→\n    31→---\n    32→\n    33→## 感受 (ganshou)\n    34→\n    35→- **Main translation**: lived experience / phenomenal experience\n    36→- **Alternatives**:\n    37→  - \"lived experience\" (Erlebnis in phenomenology, closest match)\n    38→  - \"feeling-experience\" (captures both feeling and undergoing)\n    39→  - \"qualitative experience\" (philosophy of mind standard)\n    40→  - \"sensation\" (too sensory-specific)\n    41→  - \"feeling\" (too affective)\n    42→  - \"experience\" (too generic)\n    43→- **Note**: 感受 implies both receptivity (感, sensing/receiving) and undergoing (受, bearing/suffering), capturing the passive and active dimensions of consciousness. In philosophy of mind, this corresponds to phenomenal character or qualia, but without commitments to intrinsic properties. The framework treats 感受 as objects in category 境, meaning they're defined structurally by associative position rather than by intrinsic nature. This sidesteps the hard problem of consciousness in its traditional form. In cognitive science, 感受 maps to phenomenal contents in global workspace theory or integrated information theory, but emphasizes experiential rather than computational characterization. The term bridges first-person phenomenology and third-person cognitive architecture: experiences are private qualia from within, but publicly characterized by structural position from without.\n    44→\n    45→---\n    46→\n    47→## 意识 (yishi)\n    48→\n    49→- **Main translation**: consciousness / awareness\n    50→- **Alternatives**:\n    51→  - \"consciousness\" (when referring to phenomenal consciousness)\n    52→  - \"awareness\" (when emphasizing attentional aspect)\n    53→  - \"cognition\" (when emphasizing cognitive processing, though see 认知)\n    54→- **Note**: In the framework, consciousness is not treated as a separate mystery but as the phenomenal field P from which 境 structures are constructed. This aligns with phenomenal consciousness (what-it's-like-ness) rather than access consciousness or self-consciousness per se. The approach is closer to Chalmers's distinction: consciousness is the \"first reality\" (第一实在), the given phenomenal field, while cognitive architecture 境 is constructed upon it. The framework avoids treating consciousness as a property that states have or lack, instead treating it as the ambient space within which cognitive structures exist. This resonates with neutral monism and Russellian monism in philosophy of mind. For cognitive science, this suggests consciousness is not generated by information processing but is the medium in which information-processing structures (associations, concepts) are embedded.\n    55→\n    56→---\n    57→\n    58→## 认知 (renzhi)\n    59→\n    60→- **Main translation**: cognition / cognitive structure\n    61→- **Alternatives**:\n    62→  - \"cognition\" (general usage)\n    63→  - \"cognitive structure\" (when emphasizing 境 architecture)\n    64→  - \"epistemic structure\" (when knowledge-focused)\n    65→  - \"understanding\" (in some contexts, see 理解)\n    66→- **Note**: The framework makes a crucial distinction: 意识 is the phenomenal field (consciousness), while 认知 is the category-theoretic structure 境 built upon it. Cognition is not computational symbol manipulation but structural organization of phenomenal experience via associations. This aligns with embodied cognition and enactivism: cognition emerges from organizing experience, not from abstract symbol processing. In philosophy of mind, this resolves the explanatory gap differently than functionalism: cognitive states are individuated by structural position in 境, not by causal-functional roles in physical systems. The stable structures S_E of 境 that persist through evolution are candidates for innate cognitive architecture (Kantian categories, Chomskyan deep structure, Spelke's core knowledge). Cognitive development is modeled as functor T: E_t → E_{t+1}, with learning as expansion of associative network while preserving stable structures.\n    67→\n    68→---\n    69→\n    70→## 体验 (tiyan)\n    71→\n    72→- **Main translation**: experience / experiential content\n    73→- **Alternatives**:\n    74→  - \"experience\" (general usage, slightly broader than 感受)\n    75→  - \"experiential content\" (emphasizing content aspect)\n    76→  - \"undergoing\" (emphasizing process)\n    77→  - \"phenomenal episode\" (technical)\n    78→- **Note**: 体验 and 感受 are used somewhat interchangeably for phenomenal contents, but 体验 emphasizes the durational or episodic character. In philosophy of mind, this maps to token experiences (particular phenomenal episodes) as opposed to experience types. The framework's innovation is treating 体验/感受 as both objects (things experienced) and morphisms (associative experiences are themselves experienced). This dual role is formalized in the arrows-only metacategory: the experience of \"pencil reminds me of pen\" is not ontologically different from the experience of \"pencil\" itself; both are objects, but one plays an identity-morphism role while the other plays a relational-morphism role. For cognitive science, this models how meta-cognitive experiences (thinking about thoughts) are not categorically different from first-order experiences, explaining the phenomenological continuity of consciousness across reflective levels.\n    79→\n    80→---\n    81→\n    82→## 经验 (jingyan)\n    83→\n    84→- **Main translation**: experience (broader sense) / empirical experience\n    85→- **Alternatives**:\n    86→  - \"experience\" (as opposed to innate or a priori)\n    87→  - \"empirical experience\" (emphasizing posteriority)\n    88→  - \"experiential history\" (diachronic emphasis)\n    89→- **Note**: While 体验/感受 refer to phenomenal contents as objects in 境, 经验 refers to accumulated experience over time or experience in the epistemological sense (a posteriori vs. a priori). In the framework's discussion of stable structures S_{E_c}, 经验 marks the boundary: structures present before any 经验 are candidates for a priori cognitive structures. This engages directly with nativism debates in cognitive science. For philosophy of mind, this connects to the Kantian project: what are the conditions of possibility for experience (经验) to occur? The framework suggests these conditions are stable structures S_E in the cognitive category. Note the Chinese philosophical resonance: 境界 (jing-jie, \"horizon/level of attainment\") is often about depth of 经验, paralleling the framework's idea that 境 evolves through experience.\n    90→\n    91→---\n    92→\n    93→## 构造 (gouzao)\n    94→\n    95→- **Main translation**: construction / structuring\n    96→- **Alternatives**:\n    97→  - \"construction\" (when emphasizing generative aspect)\n    98→  - \"structuring\" (when emphasizing organization)\n    99→  - \"composition\" (categorical sense)\n   100→  - \"synthesis\" (Kantian sense)\n   101→- **Note**: Critical term for understanding the framework's post-metaphysical stance. 境 is not discovered but constructed from P: we select certain experiences as objects and certain associations as morphisms. This is cognitive construction, not arbitrary construction. In philosophy of mind, this aligns with constructivism about mental representation: cognitive structures are not mirrors of external reality but organized responses to phenomenal input. The tower construction (塔式构造) formalizes how meta-cognitive levels are built up. The framework distinguishes descriptive vs. generative construction: 境 as structure is descriptive (describes how P is organized in experience) not generative (境 doesn't generate P). This parallels Kant: we construct empirical objects from phenomenal manifold, but don't construct the manifold itself. For cognitive science, this suggests developmental psychology is the study of construction processes: how children build increasingly complex E structures from phenomenal input.\n   102→\n   103→---\n   104→\n   105→## 我 (wo)\n   106→\n   107→- **Main translation**: self / I\n   108→- **Alternatives**:\n   109→  - \"self\" (philosophical usage)\n   110→  - \"I\" (first-person pronoun)\n   111→  - \"ego\" (psychoanalytic, usually avoid)\n   112→- **Note**: Profound implications for philosophy of mind. The framework defines \"我\" as a universal property (terminal object) in a subcategory of 境: \"我\" is that experience which all experiences \"about me\" associate to. This provides a structural, non-substantialist account of self. The self is not a Cartesian substance or a Humean bundle, but a functional node in the experiential network. This aligns with Buddhist Abhidharma analysis (self as conventional designation over aggregates) and with narrative self theories (Dennett, Schechtman). For cognitive science, this explains self-recognition: to recognize something as \"mine\" is for that experience to associate to the \"我\" terminal object. The framework can model how objects become part of the extended self (body, possessions, creations) by entering the \"我\" subcategory. This also explains disorders of self: disruptions to the \"我\" universal property (e.g., in schizophrenia, depersonalization). The dynamic nature of 境 means the self evolves: the \"我\" of E_t differs from the \"我\" of E_{t+1}, yet there's continuity through stable structures.\n   113→\n   114→---\n   115→\n   116→## 自我 (ziwo)\n   117→\n   118→- **Main translation**: self (reflexive/philosophical)\n   119→- **Alternatives**:\n   120→  - \"self\" (when emphasizing philosophical entity)\n   121→  - \"ego\" (in psychoanalytic contexts)\n   122→  - \"self-identity\"\n   123→- **Note**: While 我 is the first-person pronoun/experiencer, 自我 is the reflective, thematized self. In the framework's meta-cognitive tower structure, 自我 emerges at T_1 or higher: it's the experience of oneself as object of reflection. This maps to Higher-Order Thought theories: 自我 requires meta-representation (representing oneself as oneself). The framework can distinguish: (1) pre-reflective self (我 as lived experiencer), (2) reflective self (自我 as object of thought), (3) narrative self (the constructed life-story self). For cognitive science, this explains development of self-consciousness: children first have 我 (phenomenal perspective) before developing 自我 (self-concept), aligning with mirror self-recognition studies. The category-theoretic formulation allows formal analysis: 自我 is a higher-order object whose associations include meta-cognitive morphisms. This can model phenomena like self-deception (conflicts between 我-level and 自我-level associations) or self-cultivation (deliberately reconstructing the 自我 subcategory).\n   124→\n   125→---\n   126→\n   127→## 梦境 (mengjing)\n   128→\n   129→- **Main translation**: dreamscape / experiential milieu / meaning-field\n   130→- **Alternatives**:\n   131→  - \"experiential milieu\" (captures immersive context)\n   132→  - \"meaning-field\" (emphasizes semantic dimension)\n   133→  - \"horizon\" (phenomenological sense)\n   134→  - \"dreamscape\" (too literal, but preserves 境)\n   135→  - \"immersive context\" (functional description)\n   136→- **Note**: The author uses 梦境 not just for literal dreams but for structured environments in which meaning arises. In philosophy of mind, this is close to Heidegger's \"world\" (Welt): not a collection of objects but a meaning-totality in which things show up as significant. The framework treats 梦境 as a particular construction of 境, often deliberately constructed to evoke specific experiences. This is central to the \"poetic stance\" (诗意): entering a 梦境 while knowing it's constructed. For cognitive science, 梦境 models context-dependent processing: the same stimulus evokes different responses in different 梦境. This explains phenomena like frame effects, priming, and emotional context. The lucid-dream analogy is apt: in lucid dreaming, you know you're dreaming yet remain immersed; in poetic stance, you know the meaning-field is constructed yet fully engage. This has implications for therapy (constructing therapeutic 梦境), education (creating learning contexts as 梦境), and art (artworks as constructed 梦境 to evoke specific experiences).\n   137→\n   138→---\n   139→\n   140→## 清醒 (qingxing)\n   141→\n   142→- **Main translation**: lucid / lucid awareness / wakefulness\n   143→- **Alternatives**:\n   144→  - \"lucid\" (in lucid dreaming sense: aware while experiencing)\n   145→  - \"awakened\" (Buddhist resonance)\n   146→  - \"sober\" (as opposed to intoxicated by illusion)\n   147→  - \"clear-sighted\"\n   148→- **Note**: In the framework, 清醒 marks the post-nihilist condition: awareness that all 境 structures are constructed from phenomenal experience P, not discovered as pre-existing metaphysical truths. This is \"lucidity\" in the sense of lucid dreaming: knowing you're in a dream while continuing to dream. In philosophy of mind, this is a form of meta-cognitive awareness about the nature of cognition itself. It's not mere skepticism (doubting all structures) but sophisticated engagement (using structures while knowing their constructed nature). For cognitive science, 清醒 might correlate with metacognitive monitoring: the ability to track and evaluate one's own cognitive processes. The framework suggests 清醒 doesn't diminish engagement (you can be fully immersed in a film while knowing it's fictional) but changes its quality (from naive realism to poetic participation). This has implications for understanding contemplative practices: Buddhist \"awakening\" as recognizing the constructed nature of self and world, while continuing to function within those constructions.\n   149→\n   150→---\n   151→\n   152→## 沉醉 (chenzui)\n   153→\n   154→- **Main translation**: immersion / absorbed engagement / intoxication\n   155→- **Alternatives**:\n   156→  - \"immersion\" (experiential absorption)\n   157→  - \"flow\" (Csikszentmihalyi's sense)\n   158→  - \"enchantment\" (re-enchantment vs. disenchantment)\n   159→  - \"intoxication\" (literal meaning, captures loss of critical distance)\n   160→- **Note**: 沉醉 is full absorption in an experience or 境, without meta-awareness of its constructed nature. In pre-nihilist metaphysics, 沉醉 was the norm: people were immersed in meaning-systems taken as objective truths. Post-nihilism, 沉醉 becomes problematic (naive immersion) or impossible (disenchantment). The framework proposes 诗意 as transcending this binary: lucid immersion (清醒 + 沉醉). For philosophy of mind, 沉醉 relates to the phenomenology of absorption: loss of self-other distinction, time distortion, effortless attention. This occurs in flow states, aesthetic experience, contemplative states, or simply deep engagement with tasks. Cognitive science studies absorption via attentional mechanisms: 沉醉 involves suppression of metacognitive monitoring and executive control, allowing full cognitive resources to be dedicated to the experiential content. The framework's innovation is not rejecting 沉醉 (which is impossible and undesirable) but contextualizing it: engage fully (沉醉) while retaining awareness of construction (清醒), enabling deliberate construction of meaning-fields rather than passive reception.\n   161→\n   162→---\n   163→\n   164→## 篮子 (lanzi)\n   165→\n   166→- **Main translation**: basket (metaphor for cognitive accessibility)\n   167→- **Alternatives**:\n   168→  - \"basket\" (retain metaphor with explanatory note)\n   169→  - \"accessible domain\" (functional)\n   170→  - \"cognitive scope\" (abstract)\n   171→  - \"horizon of thinkability\" (phenomenological)\n   172→- **Note**: Crucial metaphor for cognitive closure and the boundary of thought. The basket is what has been \"placed\" (phenomenal contents that have entered P): we can only think about what's in the basket. In philosophy of mind, this engages directly with Colin McGinn's cognitive closure thesis: there may be facts forever inaccessible to human cognition, not from contingent limitations but from structural ones. The framework's innovation: while we cannot directly study the \"process of placing things in the basket\" (this is beyond thought, 超越), we can study what is in the basket and how its contents evolve. This transforms a metaphysical limit into an empirical research program. For cognitive science, the basket models the constraint that cognition operates on phenomenal given P: we can only cognize what appears in consciousness, and what appears is constrained by our sensory-cognitive architecture. This connects to Umwelt theory (von Uexküll): each species has its cognitive basket, its accessible phenomenal world. The framework suggests studying cognitive development as studying how the basket's contents expand: what processes allow new experiences to enter P? This is tractable even if the ultimate \"placing\" process is opaque.\n   173→\n   174→---\n   175→\n   176→## 恒常 (hengchang)\n   177→\n   178→- **Main translation**: constancy / invariance / permanence\n   179→- **Alternatives**:\n   180→  - \"constancy\" (emphasizing temporal stability)\n   181→  - \"invariance\" (mathematical/structural contexts)\n   182→  - \"permanence\" (metaphysical contexts)\n   183→  - \"persistence\" (diachronic emphasis)\n   184→- **Note**: The framework identifies 恒常 as the fundamental drive behind metaphysical thinking and concept formation. We seek constancy amid phenomenal flux: same object through time (identity), same cause producing same effect (causality), same type across instances (universals). In philosophy of mind, this connects to object permanence (Piaget), the binding problem (how transient neural activations constitute persistent objects), and the representational stability required for action planning. The framework's account: universal properties (terminal/initial objects in subcategories of 境) formalize 恒常. The concept \"pen\" is a terminal object all particular pens associate to, providing constancy across variations. For cognitive science, 恒常-seeking is a fundamental computational principle: the brain extracts invariants from sensory flux (Marr's primal sketch extracts edges, V4 extracts object constancy, hippocampus extracts episodic constancy). The framework contextualizes this: we seek 恒常 because without it, action becomes impossible (no reliable expectations). But post-nihilism recognizes 恒常 structures as constructed invariants, not discovered eternals. The stable structures S_E are those invariants that persist through cognitive evolution—candidates for either innate architecture or deeply learned schemas.\n   185→\n   186→---\n   187→\n   188→## 掌握 (zhangwo)\n   189→\n   190→- **Main translation**: mastery / command / grasping\n   191→- **Alternatives**:\n   192→  - \"mastery\" (emphasizing competence)\n   193→  - \"command\" (control sense)\n   194→  - \"grasping\" (understanding sense, literal \"holding in hand\")\n   195→  - \"grasp\" (epistemological sense)\n   196→- **Note**: Technical term in the natural transformation analysis. 掌握 occurs when η_a (the natural transformation linking internal cognitive processing to external formal structure) is an identity morphism: your internal derivation of \"1+1\" produces exactly the experience you get from seeing \"1+1=2,\" without discrepancy. This provides a phenomenological characterization of understanding with formal precision. In philosophy of mind, this engages with knowledge-that vs. knowledge-how distinction: 掌握 is not just knowing that 1+1=2 (propositional knowledge) nor just being able to compute (procedural knowledge), but experiencing the identity between internal process and external verification—a form of knowledge-by-acquaintance with the structure itself. For cognitive science, this models the feeling of knowing (FOK) or \"aha experience\": the qualitative sense of grasping something. The framework explains why some correct computations don't feel like mastery (when η_a ≠ identity) and why mastery persists across contexts (naturality condition ensures mastery survives structural transformations). This has pedagogical implications: teaching for 掌握 requires students to construct natural transformations, not just memorize facts or practice procedures.\n   197→\n   198→---\n   199→\n   200→## 理解 (lijie)\n   201→\n   202→- **Main translation**: understanding / comprehension\n   203→- **Alternatives**:\n   204→  - \"understanding\" (general epistemological sense)\n   205→  - \"comprehension\" (slightly more passive than 理解)\n   206→  - \"grasp\" (see 掌握, more active)\n   207→- **Note**: The framework provides a revolutionary account of 理解. Understanding is not correspondence between mind and world, but establishment of a natural transformation η between two functorial evolutions: cognitive evolution T and structural evolution T_M (or T_L for language). You understand \"1+1=2\" when there exists η such that thinking about \"1+1\" and seeing \"1+1=2\" align coherently. The naturality condition ensures this alignment is robust: it commutes with further cognitive operations. For philosophy of mind, this resolves debates about the nature of understanding without invoking mysterious \"grasping\" faculties or reducing to behavioral dispositions. Understanding is a phenomenologically accessible experience (the η morphism is an experience you can introspect) with precise structural characterization (naturality commutation). For cognitive science, this models comprehension as alignment between internal simulation and external structure, resonating with embodied simulation theories (Barsalou, Gallese) but formulated at an abstract, general level. The framework extends to language understanding: comprehending a sentence means constructing natural transformation between linguistic structure evolution and cognitive experience evolution. This explains misunderstanding (failure to construct η) and degrees of understanding (η as non-identity morphism vs. identity). Implications for AI: machine understanding would require constructing analogous natural transformations, not just mapping inputs to outputs.\n   208→\n   209→---\n   210→\n   211→## 现象 (xianxiang)\n   212→\n   213→- **Main translation**: phenomenon / phenomena / phenomenal given\n   214→- **Alternatives**:\n   215→  - \"phenomenon/phenomena\" (standard philosophical term)\n   216→  - \"phenomenal given\" (emphasizing givenness)\n   217→  - \"appearance\" (Kantian sense, but potentially misleading about reality-status)\n   218→  - \"experiential manifold\" (emphasizing multiplicity)\n   219→- **Note**: In the framework, 现象 is synonymous with P, the \"first reality\" (第一实在). This is a radical move in philosophy of mind: phenomenal consciousness is ontologically basic for cognition, not derivative from physical processes or neural computations. 现象 is what we start from, not what we explain. This aligns with neutral monism, Russellian monism, and phenomenological approaches. For cognitive science, this inverts the standard research program: instead of explaining how brain produces phenomenal consciousness, we study how cognitive structures (境) are constructed upon given phenomenal field P. The framework remains neutral on whether P is generated by brain, is identical to brain processes (identity theory), or is metaphysically independent—these are beyond the 境's scope. What matters for cognition is that P is epistemologically prior: all cognitive access is via phenomenal experience. This has methodological implications: introspection becomes a legitimate research tool (neurophenomenology), and first-person reports are data about P, not mere behavioral symptoms. The framework's innovation is showing how to build rigorous cognitive science on phenomenal basis using category theory as formal framework.\n   220→\n   221→---\n   222→\n   223→## 第一实在 (di yi shizai)\n   224→\n   225→- **Main translation**: first reality / primary reality / phenomenal reality\n   226→- **Alternatives**:\n   227→  - \"first reality\" (emphasizing primacy)\n   228→  - \"primary reality\" (emphasizing basicness)\n   229→  - \"phenomenal reality\" (emphasizing nature)\n   230→  - \"immediate givenness\" (phenomenological description)\n   231→- **Note**: The bedrock ontological commitment of the framework. 第一实在 (P, phenomenal experience) is what we indubitably start from; all else is constructed interpretation. This is not eliminativism about physical world—physical objects are 第二实在, constructed from phenomenal given—but a methodological and epistemic ordering. For philosophy of mind, this is a form of phenomenalism or idealism, but pragmatic rather than metaphysical: we privilege 现象 not because physical world doesn't exist, but because cognition necessarily operates on phenomenal interface. The framework borrows from Buddhist epistemology (direct perception as pramana) and phenomenology (Husserl's epoché brackets existence questions to focus on how things appear). For cognitive science, this means studying cognitive architecture as structures built upon phenomenal contents, using category theory to formalize how P gives rise to 境. This sidesteps the hard problem: rather than explaining why/how phenomenal consciousness exists, we take it as given and study its organization. The framework thereby inverts much cognitive science: not \"how does information processing generate consciousness?\" but \"how do conscious experiences organize into cognitive structures?\"\n   232→\n   233→---\n   234→\n   235→## 第二实在 (di er shizai)\n   236→\n   237→- **Main translation**: second reality / constructed reality / interpreted reality\n   238→- **Alternatives**:\n   239→  - \"second reality\" (maintaining ordinal structure)\n   240→  - \"constructed reality\" (emphasizing construction)\n   241→  - \"interpreted reality\" (emphasizing interpretation)\n   242→  - \"objective world model\" (functional description)\n   243→- **Note**: These are constructed interpretations of phenomenal experience P. Most centrally, the \"objective world\" of persisting objects is 第二实在: we construct permanent \"things\" (apples, tables, selves) from flux of phenomenal appearances. In philosophy of mind, this engages with direct vs. indirect realism debates. The framework's position is closer to indirect realism or sense-data theory, but without skeptical worries: 第二实在 constructions are not dubious inferences but necessary cognitive structures. For cognitive science, this models object representation: the visual system constructs object files (Kahneman) or object representations from retinal input flux. More broadly, all conceptual structures, theories, beliefs are 第二实在—constructed organizations of phenomenal base. The framework's innovation is using category theory to formalize construction: 第二实在 are structures (objects, morphisms, universal properties) in category 境 built from pool P. This allows rigorous study of construction processes without eliminating first-person phenomenology. Importantly, \"second\" doesn't mean derivative in value, only in epistemic/cognitive order: 第二实在 are essential for thought and action, but built upon 第一实在 foundation.\n   244→\n   245→---\n   246→\n   247→## 非理性 (feilixing)\n   248→\n   249→- **Main translation**: non-rational / arational / beyond reason\n   250→- **Alternatives**:\n   251→  - \"non-rational\" (outside reason's scope, not opposed to it)\n   252→  - \"arational\" (neither rational nor irrational)\n   253→  - \"beyond reason\" (transcendent but not nonsensical)\n   254→  - \"meta-rational\" (above rational domain)\n   255→- **Note**: Critical for understanding the framework's post-metaphysical stance. 非理性 acknowledges that reason's goals must come from beyond reason itself (analytic truth: reason is instrumental, goals are chosen). In philosophy of mind, this engages with Humean theories of motivation and decision theory. The framework recognizes our drive for 恒常 (constancy), for 境-construction, for meaning-making are 非理性—not irrational (contrary to reason) but arational (outside reason's domain). This is crucial for post-nihilism: acknowledging that pursuit of meaning is 非理性 doesn't invalidate it, but contextualizes it. For cognitive science, this connects to affective neuroscience and motivation research: goal-setting involves subcortical systems (amygdala, ventral striatum) that aren't \"rational\" in deliberative sense, yet provide necessary directionality for cognition. The framework's contribution: by acknowledging the 非理性 ground of rational cognition, we can study cognition without pretending to stand outside it or ground it in metaphysical absolutes. This enables \"post-metaphysical\" cognitive science: studying cognitive structures (rational) while acknowledging their roots in 非理性 drives (needs for constancy, meaning, understanding). Practical implication: philosophical problems involving ultimate grounds (why anything? what is the purpose?) are 非理性 and thus dissolve as cognitive-structural questions.\n   256→\n   257→---\n   258→\n   259→## 超越 (chaoyue)\n   260→\n   261→- **Main translation**: transcendence / beyond / exceeding\n   262→- **Alternatives**:\n   263→  - \"transcendence\" (philosophical sense of going beyond)\n   264→  - \"beyond\" (spatial metaphor)\n   265→  - \"exceeding\" (going past limits)\n   266→  - \"overcoming\" (Nietzschean sense)\n   267→- **Note**: The framework distinguishes two senses of 超越. (1) Static transcendence: what's permanently beyond thought's reach (the \"placing in basket\" process—how contents enter phenomenal field P). This is 超越 in mystical sense: forever inaccessible. (2) Dynamic transcendence: \"tomorrow's 境 differs from today's 境.\" Cognitive evolution means we continually transcend current structures without reaching absolute transcendence. For philosophy of mind, this engages with cognitive closure debates (McGinn) and phenomenological horizons (Husserl: every perception has a horizon of possible further perceptions). The framework's move: static 超越 (ultimate grounds, thing-in-itself) is acknowledged but bracketed as empirically sterile; dynamic 超越 (cognitive development, 境 evolution) becomes the tractable research program. For cognitive science, this models developmental psychology and learning: acquiring new concepts, new languages, new expertise transcends previous cognitive limits while remaining within human cognition's scope. The framework can formalize this: evolution functor T: E_t → E_{t+1} is the mechanism of dynamic transcendence, while the stable structures S_E it preserves ensure continuity through change. Implications: education and therapy are technologies of 超越, enabling construction of new 境 structures that transcend current limitations. The framework thereby makes 超越 operational rather than mystical.\n   268→\n   269→---\n   270→\n   271→## 范畴 (fanchou)\n   272→\n   273→- **Main translation**: category (category theory) / categories (Kantian sense)\n   274→- **Alternatives**:\n   275→  - \"category\" (mathematical category theory sense)\n   276→  - \"categories\" (Kantian categories of understanding)\n   277→  - \"schema\" (cognitive science, when appropriate)\n   278→- **Note**: Critical ambiguity that the framework exploits. In technical usage, 范畴 refers to mathematical categories (objects + morphisms). The framework models 境 as a category where objects are experiences and morphisms are associations. But the term resonates with Kant's categories of understanding—innate cognitive structures that make experience possible. The framework suggests these are related: Kantian categories might be formalized as stable structures S_E in the experiential category, specifically the portions present from earliest cognition S_{E_c}. For philosophy of mind, this provides a bridge between formal mathematical structure and traditional epistemology. For cognitive science, this suggests category theory might formalize innate cognitive architecture. The framework can model domain-specific knowledge (E_L for language, E_M for mathematics) as subcategories with inclusion functors, and study their stable structures (analogous to Chomsky's Universal Grammar or Spelke's core knowledge). The dual meaning is productive: mathematical categories provide formal tools to study cognitive categories (structured knowledge domains). The framework's use of category theory is motivated by cognition's compositional, hierarchical nature: thoughts compose (associations compose), have meta-levels (tower structure), and exhibit universal properties (concepts as terminal objects).\n   279→\n   280→---\n   281→\n   282→## 态射 / 箭头 (taishe / jiantou)\n   283→\n   284→- **Main translation**: morphism / arrow\n   285→- **Alternatives**:\n   286→  - \"morphism\" (standard category theory term)\n   287→  - \"arrow\" (alternative category theory term, more intuitive)\n   288→  - \"mapping\" (less technical)\n   289→  - \"transformation\" (emphasizing change aspect)\n   290→- **Note**: In category theory, morphisms/arrows are structure-preserving maps between objects. In the 境 framework, morphisms are associations (联想) between experiences. This is profound for philosophy of mind: mental relations are as ontologically basic as mental contents. In fact, in the arrows-only formulation, there's no fundamental distinction: objects are identity morphisms. This resonates with process philosophy (Whitehead: relations are as real as relata) and radical empiricism (James: relations are experienced). For cognitive science, this models associative links in semantic networks, but with added structure: morphisms compose (if A→B and B→C, then A→C exists and is determinate), have identities (A→A), and exhibit universal properties (some experiences/concepts are terminal/initial objects all others map to/from). The framework's use of morphisms formalizes spreading activation and cognitive binding. The tower structure makes morphisms-between-morphisms fundamental to meta-cognition: thinking about associations is represented by morphisms in T_1 whose domain/codomain are morphisms in T_0. This provides category-theoretic formalization of Higher-Order Thought theories. Importantly, morphisms are themselves experiences (感受): the association \"pencil reminds me of pen\" is something felt/experienced, not an abstract relation.\n   291→\n   292→---\n   293→\n   294→## 函子 (hanzi)\n   295→\n   296→- **Main translation**: functor\n   297→- **Alternatives**:\n   298→  - \"functor\" (standard category theory term, retain in technical contexts)\n   299→  - \"structural mapping\" (less technical explanation)\n   300→  - \"transformation\" (between categories, contextual)\n   301→- **Note**: Functors map categories to categories while preserving structure (morphisms, composition, identity). In the framework, functors play several cognitive roles: (1) Evolution functor T: E_t → E_{t+1} models cognitive development/change. (2) Inclusion functors F_{E,L}: E_L → E embed subcategories (language, math) into overall cognition. (3) Translation functors F_{L→M}: E_L → E_M map between domains. For philosophy of mind, functors formalize how knowledge transfers across domains, how cognitive structures evolve while preserving invariants, and how specialized cognitive systems relate to general cognition. For cognitive science, this models domain generality vs. domain specificity: specialized cognitive modules (Fodor) vs. general-purpose architecture. The framework allows both: subcategories E_L, E_M are domain-specific, but functors connect them and track commonalities. The stable structures S_E preserved by evolution functor T are candidates for domain-general cognitive architecture. Functors also model learning transfer: if student masters concept in E_M (math), can it transfer to E_L (language) or E (general reasoning)? This requires functor F_{M→E} that preserves relevant structure. The naturality condition on functors (natural transformations) formalizes what it means for learning to transfer properly. Pedagogical implication: teaching should construct functors between domains, not just impart domain-specific knowledge.\n   302→\n   303→---\n   304→\n   305→## 自然变换 (ziran bianhua)\n   306→\n   307→- **Main translation**: natural transformation\n   308→- **Alternatives**:\n   309→  - \"natural transformation\" (standard category theory term, preserve in technical contexts)\n   310→  - \"coherent alignment\" (conceptual explanation)\n   311→  - \"structural correspondence\" (emphasizing correspondence)\n   312→- **Note**: Perhaps the framework's most innovative contribution. A natural transformation η between functors F and G assigns to each object a morphism η_a: F(a) → G(a), commuting with all morphisms. The framework models understanding (理解) as natural transformation between cognitive evolution and external structure evolution. You understand \"1+1=2\" when your internal thought process (T((F_{E,M})_t(1+1))) aligns with the external mathematical derivation ((F_{E,M})_{t+1}(T_M(1+1→1+1=2))) via experience η that \"confirms\" the alignment. For philosophy of mind, this is a phenomenological characterization of understanding with mathematical precision: understanding is an experience (η_a is a morphism in 境, hence an experience) of alignment between internal and external processes. The naturality condition ensures understanding is robust: it persists through further cognitive operations. When η_a is identity morphism, this is mastery (掌握): no gap between your derivation and the truth. For cognitive science, this formalizes comprehension as simulation-alignment (your cognitive simulation of a process matches the actual process). This explains why some memorized facts don't feel understood (η_a ≠ identity) and why understanding enables transfer (naturality ensures alignment extends to new contexts). Profound implication: meaning is neither in text/world nor in mind, but in the natural transformation between them. This dissolves nature-of-meaning debates (use theory vs. reference theory) by making meaning a relational achievement.\n   313→\n   314→---\n   315→\n   316→## 第一实在 vs 第二实在 vs 第〇实在\n   317→\n   318→- **Main translation**: First Reality vs. Second Reality vs. Zeroth Reality\n   319→- **Note on ordering**: The framework uses a deliberate numerical ordering to establish epistemic and cognitive priority, not ontological priority.

This is what pre-nihilist metaphysics sought: the ultimate substrate that generates phenomena. The framework's radical claim: 第〇实在 doesn't exist for us—not because it doesn't exist ontologically, but because whenever we attempt to posit it, what we actually create is 第二实在 (an interpretation of 第一实在). The moment we think about \"ultimate reality,\" we've already constructed a concept from phenomenal experience. This is analogous to Kant's noumenon or Laozi's \"dao that can be spoken is not the eternal dao.\"\n   321→  - **第一实在 (di yi shizai)**: \"First Reality\" = phenomenal experience (P).

Instead of explaining how physical (第〇实在?) generates mental (第一实在), we study how mental (第一实在) gets structured into cognitive models (第二实在), remaining agnostic about ultimate ground (第〇实在).

For Kant, phenomena are always already constituted by the forms of intuition (space/time) and categories of understanding. The author's 现象 refers to raw experiential content prior to any intellectual processing—closer to the \"manifold of intuition\" before synthesis, or to Husserlian *Erlebnis* (lived experience). The author explicitly identifies 现象 as 第一实在 (First Reality), the indubitable starting point of all cognition. This is the empirical given, but not yet structured as Kantian appearance.

The ordinal \"first\" is temporal/epistemic (what we encounter first), NOT ontological (what exists first). This parallels Kant's \"empirical reality\" (*empirische Realität*) but with crucial difference: Kant's empirical reality is already transcendentally constituted, whereas the author's 第一实在 precedes all constitution. The footnote explicitly states this is a *name*, not an ontological claim. The author's insistence that 现象 is 无可怀疑 (indubitable) echoes Kant's transcendental argument that all cognition begins with experience.

The mathematical/ordinal \"zeroth\" evokes something \"prior to\" First Reality in logical/ontological order. Critically, the author argues: \"对于我们而言，并不存在第〇实在，而只存在第二实在。当我们提出第〇实在时，这个我们所提出的东西就是第二实在\" (For us, Zeroth Reality does not exist; only Second Reality exists. When we propose Zeroth Reality, what we propose is already Second Reality). This precisely mirrors Kant's doctrine that the thing-in-itself is a *Grenzbegriff* (limiting concept, B310-311)—it cannot be known, and any determination of it transforms it into phenomenon. The Daoist parallel: 真正的道不可道不可名 (the true Dao cannot be spoken or named). The post-metaphysical twist: the author performs a \"disenchantment\" (祛魅) that goes beyond Kant—the very *desire* for 第〇实在 is recognized as non-rational (非理性), whereas Kant treats the noumenon as a necessary thought of reason.\n    35→\n    36→---\n    37→\n    38→## 第二实在 (dì èr shízài)\n    39→- **Main translation**: Second Reality\n    40→- **Alternatives**:\n    41→  - \"Constructed reality\" when emphasizing the generative process\n    42→  - \"Conceptual reality\" in epistemological contexts\n    43→  - \"Metaphysical constructs\" when referring to multiple instances\n    44→- **Note**: The reality we construct from 第一实在—all our concepts, theories, and structured understanding of phenomena. This corresponds roughly to Kant's \"object of experience as constituted by the understanding.\" In the Daoist example: 道德仁义礼 as articulated concepts are all 第二实在, constructed upward from 现象 but *understood* (in pre-metaphysics) as if they descended from 第〇实在. The key post-metaphysical recognition is that all 形而上 (the metaphysical) is 第二实在—constructed from phenomena, not grounding them. This parallels the \"Copernican revolution\" in Kant's CPR, where objects must conform to our cognition rather than vice versa. However, the author goes further: even the noumenon, once articulated, becomes Second Reality.\n    45→\n    46→---\n    47→\n    48→## 形而上学 (xíng ér shàng xué)\n    49→- **Main translation**: Metaphysics\n    50→- **Alternatives**:\n    51→  - \"Metaphysical inquiry\" to emphasize the disciplinary aspect\n    52→  - \"Metaphysical studies\" in academic contexts\n    53→- **Note**: The discipline/study of 形而上 (the metaphysical). The Chinese etymology from *Yijing* 系辞传: \"形而上者謂之道，形而下者謂之器\" (What is above form is called Dao; what is below form is called implements). Standard translation of \"metaphysics\" (from Greek *meta ta physika*). The author carefully distinguishes 形而上学 (the study) from 形而上 (metaphysical constructs themselves). Western metaphysics seeks *ultimate reality* (终极实在); Chinese thought more often operates *within* given 形而上 frameworks to reach 至善 (supreme good) and cultivate 圣人 (the sage). The author's critical move: all metaphysics rests on the non-rational (非理性) pursuit of constancy (恒常). This genealogy is closer to Nietzsche than Kant, though the framework remains transcendental in structure.\n    54→\n    55→---\n    56→\n    57→## 形而上 (xíng ér shàng)\n    58→- **Main translation**: The metaphysical / metaphysical construct(s)\n    59→- **Alternatives**:\n    60→  - \"Metaphysical structure\" when referring to systematic constructions\n    61→  - \"Supra-phenomenal\" to emphasize the beyond-phenomenon aspect\n    62→  - \"Abstract concept\" in simpler contexts\n    63→- **Note**: A property or construct that stands \"above\" phenomena—any concept, category, or structure abstracted from 现象. The author reinterprets 形 as 现象 (phenomenon) rather than the traditional reading, making 形而上 literally \"that which is above/upon phenomena.\" This is NOT ontologically prior but epistemically derivative—built UP from phenomena, though traditionally *understood* as descending DOWN to generate phenomena. The author identifies three types: 第〇种 (recognition of repeated patterns), 第一种 (predictive generalizations), 第二种 (abstraction into concepts). The core of all 形而上 is 恒常 (constancy)—the pursuit of invariant structure amid change. In Kantian terms, this includes both empirical concepts and pure concepts (categories), but the author's framework does not distinguish them as sharply. The author's universal property (泛性质) definition from category theory: 形而上 is a universal property in a subcategory of E (境).\n    64→\n    65→---\n    66→\n    67→## 后形而上学 (hòu xíng ér shàng xué)\n    68→- **Main translation**: Post-metaphysics\n    69→- **Alternatives**:\n    70→  - \"Post-metaphysical thought\" when referring to the approach\n    71→  - \"After metaphysics\" for literal emphasis\n    72→- **Note**: Metaphysics *after* nihilism—after the recognition that 第〇实在 has no special epistemic privilege and that the pursuit of ultimate ground is non-rational. This is NOT anti-metaphysical or a rejection of 形而上; rather, it is metaphysics with explicit recognition that all metaphysical constructs are built from 现象 upward, not given from above. The key moves: (1) disenchantment (祛魅) of 第〇实在; (2) recognition of the non-rational (非理性) drive underlying metaphysical construction; (3) acknowledgment that 现象 occupies the structurally primary position. The method is 实践 (practice)—the \"overlap of ideal and phenomenon\" (理想和现象之重叠). This parallels Kant's limitation of metaphysics in CPR but goes further: Kant cordons off noumena while maintaining their regulative function; the author accepts the non-rationality at the foundation and builds post-metaphysics as deliberate, acknowledged construction. Closer to Nietzsche's \"gay science\" or pragmatist/constructivist approaches, but retaining transcendental structure.\n    73→\n    74→---\n    75→\n    76→## 先验 (xiān yàn)\n    77→- **Main translation**: A priori / transcendental (context-dependent)\n    78→- **Alternatives**:\n    79→  - \"A priori\" when referring to knowledge independent of experience\n    80→  - \"Transcendental\" when referring to conditions of possibility of experience\n    81→  - Keep Chinese term with gloss in highly technical passages\n    82→- **Note**: Standard translation of Kant's *a priori* (prior to experience) and *transzendental* (concerning conditions of possibility). In the K1 strategy essay, the author writes: \"如果你认为这一时刻是某种E_t首次出现的时刻...则你可以将这种稳定结构当中的这一部分认定为'先天'\" (If you consider this the moment of E_t's first appearance, independent of experience, you may identify this part of the stable structure as \"a priori\"). The author's S_E (stable structure preserved under evolution functor T) plays the role of Kantian a priori structures—forms of intuition and categories—but the author leaves S_E formally unspecified and proposes to discover it empirically through \"philosophical experiments.\" This is methodologically post-Kantian: the *form* of synthetic a priori knowledge, but the *content* left to empirical investigation. The author deliberately withholds Kant's strong modal claims while retaining the structural insight.\n    83→\n    84→---\n    85→\n    86→## 范畴 (fànchóu)\n    87→- **Main translation**: Category (context determines mathematical or philosophical sense)\n    88→- **Alternatives**:\n    89→  - \"Category\" (mathematical category theory) in technical passages\n    90→  - \"Category of understanding\" when explicitly invoking Kant\n    91→  - Distinguish by capitalization or context\n    92→- **Note**: Dual usage: (1) Philosophical—Kant's *Kategorien*, the pure concepts of understanding that structure experience (substance, causality, etc.); (2) Mathematical—category theory (范畴论), the formal language the author uses to describe the structure of 境. The author's major innovation: replacing Kant's table of twelve categories (derived from logical forms of judgment) with category-theoretic structures. Universal properties (泛性质) replace Kantian categories; functors replace schematism; natural transformations replace synthetic unity of apperception. This is structure-first rather than logic-first. The advantage: formal precision and generativity beyond Kant's discursive formulations. The shift: from Kant's fixed categories to dynamically evolving cognitive structures described by functors.\n    93→\n    94→---\n    95→\n    96→## 构造 (gòuzào)\n    97→- **Main translation**: Construction / constitute (verb: construct)\n    98→- **Alternatives**:\n    99→  - \"Constitution\" when emphasizing transcendental constitution\n   100→  - \"Building\" in simpler contexts\n   101→  - \"Synthesis\" when the Kantian parallel is explicit\n   102→- **Note**: The process by which 第二实在 is built up from 第一实在; the generation of structured 境 from raw phenomena. Parallels Kant's *synthesis*—the activity of the understanding that combines the manifold of intuition into unified experience. However, the author's usage is broader and more dynamic: construction includes not just cognitive synthesis but practical, linguistic, and cultural construction. The author's \"construction\" (构造) in category theory refers to the *塔式构造* (tower construction) by which higher-order structures emerge from lower-order ones. This formalizes what Kant described discursively: how concepts of increasing generality/abstraction arise from more concrete contents. The key difference: the author treats construction as ongoing, revisable, and multiple (different constructions possible), whereas Kant's synthesis via the categories is fixed and universal.\n   103→\n   104→---\n   105→\n   106→## 综合 (zōnghé)\n   107→- **Main translation**: Synthesis / synthetic\n   108→- **Alternatives**:\n   109→  - \"Combination\" in non-technical contexts\n   110→  - \"Synthetic judgment\" when discussing knowledge claims\n   111→- **Note**: Kant's *Synthesis*—the act of combining different representations and grasping their manifoldness in one cognition. In Kant, synthesis is the fundamental operation of understanding; all knowledge involves synthesis of intuitions under concepts. The author uses this term in parallel sense: the subjective synthesis of phenomena to produce meaning. In the appendix essay, the author writes: \"一件事物的意义是什么这一问题的回答可能是一种知识（即可能是一种先天综合判断）...通过对现象的主观综合而来\" (The answer to \"what does X mean\" may be a kind of knowledge—synthetic a priori judgment—arising through subjective synthesis of phenomena). This extends Kant's synthetic a priori from mathematics/natural science to the domain of meaning. The framework: meaning has the same epistemic structure as scientific knowledge—it emerges from structural conditions (S_E) through which experience is constituted, not from bare experience or pure concepts alone.\n   112→\n   113→---\n   114→\n   115→## 分析 (fēnxī)\n   116→- **Main translation**: Analysis / analytic\n   117→- **Alternatives**:\n   118→  - \"Analytical judgment\" in epistemological contexts\n   119→  - \"Decomposition\" when emphasizing the breaking-down aspect\n   120→- **Note**: Kant's *Analytik* and *analytische Urteile* (analytic judgments)—judgments in which the predicate is contained in the concept of the subject (e.g., \"All bachelors are unmarried\"). Contrasts with synthetic judgments, which add new information. Kant's critical question: \"How are synthetic a priori judgments possible?\" The author adopts this distinction in discussing knowledge but focuses primarily on the synthetic—how new understanding arises. The author's main concern is with construction (synthesis), not decomposition (analysis), though both are operative in the formation and clarification of concepts.\n   121→\n   122→---\n   123→\n   124→## 境 (jìng)\n   125→- **Main translation**: Jing (keep untranslated with gloss) / experiential realm\n   126→- **Alternatives**:\n   127→  - \"Experiential realm\" as translation\n   128→  - \"Field of experience\" in some contexts\n   129→  - \"Lifeworld\" if invoking Husserl\n   130→  - \"境-structure\" when emphasizing the formal structure\n   131→- **Note**: The central concept. E (境) = Enclosed + Emotion + Experience. The structured totality of experience at a moment—现象 with structure imposed on it. In category theory: 境 is a category whose objects are selected from phenomena (感受) and whose morphisms are associations (联想, also 感受). Critically, morphisms are also objects (making E a tower structure / arrows-only metacategory). No direct Kantian equivalent, but resonates with several concepts: Husserl's \"field of consciousness,\" Heidegger's \"world\" (*Welt*), Kant's \"unity of apperception\" as the unified field of experience. The Buddhist/Chinese aesthetic term 境界 (realm, state of mind) underlies this usage. The author's innovation: formalizing this with category theory to describe both the structure and its evolution (via functor T). In Kantian terms, 境 is experience *as structured by the subject*, but the author does not presume Kant's specific forms (space/time) or categories. Instead, the structure is to be discovered empirically. Recommended: Keep \"Jing\" untranslated in the main translation with explanatory notes, using \"experiential realm\" or \"境-structure\" where clarification is needed.\n   132→\n   133→---\n   134→\n   135→## 恒常 (héngcháng)\n   136→- **Main translation**: Constancy\n   137→- **Alternatives**:\n   138→  - \"Permanence\" when invoking Kant's First Analogy explicitly\n   139→  - \"Invariance\" in mathematical/formal contexts\n   140→  - \"Stability\" when discussing stable structures\n   141→- **Note**: The core of all 形而上—the pursuit of invariant structure amid phenomenal change. The author writes: \"形而上的核心是恒常\" (The core of the metaphysical is constancy). This is what we seek when we form concepts, make predictions, abstract generalizations—a \"guarantee\" (保证) that the same structures will recur. In Kantian terms, this resonates with the First Analogy of Experience—the principle of the permanence of substance (CPR A182/B224). For Kant, permanence is a transcendental condition: without something permanent in intuition, no time-determination is possible, hence no experience. The author's 恒常 is both the *object* of metaphysical pursuit and the *structural feature* preserved by evolution functor T in stable structure S_E. This is the non-rational drive (非理性) underlying all cognition: the need for \"handles\" (抓手) on phenomena to make meaningful action possible. Translation: \"constancy\" avoids the excessive Kantian specificity of \"permanence\" while preserving the sense of temporal/structural invariance.\n   142→\n   143→---\n   144→\n   145→## 感受 (gǎnshòu)\n   146→- **Main translation**: Feeling / sensation (context-dependent)\n   147→- **Alternatives**:\n   148→  - \"Sensory experience\" when emphasizing empirical input\n   149→  - \"Affective experience\" when emphasizing emotion\n   150→  - \"Experiential content\" in formal contexts\n   151→- **Note**: The fundamental unit of P (现象). The author writes: \"即便对于客观世界模型来说，任何对于我们有影响的事物都必须通过'感受'或者'体验'以'进入'我们的'视野'以成为'现象'\" (Even for the objective world model, anything that affects us must enter our view through \"feeling\" or \"experience\" to become \"phenomenon\"). This is phenomenologically immediate—the raw \"what it is like\" of experience. Closer to the sensory \"matter\" of appearance in Kant's terminology, or to *Empfindung* (sensation), but without Kant's sharp form/matter distinction. The author treats 感受 as both objects and morphisms in E—both the contents of experience and the associative links between them. This anticipates the tower structure of 境. Translation: \"feeling\" for affective/phenomenological contexts; \"sensation\" when emphasizing sensory input; clarify with context.\n   152→\n   153→---\n   154→\n   155→## 经验 (jīngyàn)\n   156→- **Main translation**: Experience\n   157→- **Alternatives**:\n   158→  - \"Empirical experience\" when contrasting with a priori\n   159→  - \"Experiential\" (adjective)\n   160→- **Note**: Kant's *Erfahrung*—structured, unified cognition of phenomena. For Kant, experience is always already synthesized by the understanding via the categories; it is not mere perception but cognition of objects in accordance with rules. The author uses 经验 similarly—experience as structured by 境, not raw phenomena. However, the author's framework allows for more radical variability in experiential structure across individuals and developmental stages (via different S_E), whereas Kant insists on universal forms. The author's post-metaphysical stance: experience is the starting point (第一实在) and the site of all construction, but its structure is not deduced a priori (as in Kant) but investigated empirically through \"philosophical experiments.\"\n   161→\n   162→---\n   163→\n   164→## 体验 (tǐyàn)\n   165→- **Main translation**: Lived experience / concrete experience\n   166→- **Alternatives**:\n   167→  - \"Experiential episode\" for individual instances\n   168→  - \"Experiencing\" (gerund) to emphasize process\n   169→- **Note**: Often synonymous with 感受 in the author's usage but with a more holistic connotation—the *living through* of experience, not just isolated sensations. Closer to Husserl's *Erlebnis* (lived experience) or Dilthey's *Erleben*. The author uses 体验 and 感受 somewhat interchangeably to denote the contents of 现象/P. In contexts where distinction matters, 体验 suggests richer, more integrated experiential episodes (e.g., aesthetic experience, emotional states), while 感受 can refer to more elementary sensory/affective units. Translation flexibility: use \"lived experience\" for phenomenological emphasis, \"experience\" in general usage.\n   170→\n   171→---\n   172→\n   173→## 非理性 (fēi lǐxìng)\n   174→- **Main translation**: The non-rational\n   175→- **Alternatives**:\n   176→  - \"Non-rational drive\" when referring to the underlying impulse\n   177→  - \"Arational\" to emphasize not anti-rational but outside reason's scope\n   178→- **Note**: NOT \"irrational\" (which implies opposition to reason or irrationality as defect). \"Non-rational\" indicates something outside reason's domain but not thereby condemned. The author's critical claim: \"理性的目的必然要在理性之外...理性仅仅作为一种工具而存在\" (Reason's purpose must lie outside reason...reason exists only as a tool). Therefore: \"对终极实在的追求本身就是非理性的（形而上学本身就是非理性的）\" (The pursuit of ultimate reality is itself non-rational; metaphysics itself is non-rational). The drive for 恒常 (constancy), for \"handles\" on phenomena, for self-realization through practice—all are 非理性. This must be *acknowledged* (承认), not overcome. This marks a departure from Kant: for Kant, reason's demand for the unconditioned (the Ideas of Reason) is *rational*, even if it cannot be satisfied theoretically. The author's genealogy is closer to Nietzsche (the will to power underlying reason) or Schopenhauer (the Will underlying representation). However, the author does not valorize the non-rational over the rational; instead, post-metaphysics *acknowledges* both and works with them in 实践.\n   179→\n   180→---\n   181→\n   182→## 理性 (lǐxìng)\n   183→- **Main translation**: Reason / rationality\n   184→- **Alternatives**:\n   185→  - \"Rational faculty\" when referring to Kant's *Vernunft*\n   186→  - \"The rational\" as substantive\n   187→- **Note**: Kant's *Vernunft* (Reason) vs. *Verstand* (Understanding). In Kant's architecture, Understanding applies categories to intuitions to produce experience; Reason seeks systematic unity and generates the Ideas (God, freedom, immortality). The author uses 理性 more generally for the capacity for conceptual thought, inference, justification—the \"rational\" dimension of cognition. The key post-metaphysical move: reason is a *tool* (工具), and its purposes are non-rational (非理性). This deflates reason from its Kantian status as the source of necessary structures (categories) and regulative ideals (Ideas) to a means in service of non-rational ends. However, the author does not abandon rational inquiry; rather, post-metaphysics acknowledges that reason operates within bounds set by non-rational drives (for constancy, self-realization) and returns to phenomena through practice.\n   188→\n   189→---\n   190→\n   191→## 超越 (chāoyuè)\n   192→- **Main translation**: Transcendence / to transcend\n   193→- **Alternatives**:\n   194→  - \"Surpassing\" when emphasizing the movement beyond\n   195→  - \"Going beyond\" in simpler contexts\n   196→- **Note**: Going beyond current limits—of experience, of the self, of a given 境. The author distinguishes: (1) 超越 of the 境界 (boundary) of thought—moving from one cognitive/experiential structure to another (e.g., via evolution functor T); (2) The unattainable 超越 toward 第〇实在, which is non-rational and always transforms into 第二实在 when articulated. In Kantian terms, *transzendental* (transcendental) refers to conditions of possibility of experience; *transzendent* (transcendent) refers to what lies beyond possible experience. The author's usage is closer to the latter—transcendence as the movement beyond a given boundary. However, post-metaphysics recognizes that we cannot transcend phenomena themselves (第一实在), only move from one structured configuration (境) to another. The author's notion of 超越 is more akin to Heidegger's *Überstieg* or existentialist notions of self-overcoming than to Kant's transcendental method.\n   197→\n   198→---\n   199→\n   200→## 超越性 (chāoyuè xìng)\n   201→- **Main translation**: Transcendence (substantive) / transcendent quality\n   202→- **Alternatives**:\n   203→  - \"Transcendent dimension\" when referring to what lies beyond\n   204→  - \"The transcendent\" as philosophical term\n   205→- **Note**: The quality or dimension of what lies beyond (a 境, a framework, the self). The author writes: \"超越之所在是（可以）存在的\" (Transcendence can exist), but it is not directly accessible—we encounter only its \"results\" (the phenomena that are \"放入篮子,\" placed in the basket). In Kantian terms, this is the transcendent realm (God, noumena, things-in-themselves)—posited but unknowable. The author's twist: we study the *manifestation* of transcendence (how phenomena change, how 境 evolves), not transcendence itself. This is the research program of K1 strategy: to study the evolution of 境 (via functor T) to understand how \"what enters the basket\" (what becomes phenomenon) structures experience. The author's 超越性 is not a separate ontological realm but the *dynamic* dimension of experience—the fact that 境 evolves, that new structures emerge, that we are not trapped in a static framework.\n   206→\n   207→---\n   208→\n   209→## 自然变换 (zìrán biànhuàn)\n   210→- **Main translation**: Natural transformation\n   211→- **Alternatives**: None (this is a technical term from category theory)\n   212→- **Note**: A concept from mathematical category theory: a natural transformation η between two functors F and G (both from category C to D) assigns to each object X in C a morphism η_X: F(X) → G(X) in D, such that for every morphism f: X → Y in C, the naturality condition holds: G(f) ∘ η_X = η_Y ∘ F(f). The author's philosophical application: a natural transformation between the evolution of formal structures (language, mathematics) and the evolution of experience (境) is the condition of *understanding*. When we \"understand\" a sentence, a formula, or a phenomenon, we establish a natural transformation linking the structural unfolding of that object with our experiential/cognitive process. The η morphisms represent the \"feeling of alignment\" (一致性感受) or \"confirmation\" (确认). When η is the identity morphism, we have *mastery* (掌握)—direct, immediate understanding without mediation. This is a profound formalization of what it means to \"get it\": the isomorphism (or at least systematic correspondence) between external structure and internal process. In Kantian terms, this formalizes the schematism—the mediating process between pure concepts and sensible intuitions—and extends it to meaning, aesthetics, and all understanding.\n   213→\n   214→---\n   215→\n   216→## 函子 (hánzǐ)\n   217→- **Main translation**: Functor\n   218→- **Alternatives**: None (technical term from category theory)\n   219→- **Note**: A structure-preserving map between categories. A functor F: C → D maps objects of C to objects of D and morphisms of C to morphisms of D, preserving composition and identities. The author's key application: the evolution functor T: E_t → E_{t+1} describes how 境 changes over \"time\" (t need not be physical time—any label for developmental/processual stages). Various \"转换函子\" (transformation functors) map between subcategories: F_{E,L} embeds language-境 into total 境; F_{L→K} maps language to knowledge; etc. Functors formalize processes: learning, understanding, conceptual development, structural change. This is the author's major methodological innovation beyond Kant: Kant's framework is static (the categories do not evolve); the author introduces dynamics via functors. This allows for developmental psychology, historical/cultural variation in cognitive structures, and individual differences—all within a transcendental-style framework.\n   220→\n   221→---\n   222→\n   223→## 稳定结构 (wěndìng jiégòu)\n   224→- **Main translation**: Stable structure\n   225→- **Alternatives**:\n   226→  - \"Invariant structure\" when emphasizing what is preserved\n   227→  - \"Structural invariant\" in mathematical contexts\n   228→- **Note**: The structure S_E preserved under the evolution functor T—what remains constant as 境 evolves. This is the formal counterpart to 恒常 (constancy). The author's conjecture: there exists a stable structure S_E such that T(S_E) ≅ S_E (T preserves S_E, up to isomorphism). If S_E can be identified at the earliest stage E_{t_c}, it becomes a candidate for \"a priori cognitive structure\" (先天认知结构)—though the author is careful to note this is descriptive, not prescriptive, and requires empirical investigation via \"philosophical experiments.\" In Kantian terms, S_E corresponds to the forms of intuition (space/time) and categories of understanding—the necessary structures without which no experience could be constituted. The key differences from Kant: (1) S_E is not deduced from the table of judgments but conjectured and investigated; (2) S_E may vary across individuals/populations/developmental stages; (3) S_E is discovered by examining what structure remains invariant under T, not by transcendental deduction. This is the empirical-transcendental synthesis the author proposes: transcendental in form (conditions of possible experience), empirical in method (discovered through investigation of experiential evolution).\n   229→\n   230→---\n   231→\n   232→## 认知结构 (rènzhī jiégòu)\n   233→- **Main translation**: Cognitive structure\n   234→- **Alternatives**:\n   235→  - \"Epistemic structure\" when emphasizing knowledge\n   236→  - \"Conceptual framework\" in less technical contexts\n   237→- **Note**: The structural features of 境 that enable cognition. The author writes: \"如果你认为E表示了某种认知，那么假如能够证明这一稳定结构当中的一部分一旦缺失，则无法从P_t中构建任何E_t，则可以将这部分稳定结构称之为'认知结构'\" (If E represents cognition, and if it can be shown that without part of the stable structure, no E_t can be constructed from P_t, then this part may be called \"cognitive structure\"). This is a transcendental argument: X is a cognitive structure if X is a necessary condition for constructing 境 from phenomena. Parallel to Kant's categories as conditions of the possibility of experience. The author's framework allows for empirical investigation of what these structures are (via philosophical experiments across populations), whereas Kant deduces them a priori. In contemporary terms, this bridges transcendental philosophy and cognitive science—an empirical search for innate or developmentally necessary cognitive structures, but framed within a transcendental architecture (conditions of possibility).\n   238→\n   239→---\n   240→\n   241→## Additional Terms\n   242→\n   243→### 泛性质 (fàn xìngzhì)\n   244→- **Main translation**: Universal property\n   245→- **Note**: Technical term from category theory. An object X in category C has a universal property if every other object in C (or in a relevant subcategory) maps to/from X in a unique way. The author's definition of 形而上: \"一个形而上m是E中的联想，且m在E的某个子范畴中是范性质\" (A metaphysical construct m is a morphism in E, and m is a universal property in some subcategory of E). Example: the concept \"笔\" (pen) is a universal property in the subcategory of E containing 铅笔, 钢笔, 粉笔, etc. The \"feeling\" we get when seeing any pen is the universal property—the limit/terminal object toward which all specific pen-experiences map. This formalizes what Kant called the \"schema\" of a concept and what traditional metaphysics called the \"essence\" or \"universal.\"\n   246→\n   247→### 塔式结构 (tǎ shì jiégòu)\n   248→- **Main translation**: Tower structure\n   249→- **Note**: A category where morphisms are also objects, constructed iteratively: T_0 (base category) → T_1 (objects are morphisms of T_0) → T_2 (objects are objects and morphisms of T_1) → ... → T_∞. The author's 境 (E) is a tower structure because morphisms (associations, 联想) are also experiential contents (感受), hence also objects. This structure allows for meta-levels: thinking about thinking, concepts of concepts, associations between associations. This formalizes the reflexivity of consciousness and the hierarchical structure of abstraction. No direct Kantian parallel, but related to Fichte's reflexive self-positing of the I.\n   250→\n   251→### 实践 (shíjiàn)\n   252→- **Main translation**: Practice / praxis\n   253→- **Note**: The core methodological principle of post-metaphysics: \"理想和现象之重叠\" (the overlap of ideal and phenomenon). Through practice, we construct 境, test them against phenomena, and iterate. This is not Kant's \"practical reason\" (moral/volitional) but closer to pragmatist or Marxist praxis—the active, iterative engagement with the world that constitutes both self and world. Practice is how post-metaphysics avoids dogmatism: we acknowledge that all constructs are 第二实在 (Second Reality), and we test them through practice, revising as needed. This is the post-metaphysical answer to nihilism: not \"nothing matters\" but \"we construct what matters, and practice tests and refines our constructions.\"\n   254→\n   255→### 诗意 (shīyì)\n   256→- **Main translation**: The poetic / poetic engagement\n   257→- **Note**: The author's term for the proper stance after post-metaphysical recognition. \"清醒的梦境\" (lucid dreaming)—we construct and inhabit meaningful structures while knowing they are constructions. Not Kant's \"discipline of pure reason\" but closer to Nietzsche's \"gay science,\" Heidegger's \"poetic dwelling,\" or Daoist \"play\" (游). The poetic is the *freedom* to construct境, to engage with experience creatively, aesthetically, meaningfully, without metaphysical illusion but also without nihilistic despair. This is the post-metaphysical resolution: neither dogmatic belief in 第〇实在 nor nihilistic rejection of all 形而上, but deliberate, acknowledged, joyful construction.\n   258→\n   259→---\n   260→\n   261→## Conclusion\n   262→\n   263→This dictionary provides translation recommendations grounded in the Kantian/transcendental philosophical tradition while acknowledging the author's innovations and divergences. The author's framework is recognizably transcendental in structure (phenomena → conditions of possibility → structured experience) but post-Kantian in method (empirical investigation, dynamic evolution, explicit acknowledgment of non-rationality).

In Buddhist tradition, 境 translates Sanskrit *visaya* (sense-object domain) or *gocara* (field of activity). In Yogacara philosophy, it refers to the object-realm arising in relation to consciousness. In Daoist usage, it appears in compounds like 仙境 (immortal realm) and 意境 (artistic conception). The author's usage is FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT: 境 is formally defined as **a category-theoretic structure on phenomena (P)**—specifically, a category E where selected experiences become objects and associations (联想) between them become morphisms. This has three defining features: (1) built on 现象/感受 (phenomena/felt experience), (2) possesses formal structure (a category with tower structure), (3) evolves dynamically (via functors T_t). The author explicitly considers alternative names: \"游戏、书、冒险、小世界、小自在\" (game, book, adventure, small world, small freedom). DANGER: Do not collapse this back into traditional Buddhist 境界 (spiritual attainment level) or aesthetic 意境. This is a technical term for the organized totality of how experiences relate to one another. The closest traditional resonance is 境界 in its most general sense (\"the world as experienced from a particular standpoint\"), but the author has mathematically formalized it. Translation strategy: Use \"Jing\" consistently with extensive initial apparatus explaining the term, or use \"Experiential Realm\" throughout with reminder that this is a structured, evolving, constructed domain.\n    16→\n    17→---\n    18→\n    19→## 境界 (jìngjiè)\n    20→\n    21→- **Main translation**: **\"Realm\"** or **\"Experiential realm\"**\n    22→- **Alternatives**: \"Domain,\" \"Sphere,\" \"Level of attainment\" (Buddhist contexts)\n    23→- **Note**: Traditional compound meaning \"domain/sphere/realm\" or \"level of spiritual attainment\" (Buddhist). In Chinese aesthetics and philosophy, 境界 often refers to the sphere of understanding or attainment one has reached. The author uses this more loosely than 境 proper. When the author writes \"思想的境界\" (the realm of thought), this refers to the boundaries/limits/scope of thought, not the technical category-theoretic structure.

In Daoist tradition (Laozi, Zhuangzi), 道 is the ultimate source, the ineffable cosmic principle from which all things flow. \"道可道,非常道\" (The Way that can be spoken is not the eternal Way). In Confucian contexts, 道 is the moral Way, the path of virtue. The author's RADICAL REINTERPRETATION: 道 is **the ultimate abstraction constructed LAST through progressive generalization from phenomena**, not the primordial source given first. In the reversal argument (后形而上学), the author shows: 礼→义→仁→德→道 is the actual construction order, even though the conceptual presentation reverses it as 道→德→仁→义→礼. This is genuinely original—no classical Chinese philosopher has argued that 道 itself is a cognitive construction built from phenomenal observation upward. The translator MUST signal this inversion. In the category theory formalization, 道 appears in two different meta-order tuples: Top-down {(道,0)...} where 道 is initial object, vs. Bottom-up {(道,5)...} where 道 is terminal object produced last. Use \"the Way\" for resonance, but add translator's notes making clear that for this author, the Way is PRODUCED through abstraction, not ontologically prior.\n    32→\n    33→---\n    34→\n    35→## 德 (dé)\n    36→\n    37→- **Main translation**: **\"De\"** (romanized) or **\"inherent character\"**\n    38→- **Alternatives**: \"Virtue\" (Confucian contexts only), \"Power/potency\" (Daoist contexts), \"Nature\"\n    39→- **Note**: Extraordinarily rich semantic field. (1) Confucian 德: moral virtue, character (为政以德, govern through virtue). (2) Daoist 德: the inherent power/potency a thing receives from 道; individual manifestation of cosmic principle. (3) Zhuangzi: inner power, authenticity. (4) Neo-Confucian: closely tied to 性 (nature). (5) Etymology: related to 得 (to obtain)—德 originally meant \"what is obtained.\" The author's CONSTRUCTIVIST REINTERPRETATION: 德 = \"what makes a thing what it is\" (使得人而成为人的东西). More precisely: the collection of properties we *inductively generalize* from observations and then *normatively impose* as definitional. The key move: from 属性 (property—\"people CAN have 仁\") to 定义 (definition—\"people SHOULD have 仁\" or \"有仁的才是人\"). 德 is what we *decide* defines a thing, not what a thing inherently possesses ontologically. This resonates with Aristotelian essence but is framed as cognitive construction. DANGER: \"Virtue\" imports moral connotations the author strips away (德 applies to all things, not just moral agents). \"Essence\" imports Western metaphysical baggage. Best practice: use \"De\" romanized in philosophical passages, \"inherent character\" when English gloss needed, with translator's note on constructivist dimension.\n    40→\n    41→---\n    42→\n    43→## 仁 (rén)\n    44→\n    45→- **Main translation**: **\"Humaneness\"** (preferred) or **\"Fellow-feeling\"**\n    46→- **Alternatives**: \"Benevolence,\" \"Human-heartedness,\" \"Goodness,\" \"Ren\"\n    47→- **Note**: Core Confucian virtue. Traditionally: the fundamental disposition of care/concern for others, the basis of moral cultivation. Mencius: 仁者爱人 (The humane person loves others). The author distinguishes **现象仁** (phenomenal 仁) from the theoretical concept. 现象仁 = the inner feeling (发乎于心的对他人的感受) I experience when I care for others—a felt sentiment observable in myself. The author then describes projection: I see others performing 现象礼 and *assume* they have 现象仁 even though I cannot directly access their inner states. From \"people CAN have 仁\" (observed property), we leap to \"people SHOULD have 仁\" (definitional requirement). The author's usage emphasizes 仁 as *inner feeling first*, behavioral expression second. DANGER: \"Benevolence\" is too external/active. \"Compassion\" imports Buddhist overtones. \"Love\" is too broad. \"Humaneness\" or \"fellow-feeling\" best captures the experiential, empathetic dimension the author emphasizes. In passages about 现象仁, consider \"the felt sentiment of care\" or \"the inner sense of fellow-feeling.\"\n    48→\n    49→---\n    50→\n    51→## 义 (yì)\n    52→\n    53→- **Main translation**: **\"Rightness\"** (general); **\"Moral impetus\"** or **\"Sense of obligation\"** (author's specific usage)\n    54→- **Alternatives**: \"Righteousness,\" \"Duty,\" \"Appropriateness,\" \"Yi\"\n    55→- **Note**: Traditional meanings: (1) Confucian: righteousness, moral appropriateness, what is fitting. (2) Mencius: 义者宜也 (Yi is what is appropriate). Often paired with 仁 as the two cardinal virtues. The author's SPECIFIC USAGE: 义 is the *motivational bridge* between inner feeling (仁) and outward action (礼). Described as \"推动力\" (motivation/driving force) and \"motivation.\" In the phenomenology: 现象义 = the felt impulse/obligation I experience that moves me from feeling care (现象仁) to performing appropriate behavior (现象礼). This is more dynamic/kinetic than traditional readings. DANGER: \"Righteousness\" has become overly moralistic in English and suggests achieved virtue rather than motivational force. \"Duty\" is too Kantian. Best practice: \"rightness\" in traditional contexts, \"moral impetus\" or \"sense of obligation\" when author is describing the phenomenological movement from 仁 to 礼.

Confucius: 克己复礼为仁 (To master oneself and return to ritual is humaneness). In Xunzi, 礼 is human-created social form (人为). The author distinguishes **现象礼** (phenomenal 礼) = observable behavioral patterns in social interaction—concrete, visible conduct. This is the most empirical, phenomenal level of the 道德仁义礼 hierarchy. The author argues we start from observing 现象礼 (how people actually treat each other) and work upward, even though the conceptual presentation reverses this. DANGER: \"Ritual\" in English suggests religiosity or empty ceremony. The author's 现象礼 is simply observable social behavior patterns. Consider \"ritual conduct\" to emphasize the behavioral dimension, or \"patterned behavior\" when phenomenal immediacy is stressed. In traditional contexts, \"ritual\" or \"propriety\" work fine. The key distinction: 现象礼 (what we observe) vs. theoretical/normative 礼 (what the metaphysical system prescribes).\n    64→\n    65→---\n    66→\n    67→## 形而上 (xíng ér shàng)\n    68→\n    69→- **Main translation**: **\"The metaphysical\"** (as adjective/substantive)\n    70→- **Alternatives**: \"What is above form,\" \"The supra-phenomenal\"\n    71→- **Note**: Origin: 易经系辞传 (Xici zhuan), Ch. 8.5: \"形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器\" (What is above form is called the Way; what is within form is called implements). In classical usage, 形 = visible/manifest form; 形而上 = what transcends physical form (the Way); 形而下 = concrete implements. The author REINTERPRETS 形 as 现象 (phenomena) and distinguishes 形而上 (a framework of understanding above phenomena, a conceptual superstructure) from 形而上学 (the systematic study of metaphysics as discipline). The author's claim: \"中国哲学大多是有形而上而无形而上学的\"—Chinese philosophy predominantly operates within a given metaphysical framework (天道, 仁义) to achieve moral perfection, but does not typically *investigate the foundations* of that framework the way Western metaphysics does. DANGER: Collapsing 形而上 and 形而上学 into single \"metaphysics.\" English \"metaphysical\" (adjective) vs. \"metaphysics\" (discipline) partially captures this. Translator must preserve the distinction consistently. Consider: \"the metaphysical\" vs. \"metaphysics-as-discipline\" or \"metaphysical framework\" vs. \"metaphysical inquiry.\"\n    72→\n    73→---\n    74→\n    75→## 形而上学 (xíng ér shàng xué)\n    76→\n    77→- **Main translation**: **\"Metaphysics\"** (as discipline) or **\"Metaphysical inquiry\"**\n    78→- **Alternatives**: \"The study of the metaphysical,\" \"Metaphysics-as-discipline\"\n    79→- **Note**: The term 形而上学 was coined by Japanese scholar Inoue Tetsujiro (井上哲次郎) in the Meiji period to translate \"metaphysics,\" combining 形而上 with 学 (study/discipline). The author insists: 形而上学 = the *systematic investigation* of metaphysics, the study of ultimate reality, distinct from 形而上 (a framework one inhabits). The author claims Chinese philosophy is mostly 有形而上而无形而上学—has metaphysical frameworks but lacks systematic metaphysical inquiry as a discipline (一是皆以修身为本, all start from self-cultivation). This is broadly accurate: Confucianism takes 天 and 仁 as given; Daoism takes 道 as given; even Neo-Confucian 理学 focuses on cultivation over pure inquiry. TRANSLATION: Use \"metaphysics\" where English demands a noun, but add clarifying phrases like \"metaphysics as systematic inquiry\" or \"metaphysical investigation\" to distinguish from 形而上. The distinction must be maintained throughout.\n    80→\n    81→---\n    82→\n    83→## 诗意 (shī yì)\n    84→\n    85→- **Main translation**: **\"The Poetic\"** (capitalized as philosophical stance)\n    86→- **Alternatives**: \"Poetic awareness,\" \"Poetic engagement,\" \"Poeticness,\" \"Poetic sensibility\"\n    87→- **Note**: Literally \"poetic meaning/intention.\" In Chinese aesthetics, 诗意 refers to poetic sensibility, the evocative quality of poetry. Related to 意境 (artistic conception—synthesis of subjective intention 意 and objective scene 境). The author's RADICAL REFRAMING: 诗意 is NOT merely aesthetic but an *epistemic and existential stance*—the post-metaphysical position. Defined as **\"清醒的梦境\"** (lucid dream): knowing you are within a constructed experiential environment (境/梦境) while still fully committing to it. Binary opposition: **沉醉的梦境** = belief/faith (not realizing you're in a constructed framework) → 信念/信仰; **清醒的梦境** = 诗意 (knowing the framework is constructed but committing fully) → post-metaphysical stance. This is the answer to nihilism (虚无主义之后): since there is no 终极实在 and we cannot deny our feelings, the only path is to treat feelings poetically—lucidly, with full engagement despite/because of awareness of construction. Resonances: (1) Zhuangzi's 庄周梦蝶 but without skeptical uncertainty—affirms engagement; (2) Chan/Zen \"returning to marketplace\" after enlightenment but without Buddhist soteriology; (3) 意境 tradition's awareness that greatest art knows its artifice yet transcends it. DANGER: \"Poetic\" in English trivializes the existential weight. The translator must establish early that 诗意 is an *existential category*, not literary appreciation. Use \"the Poetic\" (capitalized) to signal philosophical weight, comparable to \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime.\" In context: \"poetic awareness,\" \"poetic stance,\" \"poetic engagement.\"\n    88→\n    89→---\n    90→\n    91→## 意境 (yì jìng)\n    92→\n    93→- **Main translation**: **\"Artistic conception\"** or **\"Realm of meaning\"**\n    94→- **Alternatives**: \"Mood and atmosphere,\" \"Poetic realm,\" \"Aesthetic realm\"\n    95→- **Note**: Classical Chinese aesthetic term. 意 = subjective intention/meaning of artist; 境 = objective scene/realm depicted; 意境 = their synthesis, the fusion of subjective feeling and objective scene. The tradition stretches from Wang Changling 王昌龄 (Tang: 物境/情境/意境—realm of things/feelings/ideas) through Wang Guowei 王国维 (人间词话). The author uses 意境 in its traditional aesthetic sense, distinct from the technical term 境. When discussing 诗意, the author is building on but going beyond 意境 theory—moving from aesthetics to existential stance. Translation: Use \"artistic conception\" for traditional aesthetic usage.

In Daoist tradition, 常 = unchanging pattern beneath change, eternal principle. Buddhism counters with 无常 (impermanence, anicca). The author's DISTINCT USAGE: 恒常 is **epistemological and pragmatic**, not ontological. Definition: \"形而上的核心是恒常\"—the core of metaphysical thinking is constancy. It is a \"保证\" (guarantee): \"同样的现象（实在）将会重复的出现\"—the same phenomena will recur. This is NOT saying things really ARE permanent (Daoist 常) or really are impermanent (Buddhist 无常)—it is saying we *seek* invariant patterns in phenomena in order to act meaningfully. Without constancy, we have no \"抓手\" (handle/grip) on phenomena—we cannot act with purpose (就像拿手指在波涛汹涌的海洋中随手搅拌一样, like stirring the turbulent ocean with a finger). The pursuit of 恒常 is explicitly identified as *non-rational* (非理性)—we pursue it not because reason demands it but because without it action is impossible. Tied to 同一 (identity) and 因果 (causality), which the author claims are temporal 同一. In K1 strategy, formalized as \"stable structure\" (稳定结构, S_E). DANGER: \"Permanence\" implies ontological fixity the author denies. \"Eternity\" is too theological. \"Invariance\" is too technical. \"Constancy\" appropriately straddles epistemological necessity and phenomenological seeking. Use \"constancy\" with footnote explaining the epistemological/pragmatic (not ontological) character.\n   104→\n   105→---\n   106→\n   107→## 常 (cháng)\n   108→\n   109→- **Main translation**: **\"The constant\"** or **\"Constancy\"**\n   110→- **Alternatives**: \"The eternal,\" \"Permanence\" (Daoist contexts)\n   111→- **Note**: See 恒常 above. 常 alone has same Daoist pedigree. When the author uses 常 without 恒, context determines if traditional Daoist sense or the author's epistemological sense. Typically the author uses 恒常 for the technical concept.\n   112→\n   113→---\n   114→\n   115→## 虚无 (xū wú)\n   116→\n   117→- **Main translation**: **\"The void\"** or **\"Nothingness\"**\n   118→- **Alternatives**: \"Emptiness\" (avoid—too Buddhist)\n   119→- **Note**: In the author's usage, 虚无 refers to nihilism's void—the absence left when the highest value (终极实在, ultimate reality) collapses. Explicitly NOT a positive entity: \"虚无主义不是一种有、一种主义，而是一种无\" (Nihilism is not a something, a doctrine, but a nothing, a lack). The author gives personal etymology (footnote in 诗意 essay): 虚 = \"without real significance,\" 妄 = \"arrogant, self-deceptive.\" CRITICAL DISTINCTION from Buddhist 空 (śūnyatā, emptiness)—these are completely different. The author's 虚无 is the *absence of transcendent ground* after metaphysics collapses, not the Buddhist insight into dependent origination and emptiness of inherent existence. Buddhist 空 is a *positive* philosophical realization; nihilistic 虚无 is a *negative* collapse. The translator must never conflate these. Use \"the void\" or \"nothingness\" for 虚无; reserve \"emptiness\" for Buddhist 空.\n   120→\n   121→---\n   122→\n   123→## 空 (kōng)\n   124→\n   125→- **Main translation**: **\"Emptiness\"** (Buddhist); **\"Empty\"** (adjectival)\n   126→- **Alternatives**: \"Void,\" \"Vacuity,\" \"Śūnyatā\" (transliterated Sanskrit)\n   127→- **Note**: In Buddhist contexts, 空 translates Sanskrit *śūnyatā* (emptiness)—the Madhyamaka teaching that all phenomena lack inherent existence, arise through dependent origination. A central Mahayana concept. In Chinese aesthetics (Chan/Zen), 空灵 (ethereal emptiness) is an aesthetic quality. When author uses 空, determine from context whether Buddhist philosophical sense or general sense of \"empty/vacant.\" Do NOT confuse with nihilistic 虚无. The author rarely uses 空 in technical Buddhist sense—mostly uses it in examples (like \"空\" as terminal object in 忒修斯之船 thought experiment). Translation: \"Emptiness\" for Buddhist contexts, \"empty\" or \"void\" otherwise, with care not to conflate with 虚无.\n   128→\n   129→---\n   130→\n   131→## 现象 (xiàn xiàng)\n   132→\n   133→- **Main translation**: **\"Phenomena\"**\n   134→- **Alternatives**: \"Phenomenon\" (singular), \"Appearances\"\n   135→- **Note**: Standard philosophical translation of phenomena. The author gives it full phenomenological weight: \"what we currently 'have'\"—the totality of what appears to us; called **第一实在** (first reality). Explicitly modeled on phenomenological usage (Kant, Husserl). \"我们任何的对于现象的理解，都基于现象\" (Any understanding of phenomena is based on phenomena). Phenomena are **the foundation** (第一实在), not derivative. The author reinterprets 形 (form) from the Xici zhuan as 现象. DANGER: In everyday Chinese, 现象 just means \"situation\" or \"occurrence.\" The author gives it philosophical weight—what appears to consciousness, the given experiential manifold. The translator must signal this is technical phenomenological usage, not colloquial \"phenomenon.\" Consider initial note: \"Throughout, 'phenomena' (现象) refers not merely to observable events but to the totality of what appears to consciousness—the experiential given, following phenomenological tradition.\"\n   136→\n   137→---\n   138→\n   139→## 感受 (gǎn shòu)\n   140→\n   141→- **Main translation**: **\"Felt experience\"** or **\"Feeling\"**\n   142→- **Alternatives**: \"Sensation,\" \"Felt sense\"\n   143→- **Note**: The author uses 感受 to refer to parts of P (phenomena). Defined as any element of experiential manifold. The author notes (footnote 2 of 诗意 essay) that 感受 has two senses: (1) received stimulus/information (受到之感觉); (2) the crystallized/emergent feeling that results (构成的\"结晶\"、\"涌动\"、\"湍流\"). P is \"全部的感受之总和\" (the totality of felt experience). Also: \"感受和意义即是两面一体\" (feeling and meaning are two sides of one thing). DANGER: English \"feeling\" can trivialize (suggesting emotion only). \"Sensation\" is too narrow (sense-data only). The author means something broader: any element of experiential consciousness. Consider \"felt experience\" to capture experiential breadth, or \"feeling\" with initial note clarifying this includes all experiential content, not just emotions. In technical passages about P, consider \"experiential content\" or \"experiential element.\"\n   144→\n   145→---\n   146→\n   147→## 体验 (tǐ yàn)\n   148→\n   149→- **Main translation**: **\"Lived experience\"** or **\"Experience\"**\n   150→- **Alternatives**: \"Undergone experience\"\n   151→- **Note**: 体验 = lived/undergone experience, emphasizing the experiential process. The author sometimes uses 感受 and 体验 interchangeably, sometimes distinguishes them. Both refer to parts of P. 体验 emphasizes the *living-through* quality. When discussing games, art, life, the author often uses 体验 (游戏体验, 剧情体验, 哲学体验)—the experience obtained. Translation: \"lived experience\" emphasizes phenomenological dimension; \"experience\" works when context is clear. Distinguished from 感受 primarily by emphasis: 体验 = process of experiencing; 感受 = felt content/quality.\n   152→\n   153→---\n   154→\n   155→## 梦境 (mèng jìng)\n   156→\n   157→- **Main translation**: **\"Dream-realm\"**\n   158→- **Alternatives**: \"Dreamscape,\" \"Experiential dream-realm\"\n   159→- **Note**: NOT literal dreaming. The author writes: \"梦境并不仅仅是指的我们在睡觉时脑海中呈现的景象\" (Dream-realm does not merely refer to scenes in our mind when sleeping). Also considers names: \"游戏、书、冒险、小世界、小自在\" (game, book, adventure, small world, small freedom). Definition: **an experiential environment that makes certain meanings possible**; the \"packaging\" of experience; the context in which purpose and meaning arise. Examples: games, novels, rituals, relationships—any structured experiential environment. 梦境 includes both 沉醉的梦境 (immersed dream = belief/faith, unaware of construction) and 清醒的梦境 (lucid dream = 诗意, aware but committed). The term first appears in \"形而上学后的目的:诗意\" then evolves into technical 境. DANGER: English \"dream\" implies unreality, illusion, sleep-state. The author explicitly resists this—梦境 is any meaning-making experiential context, constructed but real in its effects. The poetic resonance of \"dream\" is intentional but must not reduce to \"illusion.\" Use \"dream-realm\" to preserve both 梦 and 境, or expand to \"experiential dream-realm\" when clarification needed.\n   160→\n   161→---\n   162→\n   163→## 清醒 (qīng xǐng)\n   164→\n   165→- **Main translation**: **\"Lucid\"** or **\"Aware\"**\n   166→- **Alternatives**: \"Awake,\" \"Clear-minded,\" \"Conscious\"\n   167→- **Note**: In the binary 沉醉的梦境 vs. 清醒的梦境: 清醒 = aware, knowing you are in a 梦境. Literally \"clear/awake.\" The author: \"所谓清醒，即是说我们知道我们在梦境之中\" (What is called lucidity is knowing we are in a dream-realm). This is NOT detachment or disengagement—清醒 means full awareness of the constructed nature *while maintaining full commitment*. Like lucid dreaming: you know you're dreaming but continue to engage. Translation: \"Lucid\" captures the dream metaphor perfectly (lucid dreaming). \"Aware\" works in contexts where dream metaphor is not active. \"Awake\" risks suggesting you've exited the dream (opposite of intended meaning).\n   168→\n   169→---\n   170→\n   171→## 沉醉 (chén zuì)\n   172→\n   173→- **Main translation**: **\"Immersed\"** or **\"Intoxicated\"**\n   174→- **Alternatives**: \"Absorbed,\" \"Enchanted\"\n   175→- **Note**: In 沉醉的梦境 = belief/faith (信念/信仰). The author: \"所谓沉醉，即是说我们没有意识到我们在梦境中\" (What is called immersion is not being aware we are in a dream-realm). Without awareness of construction, the 梦境 becomes absolute—its purpose becomes \"逻辑上无理由的\" (logically groundless) \"终极之实在\" (ultimate reality). Literally: 沉 = sink, 醉 = intoxicated/drunk. Translation: \"Immersed\" (neutral, captures absorption without negative connotation) or \"intoxicated\" (preserves Chinese metaphor, suggests lack of clear awareness, but risks negative judgment). Consider \"unreflectively immersed\" or \"naively absorbed\" if context demands clarity. The key: 沉醉 lacks the self-awareness that defines 清醒, but is not pejorative—it simply describes pre-philosophical or pre-critical stance.\n   176→\n   177→---\n   178→\n   179→## 实在 (shí zài)\n   180→\n   181→- **Main translation**: **\"Reality\"** (with numerical prefixes preserved)\n   182→- **Alternatives**: \"The real,\" \"Actuality\"\n   183→- **Note**: The author uses numbered realities: **第一实在** (first reality) = phenomena (现象), what appears to consciousness; **第二实在** (second reality) = constructed objects/concepts we build from phenomena (the \"objective world\" in our recognition); **第〇实在** (zeroth reality) = the posited \"true\" objective world prior to observation. The author's critical claim: \"对于我们而言，并不存在第〇实在，而只存在第二实在\" (For us, zeroth reality does not exist, only second reality exists). \"当我们提出第〇实在时，这个我们所提出的东西就是第二实在\" (When we posit zeroth reality, what we posit is actually second reality). This parallels the 道 argument: just as 道 is produced last but presented first, 第〇实在 is posited as prior but is actually a construction. DANGER: The number scheme is the author's invention—must be explained. \"First reality\" does NOT mean \"most real\" in ontological sense (author's footnote 25 warns). The reader must not import Western metaphysical assumptions. Translation: Use \"reality\" with numerical prefixes consistently: \"first reality,\" \"second reality,\" \"zeroth reality.\" Initial translator's note required explaining: (1) numbering is epistemological order of access, not ontological hierarchy; (2) first reality is foundational because it's what we have, not because it's \"most real.\"\n   184→\n   185→---\n   186→\n   187→## 属性 (shǔ xìng)\n   188→\n   189→- **Main translation**: **\"Property\"** or **\"Attribute\"**\n   190→- **Alternatives**: \"Characteristic\" (less precise)\n   191→- **Note**: Used in the crucial move from 属性 to 定义. The author: from \"people CAN have 仁\" (observed property, 属性) to \"people SHOULD have 仁\" (normative definition, 定义)—\"有仁的才是人.\" Properties (属性) are what we observe things having; definitions (定义) are what we decide things must have to count as what they are. This is the mechanism by which 德 (inherent character) is constructed. Standard translation \"property\" works well—captures the philosophical sense of properties things possess contingently.\n   192→\n   193→---\n   194→\n   195→## 定义 (dìng yì)\n   196→\n   197→- **Main translation**: **\"Definition\"**\n   198→- **Alternatives**: \"Defining characteristic\"\n   199→- **Note**: See 属性 above. The move from 属性 (property) to 定义 (definition) is central to the author's constructivist account. An observed 属性 becomes a normative 定义—we go from \"this is something things can have\" to \"this is what makes a thing count as what it is.\" Standard translation \"definition\" is clear and precise.\n   200→\n   201→---\n   202→\n   203→## 天 (tiān)\n   204→\n   205→- **Main translation**: **\"Heaven\"** (traditional cosmological sense) or **\"Nature\"** (in 自然 compounds)\n   206→- **Alternatives**: \"Sky,\" \"Tian\" (romanized)\n   207→- **Note**: Fundamental concept in Chinese cosmology and ethics. In early texts: the cosmic moral order, sometimes personified, sometimes impersonal. Confucius: 天命 (Mandate of Heaven). Mencius: 天 as source of moral nature. Daoist 天道 (Way of Heaven) = natural cosmic pattern. The author rarely uses 天 as technical term—when it appears, usually in citations of traditional philosophy (天道, 天命) or in 自然 (nature, naturalness). Translation: \"Heaven\" for cosmological/moral sense; \"nature\" in compounds like 自然. When romanizing helps clarify traditional concept, use \"Tian\" with gloss.\n   208→\n   209→---\n   210→\n   211→## 理 (lǐ)\n   212→\n   213→- **Main translation**: **\"Principle\"** (Neo-Confucian) or **\"Pattern\"**\n   214→- **Alternatives**: \"Li\" (romanized), \"Coherence,\" \"Underlying order\"\n   215→- **Note**: Extremely important in Neo-Confucian philosophy. Zhu Xi's 理学 (School of Principle): 理 = the coherent pattern/principle inherent in all things, paired with 气 (material force/energy). 理 is what makes things what they are, the intelligible structure. The author does not deeply engage Neo-Confucian 理 theory, but 理 appears in examples and citations. When the author uses 理, often means \"rational principle\" or \"underlying pattern.\" Translation: \"Principle\" for Neo-Confucian contexts (established convention); \"pattern\" emphasizes structural/organizational aspect; \"coherence\" captures the intelligibility dimension. The author's own framework shares some concerns with 理学 (what structures experience?) but approaches differently (through 境 and category theory rather than 理/气 metaphysics).\n   216→\n   217→---\n   218→\n   219→## 气 (qì)\n   220→\n   221→- **Main translation**: **\"Qi\"** (romanized) or **\"Material force\"**\n   222→- **Alternatives**: \"Vital energy,\" \"Ether,\" \"Pneuma\"\n   223→- **Note**: In Neo-Confucian metaphysics (especially Zhu Xi), 气 is material force/energy, paired with 理 (principle). All things are composed of 理 and 气. Earlier: vital energy, breath, life force. The author does not extensively engage 气 theory. When it appears, usually in citations or comparisons with traditional philosophy. Translation: \"Qi\" (romanized) with gloss, or \"material force\" in Neo-Confucian contexts following convention (Wing-tsit Chan translation). \"Vital energy\" works for earlier, less technical uses.\n   224→\n   225→---\n   226→\n   227→## 性 (xìng)\n   228→\n   229→- **Main translation**: **\"Nature\"** or **\"Inherent nature\"**\n   230→- **Alternatives**: \"Xing\" (romanized), \"Natural disposition\"\n   231→- **Note**: Fundamental concept in Chinese ethical philosophy. Mencius: human 性 is originally good (性善). Xunzi: human 性 is originally bad (性恶). Neo-Confucian: 性即理 (nature is principle, Wang Yangming) vs. 性 receives 理 (Zhu Xi). The author's related concept is 德 (inherent character), but 德 is explicitly constructivist while traditional 性 is more essentialist. The author does not extensively theorize 性. When it appears, usually traditional sense. Translation: \"nature\" or \"inherent nature.\" When precision needed, \"natural disposition\" or romanize \"Xing\" with explanation.\n   232→\n   233→---\n   234→\n   235→## 我 (wǒ)\n   236→\n   237→- **Main translation**: **\"I\"** or **\"Self\"**\n   238→- **Alternatives**: \"Ego,\" \"The self\"\n   239→- **Note**: Standard first-person pronoun, but philosophically loaded. The author's account of 我 (in 忒修斯之船 section): \"我\"是那个感受，那个当你提到任何有关我的方面时，都会让我联想到的那个感受 (The \"I\" is that feeling, the one that comes to mind when you mention any aspect related to me). \"我\" is the 范性质 (universal property) of the subcategory of experiences associated with oneself. When we create something (劳动成果), it can become part of \"我\" because seeing it activates the \"我\"-feeling. This is a structural/phenomenological account of selfhood, not a metaphysical substance. Translation: \"I\" for first-person usage; \"the self\" when discussing the concept philosophically; \"the sense of self\" when emphasizing experiential dimension. The author's account resonates with Buddhist 无我 (no-self) but approaches from phenomenological rather than soteriological angle.\n   240→\n   241→---\n   242→\n   243→## 非理性 (fēi lǐ xìng)\n   244→\n   245→- **Main translation**: **\"The non-rational\"** or **\"The irrational\"**\n   246→- **Alternatives**: \"Non-rationality,\" \"That which lies outside reason\"\n   247→- **Note**: Carefully defined by author. Does NOT mean \"unreasonable\" or \"contrary to reason.\" Means: **that which lies outside the scope of reason**; what cannot be grounded in reason but must simply be acknowledged (承认). The author's claim: \"理性的目的必然要在理性之外\" (The purpose of reason must lie outside reason)—reason is instrumental, its goals are non-rational. \"对恒常性的追求本身就是非理性的\" (The pursuit of constancy itself is non-rational). The pursuit of meaning, the desire for metaphysical frameworks—these are 非理性. This is NOT a pejorative—the author insists 非理性 must be *acknowledged* (承认), not suppressed. The author: \"这种非理性是应当被承认的\" (This non-rationality should be acknowledged). In post-metaphysical framework, acknowledging 非理性 is essential. DANGER: \"Irrational\" in English often means \"unreasonable,\" \"crazy,\" \"going against reason.\" The author means something more like \"arational\"—simply outside reason's domain, neither rational nor contra-rational. Best translation: \"the non-rational\" with initial note clarifying this means \"outside reason's scope,\" not \"unreasonable.\" In contexts where this is clear, \"irrational\" acceptable if less awkward, but \"non-rational\" is more precise.\n   248→\n   249→---\n   250→\n   251→## 自我实现 (zì wǒ shí xiàn)\n   252→\n   253→- **Main translation**: **\"Self-realization\"**\n   254→- **Alternatives**: \"Self-actualization\" (avoid—Maslow-specific)\n   255→- **Note**: The author explicitly glosses: \"使得自我得以成为现实\" (making the self become reality). An active, constructive process. The author connects to need for 实践 (practice): \"理想和现象之重叠\" (the overlapping of ideal and phenomena)—we see ourselves in phenomena, \"证实我的存在\" (confirm my existence), make phenomena \"我的一部分\" (part of me) through realizing our ideals in phenomena. This resonates with Hegelian self-realization (Selbstverwirklichung) and Maslow's self-actualization, but the author's emphasis is on the *practical* process of making ideals real in experience, not achieving a pre-given potential. Translation: \"Self-realization\" is standard and adequate. Clarify in context that this is constructive/active, not fulfilling pre-existing essence. \"Realization of self\" works if emphasis on process needed.\n   256→\n   257→---\n   258→\n   259→## 联想 (lián xiǎng)\n   260→\n   261→- **Main translation**: **\"Association\"**\n   262→- **Alternatives**: \"Mental association,\" \"Linking\"\n   263→- **Note**: In category theory formalization, 联想 becomes *morphisms* in the category E (境). Definition: the connections between experiences. Example: seeing a pencil makes me think of a pen—the 联想 links them. The author: \"其中这些对象之间的联系（称之为联想，也是P的一部分，也是一种感受），作为E中的态射\" (The connections between these objects, called associations, are also part of P, also a kind of feeling, and serve as morphisms in E). So associations are themselves *experiences* (part of P) that link other experiences. DANGER: 联想 also means \"imagination\" in Chinese—not the intended sense here. Clarify \"association\" as in \"association of ideas,\" mental linking.

However, causality is just temporal identity). 同一 = recognizing something as the same across time or context. Example: \"我们眼前的一个苹果（的图像），在下一刻，他和这一刻，是同一个东西——既是恒常\" (The apple image before us, in the next moment, is the same thing as this moment—this is constancy).

These are *parts of phenomena* (现象的一部分), not abstract concepts. The abstract concepts (仁义礼) are then *constructed* from these phenomenal instances through projection and generalization. This distinction is CRUCIAL to the reversal argument. Translation: \"Phenomenal X\" preserves the structure; could expand to \"experienced X\" or \"observable X\" depending on context.

Suggested strategy: use \"the Way→Character→Humaneness→Rightness→Ritual sequence\" for top-down, and \"the Ritual→Rightness→Humaneness→Character→Way construction\" for bottom-up. Frequent translator's notes reminding the reader of the reversal are essential.\n   337→\n   338→---\n   339→\n   340→## Concluding Note for Translators\n   341→\n   342→This dictionary represents the terminological core of a genuinely original philosophical project that stands with one foot in the Chinese philosophical tradition and one foot outside it. The author uses traditional vocabulary as a *resource* while fundamentally reinterpreting it.\n   343→\n   344→The greatest danger is **collapsing the author's meaning back into traditional readings**. Every reader familiar with Chinese philosophy will bring expectations about what 道, 德, 仁, 境, etc. mean. The translator must simultaneously *evoke* those traditional resonances (which the author intentionally activates) while *preventing* automatic assimilation to traditional meanings.\n   345→\n   346→**Strategy recommendations**:\n   347→\n   348→1. **Use romanization + gloss** for terms where the gap between traditional and authorial meaning is widest (境, 德, 诗意)\n   349→2. **Use standard translations with heavy apparatus** (footnotes, translator's introduction, glossary) for terms like 道, 仁, 义 where tradition must be acknowledged but reinterpretation foregrounded\n   350→3. **Introduce each major term formally** when it first appears, with a note: \"This term has traditional meaning X, but the author reinterprets it as Y\"\n   351→4. **Create a running glossary** at the back of the translated volume\n   352→5. **Write a substantial translator's introduction** explaining the hermeneutic challenge: the author is *inside* and *beyond* the tradition simultaneously\n   353→\n   354→This is not a translation of classical Chinese philosophy. This is a translation of a 21st-century philosopher *thinking with and through* classical Chinese philosophy to arrive at new positions. The translator must be, like the author, both faithful to tradition and faithful to innovation.\n   355→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

In Chinese Buddhist translation:\n    25→  - **Kumarajiva** used 境 to translate visaya in Yogacara texts, meaning \"object-domain of consciousness\"\n    26→  - **Xuanzang** used 境界 for gocara in Vijnaptimatratasiddhi (成唯識論), meaning \"range of activity\"\n    27→  - Traditional usage: 境 is what consciousness takes as its object, NOT an independent external world\n    28→\n    29→  **Author's transformation**: The author preserves the Buddhist insight that 境 is structured by mind, not \"the world out there,\" but adds unprecedented formal precision through category theory. The author's E is simultaneously: (1) the experiential field (Buddhist visaya), (2) the structure imposed on that field (Yogacara vijnapti-structuring), and (3) a categorical system with tower structure that can be formally analyzed. This is NOT a departure from Buddhist meaning but a mathematical formalization of it.\n    30→\n    31→  **Translation rationale**: \"Realm\" loses the Buddhist resonance and implies ontological independence. \"Sphere\" or \"domain\" are too generic. \"World\" is too ontologically loaded. \"Scape\" (from landscape/dreamscape) preserves the phenomenological (what appears), structured (shaped by mind), and bounded (limited range) dimensions. Use \"E\" in technical passages to maintain the author's formal notation.\n    32→\n    33→---\n    34→\n    35→## 境界\n    36→\n    37→- **Main translation**: \"bounds,\" \"horizon,\" \"domain-and-limit\"\n    38→- **Alternatives**:\n    39→  - \"experiential boundary\" when emphasizing delimitation\n    40→  - \"level of attainment\" when the Buddhist resonance of spiritual progress is relevant\n    41→- **Note**: In Buddhist usage, 境界 carries two overlapping meanings:\n    42→  - **Spatial sense**: the boundary or extent of a domain (e.g., 語言的境界 = the bounds of language)\n    43→  - **Soteriological sense**: level of spiritual attainment (e.g., 菩薩境界 = the level/state of a bodhisattva)\n    44→\n    45→  The author uses primarily the first sense, but the second sense creates resonance when discussing \"清醒的梦境\" (lucid dreamscape) as a transformed state of awareness. The term implies both \"where this domain reaches\" and \"what can be reached within this domain.\"\n    46→\n    47→  **Translation rationale**: \"Bounds\" captures both meanings—spatial limits and accessible range. Avoid \"boundary\" alone (too rigid), \"limit\" alone (too restrictive), \"scope\" (too academic/neutral).\n    48→\n    49→---\n    50→\n    51→## 虚无 / 虚無主義\n    52→\n    53→- **Main translation**: \"nihilism\" (虚無主義), \"the void\" or \"emptiness-as-absence\" (虚无)\n    54→- **Alternatives**:\n    55→  - \"the vacancy\" or \"the absence\" when emphasizing lack\n    56→  - \"nothingness\" when existentialist resonance is appropriate\n    57→- **Note**: **CRITICAL DISTINCTION** from Buddhist 空 (śūnyatā/sunyata):\n    58→\n    59→  **Buddhist 空 (śūnyatā)**: NOT nihilism (断見, uccheda-vada). In Madhyamaka, emptiness (空) means absence of **svabhava** (自性, inherent existence), NOT absence of phenomena. Nagarjuna's MMK 24.18: \"Whatever is dependently originated, that we call emptiness.\" Emptiness is the Middle Way between eternalism and nihilism.\n    60→\n    61→  **Kumarajiva's translation strategy**: Used 空 (empty) rather than 無 (non-being) to avoid confusion with nihilism. The Chinese character 無 (wu) suggests absolute non-existence; 空 (kong) suggests empty-of-something (empty of svabhava).\n    62→\n    63→  **Author's 虚无**: The void LEFT AFTER metaphysics collapses. The author explicitly states: \"Nihilism is not a being, not a doctrine (主义), but an absence, a vacancy (缺位)... nothing is being produced or created anymore.\" This IS the nihilistic extreme (断邊) that Madhyamaka warns against. However, the author does NOT remain here—post-metaphysics is the exit from this void, parallel to the Middle Way.\n    64→\n    65→  **Translation rationale**: Translate 虚无主義 as \"nihilism\" but ALWAYS include translator's note distinguishing from Buddhist emptiness (空). When 虚无 appears alone, consider \"the void\" or \"nihilistic vacancy\" to emphasize the negative, absence-character. Never translate 虚无 as \"emptiness\" (which should be reserved for 空/śūnyatā).\n    66→\n    67→---\n    68→\n    69→## 空\n    70→\n    71→- **Main translation**: \"emptiness\" (when referring to Buddhist śūnyatā), \"empty\" (adjectival)\n    72→- **Alternatives**:\n    73→  - \"void\" only when clearly distinguished from 虚无\n    74→  - \"vacuity\" in philosophical contexts requiring precision\n    75→- **Note**: This term appears rarely in the author's text, but when it does, it carries Buddhist technical meaning:\n    76→\n    77→  **Sanskrit śūnyatā → Chinese 空**: The central concept of Madhyamaka philosophy. Emptiness of svabhava (inherent existence), NOT emptiness of existence. The Diamond Sutra (金剛經): \"All conditioned phenomena are like a dream, an illusion\" (一切有為法，如夢幻泡影) describes emptiness, not non-existence.\n    78→\n    79→  **Author's minimal usage**: In the example \"when we strip away our characteristics... we eventually arrive at 'emptiness' (空),\" the author acknowledges this is the WRONG approach (choosing containment relations on physical objects rather than phenomena as P). The author's framework avoids reifying 空 as a metaphysical ultimate, which aligns with Madhyamaka's rejection of 空 itself as a view to be grasped.\n    80→\n    81→  **Translation rationale**: Use \"emptiness\" for 空 when Buddhist resonance is clear. Never conflate with 虚无. If both terms appear in proximity, use \"emptiness\" (空) vs. \"the void/nihilism\" (虚无) to maintain distinction.\n    82→\n    83→---\n    84→\n    85→## 清醒\n    86→\n    87→- **Main translation**: \"lucid\" (清醒的梦境 = lucid dreamscape)\n    88→- **Alternatives**:\n    89→  - \"wakeful\" or \"clear-seeing\" in non-dreamscape contexts\n    90→  - \"aware\" when emphasizing consciousness without Buddhist overtones\n    91→- **Note**: 清醒 literally means \"clear-awake\" and carries overtones of Buddhist **bodhi** (覺, awakening). In Chinese Buddhist vocabulary:\n    92→  - 覺 (jue): awakening, enlightenment (bodhi)\n    93→  - 覺醒: to awaken (often used for enlightenment experience)\n    94→  - 清醒: everyday term for being awake/sober, but in philosophical context resonates with 覺\n    95→\n    96→  **Author's usage**: \"清醒的梦境\" (lucid dreamscape) describes engagement with meaning-structures WHILE KNOWING they are constructions. This parallels Chan awakening's third stage: \"After enlightenment, mountains are mountains again\" (青原惟信)—return to full engagement with transformed understanding.\n    97→\n    98→  **Difference from Buddhist awakening**: Buddhist 覺 typically implies cessation of fundamental ignorance (avidya/無明). The author's 清醒 is epistemological (knowing the constructedness) rather than soteriological (liberation from suffering). But the structural parallel is profound: both involve seeing-through without disengaging.\n    99→\n   100→  **Translation rationale**: \"Lucid\" captures both \"clear-seeing\" and the dreamscape context (as in \"lucid dreaming\"—knowing you're dreaming while in the dream). Avoid \"awakened\" (too specifically Buddhist) and \"conscious\" (too Cartesian/neutral). \"Wakeful\" is acceptable but less evocative.\n   101→\n   102→---\n   103→\n   104→## 沉醉\n   105→\n   106→- **Main translation**: \"intoxicated\" (沉醉的梦境 = intoxicated dreamscape)\n   107→- **Alternatives**:\n   108→  - \"immersed\" when intoxication metaphor is too strong\n   109→  - \"entranced\" when emphasizing loss of critical awareness\n   110→- **Note**: 沉醉 literally means \"sink-drunk,\" combining submersion (沉) and intoxication (醉). In Buddhist psychology:\n   111→  - **mada** (憍, 醉): intoxication/pride, one of the klesha (煩惱, afflictions)\n   112→  - **moha** (癡): delusion, fundamental ignorance\n   113→\n   114→  **Author's usage**: \"沉醉的梦境\" describes engagement WITHOUT awareness that meaning-structures are constructions. This is faith/belief (信念/信仰) where purpose appears logically groundless but historically conditioned. The metaphor: drunk on the dream, unaware it's a dream.\n   115→\n   116→  **Buddhist parallel**: Corresponds to pre-awakening state, where one takes conceptual constructions (prapanca/戲論) as ultimately real. The intoxication metaphor recalls Buddhist warnings against the \"intoxicants\" (madya/酒) that cloud discernment.\n   117→\n   118→  **Translation rationale**: \"Intoxicated\" preserves the Buddhist resonance of clouded awareness (mada) and the author's metaphor of being \"drunk\" on meaning. Avoid \"unconscious\" (too negative) and \"naive\" (too judgmental). \"Immersed\" is acceptable but loses the critique of clouded judgment.\n   119→\n   120→---\n   121→\n   122→## 梦境\n   123→\n   124→- **Main translation**: \"dreamscape\"\n   125→- **Alternatives**:\n   126→  - \"dream-realm\" when emphasizing bounded domain\n   127→  - \"dream-construction\" when emphasizing constructed nature\n   128→- **Note**: 梦 (dream) + 境 (scape/domain). The author explicitly distinguishes this from \"illusion to be dispelled\":\n   129→\n   130→  **Buddhist dream analogy**:\n   131→  - **svapna** (夢): standard example of emptiness in Madhyamaka and Yogacara\n   132→  - **Diamond Sutra**: \"All conditioned phenomena are like a dream\" (如夢幻泡影)\n   133→  - **Madhyamaka usage**: Dream objects FUNCTION within the dream even though they lack inherent existence. A dream fire can warm a dream body. This is NOT nihilism—it's the Middle Way.\n   134→\n   135→  **Author's usage**: 梦境 is the \"environment\" (環境) in which meaning and purpose can exist. Games, novels, rituals, lived frameworks—all are dreamscapes. The author emphasizes: \"清醒的梦境 still necessarily means full engagement\" (清醒的梦境依旧也必然意味着对梦境的全身心之投入). This perfectly parallels the Buddhist bodhisattva who saves beings while knowing there are no beings to save (Diamond Sutra).\n   136→\n   137→  **Critical point**: The author's 梦境 is NOT illusion (幻) to be escaped but structure to be engaged with lucidly. This aligns with Madhyamaka's insistence that emptiness doesn't negate function.\n   138→\n   139→  **Translation rationale**: \"Dreamscape\" (not just \"dream\") captures the spatial/environmental dimension and the constructed-yet-immersive quality. Avoid \"illusion\" (implies falsity to be rejected), \"fantasy\" (too escapist), \"construct\" (too abstract/clinical).\n   140→\n   141→---\n   142→\n   143→## 觉 / 悟\n   144→\n   145→- **Main translation**: \"awakening\" (覺), \"realization\" (悟), or \"enlightenment\" (覺悟)\n   146→- **Alternatives**:\n   147→  - \"insight\" for 悟 in non-technical contexts\n   148→  - \"bodhi\" (untranslated) when Sanskrit reference is critical\n   149→- **Note**: These terms appear minimally in the author's text but are essential background:\n   150→\n   151→  **Buddhist technical terms**:\n   152→  - **覺 (jue)**: Sanskrit **bodhi** (बोधि), awakening/enlightenment\n   153→  - **悟 (wu)**: realization, insight (often used in Chan for sudden awakening, Japanese **satori**)\n   154→  - **覺悟**: compound meaning awakening-realization, the process or event of enlightenment\n   155→\n   156→  **Chinese translation history**:\n   157→  - Kumarajiva: used 覺 for bodhi, emphasizing awakening aspect\n   158→  - Xuanzang: used 覺 for bodhi, 悟 for pratipatti (realization through practice)\n   159→  - Chan tradition: 悟 becomes central (頓悟 sudden awakening, 漸悟 gradual awakening)\n   160→\n   161→  **Author's non-usage**: The author avoids these terms, using instead 清醒 (lucid) and 承認 (recognition/acknowledgment). This is deliberate—avoiding Buddhist technical vocabulary while arriving at structurally similar insights. When discussing \"what Chan calls 悟,\" use \"awakening.\"\n   162→\n   163→  **Translation rationale**: When these terms appear in explanatory/comparative contexts (discussing Buddhist parallels), use \"awakening\" (覺) and \"realization\" (悟). Maintain distinction from the author's 清醒 (lucid).\n   164→\n   165→---\n   166→\n   167→## 恒常\n   168→\n   169→- **Main translation**: \"constancy\"\n   170→- **Alternatives**:\n   171→  - \"permanence\" only when ontological claim is explicit\n   172→  - \"stability\" when emphasizing functional continuity\n   173→- **Note**: 恒常 (heng chang) = enduring-constant. The author identifies this as \"the core of metaphysics\" (形而上学的核心是恒常):\n   174→\n   175→  **Buddhist contrast: anitya** (無常, impermanence):\n   176→  - **Sanskrit anitya → Chinese 無常**: The first of three marks of existence (trilaksana)\n   177→  - **Buddhist teaching**: Taking the impermanent as permanent (於無常執常) is one of the four cognitive inversions (viparyasa/顛倒)\n   178→  - **Satipatthana Sutta**: Observe arising and passing (samudaya-vaya) in all phenomena\n   179→\n   180→  **Author's analysis**: \"We need to find (pursue) a constancy (恒常) within changing phenomena, so that we can intentionally perform any action with results meaningful to us.\" Constancy is a \"guarantee\" (保證) that same phenomena will REPEAT. This pursuit is non-rational but necessary.\n   181→\n   182→  **Key difference**: Buddhism identifies pursuit of permanence as rooted in **avidya** (ignorance/無明) to be OVERCOME. The author identifies pursuit of constancy as non-rational feature to be RECOGNIZED (承認) and worked with lucidly, not eliminated. This is a different soteriological stance—post-metaphysical constancy-seeking rather than cessation of constancy-seeking.\n   183→\n   184→  **Translation rationale**: \"Constancy\" better than \"permanence\" (which sounds like Buddhist 常/nitya as metaphysical claim). The author's 恒常 is about pursuit of repeatability and stability, not assertion of permanent essences. Avoid \"invariance\" (too mathematical) and \"persistence\" (too weak).\n   185→\n   186→---\n   187→\n   188→## 无常\n   189→\n   190→- **Main translation**: \"impermanence\"\n   191→- **Alternatives**:\n   192→  - \"impermanent\" (adjectival)\n   193→  - \"transience\" when poetic tone is appropriate\n   194→- **Note**: **Buddhist technical term**:\n   195→  - **Sanskrit anitya → Chinese 無常**: Fundamental teaching across all Buddhist schools\n   196→  - **Three marks of existence** (trilaksana/三法印): All conditioned phenomena are impermanent (anicca/無常), suffering (dukkha/苦), non-self (anatta/無我)\n   197→\n   198→  The author's text does not use 无常 frequently, focusing instead on 恒常 (constancy) as the metaphysical drive. The absence is notable—the author approaches from the phenomenology of our pursuit of stability rather than asserting impermanence as ontological truth.\n   199→\n   200→  **Translation rationale**: Use \"impermanence\" (noun) or \"impermanent\" (adjective) for 無常 when discussing Buddhist doctrine.

Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translation Dictionary.md","content":"# Master Orchestrated Translation Dictionary\n\n**Compiled from 8 Expert Perspectives:**\n1. Metaphysics\n2. Phenomenology\n3. Epistemology\n4. Existentialism\n5. Philosophy of Mind\n6. Kantian/Transcendental Philosophy\n7. Chinese Philosophy\n8. Buddhism (Madhyamaka/Yogacara/Chan-Zen)\n\n**Date:** 2026-02-10\n**Purpose:** This is the authoritative reference document for the English translation of the **Jing Ji** (境集) collection. It synthesizes recommendations from all eight expert perspectives into a single consensus dictionary, preserving expert agreement, flagging disagreements, and providing the translator with clear guidance for every key term. Terms are ordered by importance and frequency of use in the essays.\n\n**How to Use This Dictionary:**\n- Each entry shows the consensus translation (or best-judgment call where experts disagree).\n- The **DISAGREEMENT** line appears only when experts propose genuinely different main translations. Stylistic variations (e.g., capitalization) are noted under Alternatives, not flagged as disagreements.\n- Notes synthesize insights from all relevant experts. The goal is to give the translator maximum context in minimum space.\n- A Disagreements Summary at the end collects all disputed terms for the author's review.\n\n---\n\n## 境 (jing)\n\n- **Main translation**: Jing (romanized, as technical term)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"E\" (in formal/category-theoretic passages, as the author uses)\n  - \"experiential realm\" (discursive contexts)\n  - \"experiential field\" / \"experiential milieu\" (Phenomenology)\n  - \"scape\" / \"experiential scape\" (Buddhism)\n  - \"cognitive-scape\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"sphere\" (Metaphysics, in literary contexts)\n- **Note**: This is the single most important and most difficult term in the entire collection. All eight experts agree it resists single-word translation. The author defines it as a category-theoretic structure on phenomena (P): objects are selected experiences (感受), morphisms are associations (联想), and morphisms are also objects (tower structure). It evolves dynamically via functors. The term resonates with Buddhist *visaya*/*gocara* (object-domain of consciousness), Husserl's Lebenswelt, Heidegger's Welt, and the Chinese aesthetic tradition of 意境. The author considers alternative names: \"game, book, adventure, small world, small freedom.\" Six of eight experts recommend keeping \"Jing\" transliterated with an explanatory apparatus on first use; two suggest descriptive glosses (\"experiential field,\" \"scape\"). Do NOT collapse into traditional Buddhist 境界 (spiritual attainment) or aesthetic 意境 -- the author's usage is formally precise. Use \"Jing\" consistently, with \"E\" in mathematical/formal passages.\n\n---\n\n## 现象 (xianxiang)\n\n- **Main translation**: phenomena (plural) / phenomenon (singular)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the phenomenal\" (when used substantively for the field as a whole)\n  - \"phenomenal given\" (emphasizing givenness, Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"appearance\" (only with strong caveat -- see note)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on \"phenomena\" as main translation. The author uses this term with full phenomenological weight, closer to Husserl's *Phanomen* than to Kant's *Erscheinung*. Phenomena are NOT \"mere appearances\" behind which a truer reality hides; they are the indubitable ground of all experience, identified with \"all feelings taken together\" (全部的感受之总和). Phenomena = First Reality (第一实在). This includes sensory input AND the associations/connections between them. The author explicitly states: \"any understanding we have of phenomena is based on phenomena.\" Buddhism expert notes the parallel with Yogacara: 境 is *vijnapti-matra* (appearance-only). Epistemology expert emphasizes: this is \"practical phenomenalism\" -- whether or not things exist beyond phenomena, only phenomena serve as starting points for justification. AVOID translating as \"appearances\" without caveat, as this risks suggesting phenomena are merely apparent.\n\n---\n\n## 感受 (ganshou)\n\n- **Main translation**: feeling\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"felt experience\" (when emphasizing experiential quality)\n  - \"experience\" (when broader scope needed)\n  - \"sensation\" (only when specifically about sensory input)\n  - \"lived experience\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"phenomenal experience\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"affection\" (Phenomenology, in Michel Henry contexts)\n- **Note**: All experts agree this is foundational. The author distinguishes two senses (footnote): (1) received stimuli/information, (2) the \"crystallization, surge, turbulence\" these give rise to. Both are 感受. P (phenomena) = \"全部的感受之总和\" (the totality of all 感受). Meaning and feeling are \"two sides of one body\" (意义和感受即是两面一体). In the categorical framework, both objects (experiences) and morphisms (associations) are 感受 -- this is why E has tower structure. Buddhism expert notes this is broader than Buddhist *vedana* (受, feeling-tone) but includes it. Chinese Philosophy expert warns \"feeling\" in English can trivialize; consider \"felt experience\" when breadth is needed. Phenomenology expert connects to Husserl's *Empfindung* and Michel Henry's material phenomenology.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Phenomenology recommends \"feeling\" as main; Philosophy of Mind recommends \"lived experience\" or \"phenomenal experience\"; Epistemology recommends \"feeling / felt experience\"; Chinese Philosophy recommends \"felt experience\" or \"feeling.\" The core disagreement is between \"feeling\" (simpler, more accessible) and \"lived experience\" / \"phenomenal experience\" (more precise philosophically but heavier). **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"feeling\" as default, switching to \"felt experience\" when the broader phenomenological scope needs emphasis, and \"sensation\" only for explicitly sensory contexts.\n\n---\n\n## 恒常 (hengchang)\n\n- **Main translation**: constancy\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"permanence\" (too strong -- implies timeless eternality; use only in explicit Kantian First Analogy contexts)\n  - \"invariance\" (mathematical/formal contexts)\n  - \"stability\" (when referring to stable structures)\n- **Note**: All eight experts converge on \"constancy\" as the best translation. The author identifies this as \"the core of metaphysics\" (形而上的核心是恒常). It is the non-rational demand we impose on phenomena: that patterns will hold, that the same causes produce the same effects, that identity persists across time. The author connects constancy to identity (同一) and causality (因果), noting \"causality is just temporal identity.\" Chinese Philosophy expert emphasizes this is epistemological/pragmatic, NOT ontological -- we *seek* invariant patterns, not asserting things really are permanent. Buddhism expert notes the critical contrast with Buddhist *anitya* (无常, impermanence): Buddhism sees pursuit of permanence as ignorance to overcome; the author sees pursuit of constancy as a non-rational feature to be *recognized and worked with lucidly*. Metaphysics expert: \"constancy\" avoids the excessive strength of \"permanence\" and the weakness of \"regularity.\"\n\n---\n\n## 诗意 (shiyi)\n\n- **Main translation**: the poetic\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"poetic dwelling\" (Heidegger connection)\n  - \"poetic engagement\" / \"poetic stance\" (emphasizing activity/orientation)\n  - \"poeticality\" (Buddhism expert)\n  - \"*shiyi*\" (untranslated, like *Dasein*; Existentialism)\n- **Note**: This is the author's central positive contribution -- the post-metaphysical existential stance. All experts agree it does NOT mean \"poetry\" in the literary sense. It is defined as \"清醒的梦境\" (the lucid dreamscape): being fully invested in meaning while knowing that meaning is constructed. The author: \"After metaphysics, facing meaning should be poetic.\" Contrasted with 沉醉的梦境 (intoxicated dreamscape = pre-metaphysical belief/faith). Existentialism expert: differs from Nietzsche's voluntaristic *amor fati*, Camus's heroic revolt, and Heidegger's quietistic *Gelassenheit* -- it is active but not heroic, aware but not detached. Chinese Philosophy expert recommends capitalizing \"the Poetic\" to signal philosophical weight. Buddhism expert: this is genuinely novel, not found in Buddhist sources; it is the \"third way\" between intoxication and nihilistic void. Kantian expert: closer to Nietzsche's \"gay science\" than Kant's practical reason.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Buddhism expert recommends \"poeticality\" as main noun form; all others recommend \"the poetic.\" Chinese Philosophy recommends capitalization (\"the Poetic\") for emphasis. **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"the poetic\" as the standard substantive form, with \"poetic\" as adjective. \"Poeticality\" is acceptable as an occasional variant noun. Capitalize (\"the Poetic\") in the translator's introduction and glossary to signal philosophical weight.\n\n---\n\n## 梦境 (mengjing)\n\n- **Main translation**: dreamscape\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"dream-realm\" (emphasizing spatial/bounded quality)\n  - \"experiential milieu\" / \"meaning-field\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"experiential environment\" / \"meaning-world\" (Existentialism)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on \"dreamscape\" as the best main translation. The author explicitly states this is NOT just literal dreaming: \"任何感受都有使得他得以展现的'环境'\" (any feeling has an 'environment' that enables it to manifest). Examples: games, novels, rituals, relationships, daily life. The \"dream\" metaphor captures: (1) constructed/artificial character, (2) immersive quality, (3) capacity to evoke powerful experience despite being constructed. Chinese Philosophy expert recommends \"dream-realm\" as alternative to preserve both 梦 and 境 components. Buddhism expert notes the Diamond Sutra parallel: \"All conditioned phenomena are like a dream\" -- but the author's dreamscape is NOT illusion to be escaped; it is structure to be engaged with lucidly. The dreamscape is where meaning and feeling become \"two sides of one body.\"\n\n---\n\n## 境界 (jingjie)\n\n- **Main translation**: boundary / horizon\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"realm\" (when used to mean a delimited domain)\n  - \"bounds\" (Buddhism expert)\n  - \"domain\" (Phenomenology)\n  - \"sphere\" (Metaphysics)\n  - \"level of attainment\" (when Buddhist spiritual progress resonance is relevant)\n- **Note**: Distinguished from 境 (Jing). This compound (境 + 界 boundary/limit) emphasizes the boundary or limits of a domain. The author uses it in phrases like \"语言的境界\" (the boundary of language). Phenomenology expert: parallel to Husserl's \"horizon\" (*Horizont*). Buddhism expert: carries both spatial sense (extent of domain) and soteriological sense (level of attainment). Chinese Philosophy expert: in its most general sense, \"the world as experienced from a particular standpoint.\" Do NOT confuse with the technical term 境 (Jing). Context determines translation: \"boundary/horizon\" when emphasizing limits, \"realm\" when emphasizing delimited domain.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Metaphysics recommends \"boundary; horizon; limit\" as main. Phenomenology recommends \"realm.\" Buddhism recommends \"bounds, horizon, domain-and-limit.\" Chinese Philosophy recommends \"realm\" or \"experiential realm.\" **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"boundary\" or \"horizon\" when the author discusses limits of a domain; use \"realm\" when the author discusses the domain itself as a bounded space.\n\n---\n\n## 非理性 (feilixing)\n\n- **Main translation**: the non-rational\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"non-rationality\" (nominal form)\n  - \"arational\" (to avoid negative connotation of \"irrational\")\n  - \"extra-rational\" (emphasizing beyond-reason)\n  - \"beyond reason\" (discursive)\n  - AVOID: \"irrational\" (has pejorative connotations; means \"contrary to reason\")\n- **Note**: All eight experts agree this must NOT be translated as \"irrational.\" The author's argument: \"the purpose of reason must lie outside reason\" -- reason is a tool; its goals are non-rational. The pursuit of ultimate reality, the demand for constancy, the need for self-realization -- all are non-rational. This is NOT defective reasoning but a domain outside reason's reach. The author insists: \"this non-rationality should be acknowledged\" (承认). Epistemology expert: resolves the regress problem differently than foundationalism or coherentism -- the regress ends in non-rational commitment, which is accepted rather than disguised. Buddhism expert: parallels Buddhist *tanha* (craving), but Buddhism aims to overcome it while the author aims to recognize it and work with it lucidly. Kantian expert: departure from Kant, for whom reason's demand for the unconditioned is rational.\n\n---\n\n## 形而上 (xing er shang)\n\n- **Main translation**: the metaphysical\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"metaphysical construct(s)\" (when referring to specific constructions)\n  - \"meta-formation\" (Phenomenology)\n  - \"supra-phenomenal\" (Kantian)\n  - \"above-form\" (literal, archaic, use sparingly)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on the critical distinction: 形而上 (the metaphysical, as content/construct) vs. 形而上学 (metaphysics, as discipline). The author reinterprets 形 as 现象 (phenomena), making 形而上 literally \"that which is above/upon phenomena.\" These are constructions we build upon phenomena that claim constancy/universality -- all Second Reality. The author's formal definition: \"a metaphysical m is an association in E, and m is a universal property in some subcategory of E.\" Chinese Philosophy expert emphasizes the author's claim that Chinese philosophy is mostly 有形而上而无形而上学 (has metaphysical frameworks but lacks systematic metaphysical inquiry). Use \"the metaphysical\" (substantive) consistently; never collapse with \"metaphysics\" (the discipline).\n\n---\n\n## 形而上学 (xing er shang xue)\n\n- **Main translation**: metaphysics (the discipline)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"metaphysical inquiry\" (emphasizing investigative aspect)\n  - \"the study of the metaphysical\" (when clarifying distinction from 形而上)\n- **Note**: All experts agree. Derived from the *Yijing* phrase \"形而上者谓之道.\" The author carefully distinguishes this from 形而上. Western metaphysics seeks ultimate reality; Chinese thought more often operates within given metaphysical frameworks. The term was coined by Japanese scholar Inoue Tetsujiro to translate \"metaphysics.\" Standard translation.\n\n---\n\n## 第一实在 (di yi shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: First Reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"primary reality\" (acceptable variant, but \"First\" preserves numbering)\n  - \"phenomenal reality\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"the originary given\" (Phenomenology, scholarly contexts)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on preserving the numbering system. This designates phenomena (现象) as what we encounter first, epistemically and practically. CRITICAL: The author explicitly states (footnote 25) that this is a *name* (名称), not an ontological claim that phenomena are the \"most real\" stuff of reality. It designates epistemic-practical priority: phenomena are indubitable, cannot be bypassed, and are the necessary starting point. \"First\" means first in the order of access, not first in the order of being. Kantian expert: parallels Kant's \"empirical reality\" but precedes all transcendental constitution. Phenomenology expert: parallels Husserl's principle of principles. Capitalize \"First Reality\" when used as technical term.\n\n---\n\n## 第二实在 (di er shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: Second Reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"constructed reality\" (explanatory gloss)\n  - \"constituted reality\" (Phenomenology)\n  - \"interpreted reality\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n- **Note**: All experts agree. Consists of constructions we build upon phenomena -- the \"things\" we posit as persisting objects, the concepts we abstract, the frameworks we assemble. The objective world (客观世界) is explicitly called a \"model\" (模型) based on phenomena. The numbering indicates it is reached second, after phenomena. All metaphysical constructs live here. Whenever we articulate Zeroth Reality, the articulation itself becomes Second Reality. Capitalize \"Second Reality\" as technical term.\n\n---\n\n## 第〇实在 (di ling shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: Zeroth Reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Ultimate Reality\" (as explanatory gloss, but loses structural numbering)\n  - \"Reality-Zero\" (more colloquial)\n  - \"ground reality\" (Buddhism)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on preserving the \"zeroth\" numbering. This is what traditional metaphysics calls 终极实在 (ultimate reality) -- the Dao, the Unmoved Mover, God, the thing-in-itself. The \"zeroth\" numbering is philosophically loaded: it designates a structural placeholder we can never reach from within the system. Whenever articulated, it becomes Second Reality. Metaphysics expert: parallels Kant's unknowable thing-in-itself and Wittgenstein's \"what can be shown but not said.\" Buddhism expert: compares to Yogacara's *parinispanna* (consummate nature) but diverges because the author insists on in-principle inaccessibility. Kantian expert: mirrors Kant's *Grenzbegriff* (limiting concept). AVOID: \"non-reality\" or \"zero reality\" (suggests non-existence rather than inaccessibility). Capitalize \"Zeroth Reality.\"\n\n---\n\n## 实在 (shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the real\" (substantive)\n  - \"actuality\" (when emphasizing concrete existence)\n- **Note**: When used without numerical prefix, 实在 means \"reality\" in the ordinary sense, but the author's framework implies we must always ask: which reality? The three-fold schema (第〇/第一/第二实在) stratifies what counts as \"real\" according to epistemic access and constructive order. Buddhism expert: use \"Reality\" with capital R when part of the numbered system. AVOID: \"substance\" (Aristotelian baggage) or \"being\" (conflates with 存在).\n\n---\n\n## 清醒的梦境 (qingxing de mengjing)\n\n- **Main translation**: the lucid dreamscape\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the self-aware dreamscape\"\n  - \"the reflective dreamscape\"\n- **Note**: The author's term for post-metaphysical, poetic existence: being in a dreamscape while knowing you're in one, yet still fully investing. \"清醒\" (lucid/awake/clear-headed) indicates self-awareness. The author explicitly invokes \"lucid dreaming\" as the metaphor. This is the stance enabled by recognizing the disenchantment of Zeroth Reality. Buddhism expert: parallels Chan awakening's third stage -- \"after enlightenment, mountains are mountains again.\" All experts agree \"lucid dreamscape\" perfectly captures the concept.\n\n---\n\n## 沉醉的梦境 (chenzui de mengjing)\n\n- **Main translation**: the intoxicated dreamscape\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the unreflective dreamscape\"\n  - \"the absorbed dreamscape\"\n- **Note**: Pre-metaphysical existence: being in a dreamscape without knowing you're in one. The author identifies this with belief/faith where purpose appears as logically groundless. Existentialism expert: corresponds to Sartre's *mauvaise foi* but the author is more generous -- intoxication is not moral failing but the natural pre-nihilistic stance.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Phenomenology recommends \"absorbed\" over \"intoxicated\" (more neutral, less pejorative). Chinese Philosophy recommends \"immersed\" or \"intoxicated.\" Buddhism recommends \"intoxicated\" (preserves Buddhist resonance of *mada*, clouded awareness). Existentialism recommends \"intoxicated\" but notes \"immersed\" is acceptable. **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"intoxicated\" as main translation to preserve the author's 沉醉 metaphor (sink-drunk). Note in translator's introduction that this is descriptive, not pejorative.\n\n---\n\n## 清醒 (qingxing)\n\n- **Main translation**: lucid\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"awake\" (acceptable, especially in \"awake within the dream\")\n  - \"wakeful\" (Buddhism)\n  - \"clear-minded\" / \"clear-sighted\"\n- **Note**: All experts converge on \"lucid\" as the best translation. Describes the mode of inhabiting a dreamscape while aware it is constructed. Buddhism expert: carries overtones of Buddhist *bodhi* (awakening) but is epistemological rather than soteriological. Phenomenology expert: parallels Husserl's phenomenological attitude. AVOID: \"awakened\" (too specifically Buddhist); \"conscious\" (too Cartesian/neutral).\n\n---\n\n## 沉醉 (chenzui)\n\n- **Main translation**: intoxicated\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"absorbed\" (Phenomenology)\n  - \"immersed\" (when intoxication metaphor is too strong)\n  - \"entranced\" (poetic contexts)\n- **Note**: Full absorption in a dreamscape without meta-awareness of its constructed nature. Literally \"sink-drunk.\" Buddhism expert: recalls Buddhist warnings against *madya* (intoxicants) that cloud discernment. Existentialism expert: maps onto Heidegger's *das Man* -- not culpable but structural.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Same as 沉醉的梦境 above. Phenomenology recommends \"absorbed\" (neutral); Buddhism/Existentialism/Chinese Philosophy/Metaphysics recommend \"intoxicated\" (faithful to metaphor). **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"intoxicated\" as default; \"absorbed\" when context demands neutrality.\n\n---\n\n## 联想 (lianxiang)\n\n- **Main translation**: association\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"associative connection\" (when emphasizing relational character)\n  - \"cognitive morphism\" (Philosophy of Mind, technical)\n  - \"associative morphism\" (Phenomenology, technical)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on \"association\" as the main translation. In the categorical framework, associations are the morphisms (arrows) connecting experiences within E. Crucially, associations are themselves experiences (感受), which is why E has tower structure. Phenomenology expert: carries the weight of Husserl's passive synthesis through association (*Assoziation*). Philosophy of Mind expert: adds composability -- if A associates to B and B to C, there is a determinate A-to-C association. Metaphysics expert: echoes Hume's \"association of ideas\" but is more structural. Chinese Philosophy expert warns that 联想 also means \"imagination\" in Chinese -- not the intended sense.\n\n---\n\n## 超越 (chaoyue)\n\n- **Main translation**: transcendence (noun) / to transcend (verb)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"going-beyond\" (verbal, less technical)\n  - \"surpass\" (when emphasizing exceeding limits)\n- **Note**: The author uses this in multiple senses: (1) the traditional metaphysical quest for Zeroth Reality (a failed attempt at transcendence); (2) what lies outside the current boundary of thought; (3) immanent self-transformation through practice. True transcendence (reaching Zeroth Reality) is impossible, but dynamic transcendence (evolution of one's experiential sphere) is real. Kantian expert: author's usage is closer to Heidegger's *Uberstieg* than to Kant's transcendental method. AVOID: \"transcendental\" (Kantian term of art) unless specifically discussing Kant.\n\n---\n\n## 超越性 (chaoyuexing)\n\n- **Main translation**: transcendence (as quality/property) / transcendent character\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the transcendent\" (substantive)\n  - \"outward-reaching dimension\" (Existentialism)\n- **Note**: The nominal form, referring to the quality of transcending. Key usage: \"one's own death is transcendent for oneself\" -- death is beyond the boundary of one's experiential sphere. Existentialism expert: sharp critique of Heidegger's *Sein-zum-Tode* -- the death one \"lives toward\" is always one's metaphysical conception of death, not death itself.\n\n---\n\n## 虚无 (xuwu)\n\n- **Main translation**: nothingness / the void\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"nihility\" (formal philosophical contexts)\n  - \"emptiness-as-absence\" (Buddhism, when distinguishing from 空)\n  - AVOID: \"emptiness\" (reserve for Buddhist 空/sunyata)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on the critical distinction from Buddhist 空 (emptiness/sunyata). The author's 虚无 is the void left when the highest values (ultimate reality) collapse -- not a positive entity but an absence. \"Nihilism is not a something, a doctrine, but a nothing, a void.\" Chinese Philosophy expert: 虚 (empty, void) + 无 (nothing) -- simultaneously negative and cosmologically resonant (the Daoist productive void). Existentialism expert: 虚 (without real significance) + 妄 (arrogant, self-deceptive) per the author's own etymological note. Buddhism expert: this IS the nihilistic extreme (*ucchedavada*) that Madhyamaka warns against, but the author does not remain here. NEVER translate 虚无 as \"emptiness\" (which should be reserved for 空).\n\n---\n\n## 虚无主义 (xuwu zhuyi)\n\n- **Main translation**: nihilism\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the condition of nihility\" (when emphasizing state rather than doctrine)\n- **Note**: Standard translation. The author understands nihilism not as a doctrine but as a condition of meaning-loss: \"Nihilism is not produced or created, just as void is not produced or created, but rather because nothing was produced or created -- nothing is here.\" Existentialism expert: arrives through structural rather than historical analysis (contrast Nietzsche). The author's entire project is framed as what comes after nihilism.\n\n---\n\n## 后形而上学 (hou xing er shang xue)\n\n- **Main translation**: post-metaphysics\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"post-metaphysical thinking\" (echoing Habermas)\n- **Note**: All experts agree. Not \"after and done with\" metaphysics but \"after and transformed.\" The author defines it as metaphysics that: (1) takes phenomena as center, (2) acknowledges all 形而上 as constructions upon phenomena, (3) acknowledges non-rationality, (4) centers on practice (实践) as the overlap of ideal and phenomenon. Kantian expert: parallels Kant's limitation of metaphysics but goes further -- accepts non-rationality at the foundation. AVOID: \"postmetaphysics\" (one word) which might suggest a total break rather than transformation.\n\n---\n\n## 前形而上学 (qian xing er shang xue)\n\n- **Main translation**: pre-metaphysics\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"traditional metaphysics\" (the author's own gloss)\n  - \"classical metaphysics\"\n  - \"pre-nihilist metaphysics\" (Chinese Philosophy expert)\n- **Note**: The author's term for the entire Western and Chinese metaphysical traditions before nihilism -- from Thales through Hegel, from the *Yijing* through Neo-Confucianism. The defining feature is pursuit of ultimate reality without awareness that this pursuit is non-rational. The \"pre\" is relative to nihilism, not chronologically primitive.\n\n---\n\n## 存在 (cunzai)\n\n- **Main translation**: existence / being / to exist\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Being\" (capitalized, when discussing ontology or translating Heidegger's *Sein*)\n  - \"existence\" (when asking whether something exists)\n  - \"presence\" (Phenomenology, when emphasizing being-present)\n- **Note**: Context-dependent. The author's framework is cautious about ontology. Existence is tied to presence in phenomena: something exists (for us) insofar as it appears in First Reality or is well-grounded in Second Reality. Existentialism expert: the author shifts from the question of Being to the structure of experiential fields. Phenomenology expert: when the author says phenomena \"存在,\" this is better translated as \"are present/given\" than \"exist\" in a metaphysical sense. Do NOT assume this maps cleanly onto Heidegger's *Sein/Seiende* distinction.\n\n---\n\n## 道 (dao)\n\n- **Main translation**: Dao (transliterated)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the Way\" (traditional rendering, acceptable with contextualization)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on transliteration. The author uses 道 primarily in the 道德仁义礼 sequence analysis, showing it is GENERATED last through progressive generalization from phenomena, not given first as the primordial source. Chinese Philosophy expert: \"genuinely original -- no classical Chinese philosopher has argued that 道 itself is a cognitive construction built from phenomenal observation upward.\" Buddhism expert: parallels *dharma-kaya* or *tathata* but the author emphasizes inaccessibility through articulation. In the category-theoretic framework, 道 appears at different meta-orders depending on whether the construction is top-down or bottom-up. AVOID over-committing to any particular Daoist interpretation.\n\n---\n\n## 德 (de)\n\n- **Main translation**: De (transliterated in philosophical passages); \"inherent character\" (when English gloss needed)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"virtue\" (Confucian moral contexts only)\n  - \"power\" / \"potency\" / \"efficacy\" (Daoist contexts)\n  - \"nature\" (in 人德 = human nature)\n- **Note**: Notoriously difficult. The author analyzes 德 as \"what makes a thing what it is\" (使得人而成为人的东西) -- the collection of properties we inductively generalize and then normatively impose as definitional. Chinese Philosophy expert: \"DANGER: 'Virtue' imports moral connotations the author strips away (德 applies to all things, not just moral agents). 'Essence' imports Western metaphysical baggage.\" Buddhism expert: parallels Buddhist *svabhava* (self-nature) but is relational/functional, not essential.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Metaphysics recommends \"virtue (Confucian) / power (Daoist) / de (transliterated).\" Chinese Philosophy recommends \"De (romanized) or inherent character.\" Buddhism recommends \"virtue (moral) / potency or efficacy (Daoist).\" **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"De\" (transliterated) in philosophical passages about the 道德仁义礼 sequence. Use \"virtue\" only in explicitly Confucian moral contexts. Use \"efficacy\" or \"potency\" in Daoist cosmological contexts. Always include a translator's note on the semantic range.\n\n---\n\n## 本质 (benzhi)\n\n- **Main translation**: essence / essential nature\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"nature\" (less technical)\n  - \"whatness\" (technical, echoing scholastic *quidditas*)\n- **Note**: In the author's post-metaphysical framework, \"essence\" is reinterpreted: not a hidden inner nature but the universal property of a stable subcategory in E. The author replaces intrinsic essence with structural position: \"what is Theseus's ship? It is that experience which you associate with any part of the ship.\" Metaphysics expert: danger of readers importing Aristotelian *ousia*. Standard translation works if the translator tracks the relocation from substance to structure.\n\n---\n\n## 构造 (gouzao)\n\n- **Main translation**: construction / to construct\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"constitution\" (Phenomenology, for Husserl's *Konstitution*)\n  - \"structuration\" (when emphasizing process)\n  - \"synthesis\" (Kantian, when parallel is explicit)\n- **Note**: The author distinguishes description from construction. E (境) is descriptive of P (phenomena), not constructive. However, within the category-theoretic framework, \"构造\" is a specific technical notion: a tower-structure built from base objects (基石). All experts agree on \"construction\" as default; Phenomenology expert recommends \"constitution\" for phenomenological contexts where Husserl's *Konstitution* is paralleled. Kantian expert: parallels Kant's synthesis but is more dynamic and revisable.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Phenomenology recommends \"constitution\" as main translation (to align with Husserl). All others recommend \"construction.\" **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"construction\" as default; \"constitution\" only when explicitly discussing Husserlian parallels. Note: the author's usage is broader than either Husserl's or Kant's.\n\n---\n\n## 实践 (shijian)\n\n- **Main translation**: practice / praxis\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"practical engagement\"\n  - \"praxis\" (Marxist/Aristotelian contexts)\n- **Note**: Core of the author's post-metaphysics. Defined as \"the overlap of ideal and phenomenon\" (理想和现象之重叠). Practice is where metaphysical constructs (Second Reality) and phenomena (First Reality) come together -- where we act in the world guided by concepts. Kantian expert: not Kant's \"practical reason\" (moral/volitional) but closer to pragmatist or Marxist praxis. The author: \"we are creators, poets of our own lives and feelings\" through practice.\n\n---\n\n## 我 (wo)\n\n- **Main translation**: I / self\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the self\" (when discussing the concept philosophically)\n  - \"the I\" (when analyzing 我 as philosophical object)\n  - AVOID: \"ego\" (unless explicitly discussing Husserl's transcendental ego or Freud)\n- **Note**: The author provides a category-theoretic definition: \"'I' is that feeling, the feeling that whenever you mention any aspect related to me, it causes me to associate.\" Formally, \"I\" is the universal property (terminal object) of a subcategory of E containing all experiences related to me. This provides a structural, non-substantialist account of self. Philosophy of Mind expert: aligns with Buddhist Abhidharma analysis (self as conventional designation), Hume's bundle theory, and narrative self theories. Buddhism expert: \"remarkable convergence\" -- the definition IS the Middle Way on self (not eternalism, not nihilism). Chinese Philosophy expert: resonates with Buddhist 无我 (no-self) but approached phenomenologically.\n\n---\n\n## 自我 (ziwo)\n\n- **Main translation**: self (reflexive/philosophical)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"ego\" (only in explicit psychoanalytic contexts)\n  - \"oneself\" (reflexive usage)\n- **Note**: Distinguished from 我 by being reflexive/objectified. While 我 is the first-person subject, 自我 is the self as object of reflection or concern. Philosophy of Mind expert: 自我 emerges at T_1 or higher in the tower structure -- it is the experience of oneself as object of reflection. The author discusses self-transformation: \"based on the present self, through practice, transcend the present self and construct a new self.\"\n\n---\n\n## 自我实现 (ziwo shixian)\n\n- **Main translation**: self-realization\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"self-actualization\" (AVOID -- too Maslow-specific)\n- **Note**: The author glosses: \"making the self become actual/real\" (使得自我得以成为现实). Tied to practice and the overlap of ideal and phenomenon: \"we see ourselves in phenomena, confirm my existence, make phenomena become 'part of me.'\" Echoes Hegel's *Selbstverwirklichung* and Marxist self-realization through labor. \"Self-realization\" captures the making-real better than \"self-actualization.\"\n\n---\n\n## 意义 (yiyi)\n\n- **Main translation**: meaning / significance\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"significance\" (when emphasizing weight)\n  - \"sense\" (when emphasizing intelligibility)\n  - \"purpose\" (when teleological dimension is primary)\n- **Note**: Central to the author's argument: meaning and feeling are \"two sides of one body\" (两面一体). Meaning IS felt experience. The author: \"I boldly surmise that meaning and purpose are in fact the surging of sensibility, the crystallization of experience.\" The attempt to seek meaning externally (向外寻求意义) is the category error that generates absurdity. Existentialism expert: connects to Heidegger's *Befindlichkeit* but is more radical -- meaning cannot be separated from affect.\n\n---\n\n## 理解 (lijie)\n\n- **Main translation**: understanding / to understand\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"comprehension\"\n- **Note**: The author formalizes understanding as a natural transformation between two functorial evolutions: the evolution of a structure and the evolution of one's experience. You understand something when these align coherently. Philosophy of Mind expert: \"revolutionary account\" -- understanding is not correspondence between mind and world but alignment between internal simulation and external structure. Epistemology expert: dissolves the understanding/explanation distinction. Broader than 掌握 (mastery) -- there is a gradient.\n\n---\n\n## 掌握 (zhangwo)\n\n- **Main translation**: mastery / to grasp\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"command\" (emphasizing full competence)\n  - \"complete understanding\"\n- **Note**: Technical term in the natural transformation analysis. To \"grasp\" a formula means the natural transformation component is the identity morphism -- no gap between your derivation and the truth. Epistemology expert: \"a phenomenological notion of knowledge.\" Philosophy of Mind expert: explains why some correct computations don't feel like mastery and why mastery persists across contexts.\n\n---\n\n## 知识 (zhishi)\n\n- **Main translation**: knowledge\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"belief taken to be correct\" (when emphasizing author's deflationary analysis)\n- **Note**: Epistemology expert: the author radically redefines knowledge by collapsing the JTB (Justified True Belief) tripartite analysis. Through the \"access argument,\" truth and justification both reduce to belief in practice. More radical than post-Gettier externalism -- dissolves the knowledge/belief distinction entirely at the practical level.\n\n---\n\n## 信念 (xinnian)\n\n- **Main translation**: belief\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"doxastic state\" (technical epistemological contexts)\n  - \"conviction\" (when emphasizing strength)\n- **Note**: Central to the author's dissolution of JTB. Defined as \"a thought of taking something as true,\" inherently subjective. The author argues all justification reduces to belief (belief-about-belief). Epistemology expert: the Chinese 信念 carries stronger connotations of conviction than English \"belief.\"\n\n---\n\n## 真理 (zhenli)\n\n- **Main translation**: truth\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"objective truth\" (when distinguishing from subjective belief)\n- **Note**: The author's treatment is deflationary and access-focused. \"Truth\" in JTB refers to objective truth, but the author argues this is \"methodologically impossible\" to access. Not anti-realism (no ontological claim) but truth is \"inoperative\" in knowledge formation.\n\n---\n\n## 辩护 / 证成\n\n- **Main translation**: justification\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"warrant\" (emphasizing epistemic entitlement)\n  - \"verification relation\" (in categorical framework)\n- **Note**: Epistemology expert: the author's central thesis is that justification reduces to belief. All justification bases collapse into belief when we ask how we access them. In the K1 framework, verification relations are morphisms in the knowledge category.\n\n---\n\n## 理性 (lixing)\n\n- **Main translation**: reason / rationality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the rational\" (as substantive, contrasted with non-rational)\n  - \"rational faculty\" (when emphasizing Kant's *Vernunft*)\n- **Note**: The author argues reason is a *tool* (工具) whose purposes are non-rational. Kantian expert: this deflates reason from its Kantian status as source of necessary structures and regulative ideals. Epistemology expert: rational justification cannot justify itself without circularity, so rationality's value is non-rationally grounded.\n\n---\n\n## 先验 (xianyan)\n\n- **Main translation**: a priori / transcendental (context-dependent)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"a priori\" (knowledge independent of experience)\n  - \"transcendental\" (conditions of possibility of experience)\n- **Note**: The author's treatment is carefully agnostic. Stable structures S_E preserved under evolution *might* include a priori elements if identified at the earliest cognitive stage. But this is *descriptive*, not transcendental deduction. Kantian expert: \"the form of synthetic a priori knowledge, but the content left to empirical investigation.\" Epistemology expert: naturalizes the a priori.\n\n---\n\n## 综合 (zonghe)\n\n- **Main translation**: synthesis / synthetic\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"integration\" (emphasizing unification)\n- **Note**: Used in contexts about how elements are combined to form higher-level structures. Kantian expert: the author extends Kant's synthetic a priori from mathematics to the domain of meaning. The framework suggests all knowledge is synthetic (constructed from experiential materials).\n\n---\n\n## 体验 (tiyan)\n\n- **Main translation**: lived experience\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"experience\" (when context is clear)\n  - \"Erlebnis\" (scholarly, Husserlian)\n  - \"experiential content\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n- **Note**: Often used interchangeably with 感受, but 体验 tends to emphasize the more integrated, meaning-laden, durational dimension of experience. Closest to Husserl's *Erlebnis*. Kantian expert: closer to Husserl's *Erlebnis* or Dilthey's *Erleben*. Chinese Philosophy expert: emphasizes the \"living-through\" quality.\n\n---\n\n## 经验 (jingyan)\n\n- **Main translation**: experience\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"empirical experience\" (to distinguish from 体验)\n  - \"Erfahrung\" (scholarly, contrasting with *Erlebnis*)\n- **Note**: Carries connotation of accumulated, reflected-upon, empirical experience -- closer to Husserl's *Erfahrung* as opposed to *Erlebnis* (体验). Kantian expert: Kant's *Erfahrung* -- structured, unified cognition of phenomena. Philosophy of Mind expert: marks the boundary between a priori and empirical.\n\n---\n\n## 意识 (yishi)\n\n- **Main translation**: consciousness\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"awareness\" (when emphasizing attentional aspect)\n- **Note**: Philosophy of Mind expert: in the framework, consciousness is the phenomenal field P from which 境 structures are constructed. This aligns with phenomenal consciousness (what-it's-like-ness). Phenomenology expert: when the author discusses 清醒 (lucid), this relates to reflective consciousness.\n\n---\n\n## 认知 (renzhi)\n\n- **Main translation**: cognition / cognitive structure\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"epistemic structure\" (when knowledge-focused)\n- **Note**: The framework distinguishes consciousness (意识, phenomenal field P) from cognition (认知, the category-theoretic structure 境 built upon P). Philosophy of Mind expert: aligns with embodied cognition and enactivism.\n\n---\n\n## 范畴 (fanchou)\n\n- **Main translation**: category\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"范畴论\" = \"category theory\" (the mathematical discipline)\n- **Note**: Dual usage: (1) Kantian categories (pure concepts of understanding), (2) mathematical category theory (objects and morphisms). The author primarily uses sense (2) but the philosophical overlap with sense (1) is intentional. Kantian expert: the author replaces Kant's table of categories with category-theoretic structures -- universal properties replace categories, functors replace schematism, natural transformations replace synthetic unity of apperception.\n\n---\n\n## 泛性质 / 范性质 (fan xingzhi)\n\n- **Main translation**: universal property\n- **Alternatives**: None (standard mathematical terminology)\n- **Note**: From category theory. An object with universal property is characterized by its relationships to all other objects. The author uses this philosophically: universal properties in subcategories of E correspond to what we experience as \"essences\" -- this relocates essence from intrinsic nature to categorical position, from substance to structure. Kantian expert: formalizes what Kant called the \"schema\" of a concept.\n\n---\n\n## 塔式结构 (ta shi jiegou)\n\n- **Main translation**: tower structure\n- **Alternatives**: None needed\n- **Note**: A category where morphisms are also objects, creating ascending levels. E has tower structure because associations (morphisms) are themselves experiences (objects). Formalized as T_0 -> T_1 -> T_2 -> ... -> T_infinity. Philosophy of Mind expert: provides formal model for meta-cognition and higher-order thought. Kantian expert: related to Fichte's reflexive self-positing.\n\n---\n\n## 基石 (jishi)\n\n- **Main translation**: base stone / foundation stone\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"base object\" (more technical)\n  - \"starting point\"\n- **Note**: In the tower-structure construction, base stones are objects designated as foundational. Choosing different base stones gives different \"constructions\" and thus different \"metaphysics.\" The metaphor of \"stone\" suggests solidity/foundation.\n\n---\n\n## 元阶 (yuan jie)\n\n- **Main translation**: meta-order\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"order\" (when clear from context)\n- **Note**: Technical term from the tower-structure construction. An object's \"absolute meta-order\" is which level it first appears; \"relative meta-order\" is defined relative to a chosen base stone. The 道德仁义礼 examples show how the same subcategory can be assigned different meta-orders depending on construction direction.\n\n---\n\n## 态射 / 箭头 (taishe / jiantou)\n\n- **Main translation**: morphism / arrow\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"mapping\" (less technical)\n- **Note**: Standard category theory terms. In the framework, morphisms are associations (联想) between experiences. Philosophy of Mind expert: \"morphisms are as ontologically basic as mental contents.\" The arrows-only formulation collapses the distinction between objects and morphisms at the fundamental level.\n\n---\n\n## 函子 (hanzi)\n\n- **Main translation**: functor\n- **Alternatives**: None (technical term)\n- **Note**: Structure-preserving map between categories. Key applications: evolution functor T: E_t -> E_{t+1} (cognitive development/change); inclusion functors (embedding subcategories); translation functors (mapping between domains). Kantian expert: \"the author's major methodological innovation beyond Kant -- Kant's framework is static; the author introduces dynamics via functors.\"\n\n---\n\n## 自然变换 (ziran bianhua)\n\n- **Main translation**: natural transformation\n- **Alternatives**: None (technical term)\n- **Note**: The author's formalization of understanding (理解). A natural transformation between the evolution of formal structures and the evolution of experience is the condition of understanding. When the component is the identity morphism, this is mastery (掌握). Kantian expert: \"formalizes the schematism and extends it to meaning, aesthetics, and all understanding.\" Philosophy of Mind expert: \"meaning is neither in text/world nor in mind, but in the natural transformation between them.\"\n\n---\n\n## 稳定结构 (wending jiegou)\n\n- **Main translation**: stable structure\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"invariant structure\" (mathematical contexts)\n  - \"structural invariant\"\n- **Note**: The structure S_E preserved under the evolution functor T. Formal counterpart to constancy (恒常). The author conjectures: there exists S_E such that T(S_E) is isomorphic to S_E. Kantian expert: corresponds to Kant's forms of intuition and categories but discovered empirically rather than deduced a priori.\n\n---\n\n## 稳定子范畴 (wending zi fanchou)\n\n- **Main translation**: stable subcategory\n- **Alternatives**: None\n- **Note**: The author conjectures that universal properties in stable subcategories of E correspond to what we experience as \"essences.\" Part of the formal apparatus that \"runs ahead of its interpretation.\"\n\n---\n\n## 认知结构 (renzhi jiegou)\n\n- **Main translation**: cognitive structure\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"epistemic structure\"\n- **Note**: Kantian expert: if part of the stable structure is shown to be necessary for constructing any E from P, it may be called \"cognitive structure\" -- this is a transcendental argument formalized categorically.\n\n---\n\n## 德 / 仁 / 义 / 礼 Sequence\n\n### 仁 (ren)\n\n- **Main translation**: humaneness\n- **Alternatives**: \"benevolence,\" \"fellow-feeling,\" \"Ren\" (transliterated)\n- **Note**: Chinese Philosophy expert recommends \"humaneness\" or \"fellow-feeling\" over \"benevolence\" (too external/active). The author distinguishes 现象仁 (the inner feeling of care) from the theoretical concept. \"Humaneness\" captures the experiential, empathetic dimension.\n\n### 义 (yi)\n\n- **Main translation**: rightness\n- **Alternatives**: \"moral impetus,\" \"sense of obligation\" (author's specific usage), \"Yi\" (transliterated)\n- **Note**: Chinese Philosophy expert: the author treats 义 as the motivational bridge between inner feeling (仁) and outward action (礼) -- \"推动力\" (motivation). \"Righteousness\" is too moralistic.\n\n### 礼 (li)\n\n- **Main translation**: ritual conduct\n- **Alternatives**: \"ritual,\" \"propriety,\" \"patterned behavior\" (when phenomenal immediacy stressed)\n- **Note**: Chinese Philosophy expert: the author distinguishes 现象礼 (observable behavioral patterns) from theoretical/normative 礼. \"Ritual\" in English risks suggesting empty ceremony; \"ritual conduct\" emphasizes behavioral dimension.\n\n### 现象礼 / 现象仁 / 现象义\n\n- **Main translation**: phenomenal ritual / phenomenal humaneness / phenomenal rightness\n- **Alternatives**: \"observable ritual conduct,\" \"felt fellow-feeling,\" \"felt obligation\"\n- **Note**: The author's coinages distinguishing the original experiential basis from the metaphysical constructs. \"现象X\" = \"X as it appears in phenomena before being theorized.\" Crucial to the reversal argument.\n\n---\n\n## 祛魅 (qumei)\n\n- **Main translation**: disenchantment\n- **Alternatives**: None (standard translation of Weber's *Entzauberung*)\n- **Note**: What happens to Zeroth Reality in post-metaphysics: we recognize its \"special status\" was conferred by non-rational impulse, not by actual accessibility. Disenchantment is clarification, not loss.\n\n---\n\n## 终极实在 (zhongji shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: ultimate reality\n- **Alternatives**: \"absolute reality,\" \"fundamental reality\"\n- **Note**: What traditional metaphysics seeks -- technically designated as Zeroth Reality. The author shows this is structurally unreachable. Standard translation.\n\n---\n\n## 客观世界 (keguan shijie)\n\n- **Main translation**: objective world\n- **Alternatives**: \"external world\"\n- **Note**: Key move: \"the objective world is a model (模型) based on phenomena.\" Not metaphysical realism but constructive empiricism. Must be accompanied by notes explaining it is a constructed model (Second Reality).\n\n---\n\n## 同一 (tongyi)\n\n- **Main translation**: identity / sameness\n- **Alternatives**: None needed\n- **Note**: Connected to constancy. \"Causality is just temporal identity.\" Recognizing something as the same across time or context. Standard philosophical translation.\n\n---\n\n## 因果 (yinguo)\n\n- **Main translation**: causality / cause and effect\n- **Alternatives**: None needed\n- **Note**: The author's claim: \"causality is just temporal identity\" -- recognizing causal connections is recognizing constancy across time. Standard translation.\n\n---\n\n## 属性 (shuxing)\n\n- **Main translation**: property / attribute\n- **Alternatives**: \"characteristic\" (less technical)\n- **Note**: Used in the crucial move from property (属性) to definition (定义): what begins as contingent attribute becomes necessary essence. Standard translation.\n\n---\n\n## 定义 (dingyi)\n\n- **Main translation**: definition\n- **Alternatives**: \"to define\" (verbal)\n- **Note**: The transformation from 属性 (property) to 定义 (definition) is central to the author's constructivist account. From \"things CAN have X\" to \"things MUST have X to count as X.\"\n\n---\n\n## 死亡 (siwang)\n\n- **Main translation**: death\n- **Alternatives**: None\n- **Note**: Existentialism expert: philosophically crucial. The author argues death is transcendent (超越性) to oneself, making Heidegger's \"Being-toward-death\" impossible as articulated. \"We cannot actively care about the purpose of life; we can only care about the process of life.\"\n\n---\n\n## 荒谬 (huangmiu)\n\n- **Main translation**: absurdity / the absurd\n- **Alternatives**: \"absurdism\" (the philosophical position)\n- **Note**: Existentialism expert: the author dissolves Camus's absurdity through the cat-raising example, arguing absurdity is an artifact of misdirected intentionality (seeking meaning externally). When meaning is internally generated, absurdity vanishes.\n\n---\n\n## 异化 (yihua)\n\n- **Main translation**: alienation\n- **Alternatives**: \"estrangement,\" \"reification\"\n- **Note**: Existentialism expert: the author reinterprets Camus's absurdity through Marx's concept of alienation. \"When the source of meaning is externalized, the off-tone appears.\"\n\n---\n\n## 反叛 (fanpan)\n\n- **Main translation**: revolt / rebellion\n- **Alternatives**: \"defiance\"\n- **Note**: References Camus's *revolte*. The author reinterprets: revolt is itself internally generated meaning, effective but \"unnecessarily dramatic.\" The cat-raiser has gone beyond revolt.\n\n---\n\n## 自由 (ziyou)\n\n- **Main translation**: freedom\n- **Alternatives**: \"liberty\" (political contexts)\n- **Note**: Existentialism expert: relates to capacity to construct and choose among dreamscapes, but not absolute -- some dreamscapes are unavoidable. Freedom is practical and processual.\n\n---\n\n## 选择 (xuanze)\n\n- **Main translation**: choice\n- **Alternatives**: \"decision\"\n- **Note**: Choice is embedded in practical activity of 境-construction and navigation. The coin-flip example: choice as self-discovery through constructed decision-mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n## 主体间性 (zhuti jianxing)\n\n- **Main translation**: intersubjectivity\n- **Alternatives**: None (technical term)\n- **Note**: Mentioned briefly as a \"solved problem\" but not developed in detail. Standard philosophical terminology.\n\n---\n\n## 意向性 (yixiangxing)\n\n- **Main translation**: intentionality\n- **Alternatives**: None\n- **Note**: Husserl's *Intentionalitat*. Phenomenology expert: structurally encoded in the E-framework -- the tower structure captures the iterability of intentional acts. Not used frequently in the text but conceptually fundamental.\n\n---\n\n## 重整化 (chongzhenghua)\n\n- **Main translation**: renormalization\n- **Alternatives**: None (borrowed from physics)\n- **Note**: The author uses this to describe how macro-level phenomena emerge from micro-level phenomena. Metaphorical, describing phenomenological founding relations.\n\n---\n\n## 篮子 (lanzi)\n\n- **Main translation**: basket (metaphor for cognitive accessibility)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"accessible domain\" (functional)\n  - \"cognitive scope\" (abstract)\n  - \"horizon of thinkability\" (phenomenological)\n- **Note**: Philosophy of Mind expert: crucial metaphor for cognitive closure and thought's boundary. We can only think about what is in the basket. Engages with Colin McGinn's cognitive closure thesis.\n\n---\n\n## 自上而下 / 自下而上\n\n- **Main translation**: top-down / bottom-up\n- **Alternatives**: None needed\n- **Note**: Standard translations. Construction methods for the 道德仁义礼 hierarchy. The reversal between these two directions is central to the author's argument.\n\n---\n\n## 承认 (chengren)\n\n- **Main translation**: acknowledge / recognize\n- **Alternatives**: \"admit\" (when emphasizing acceptance of difficult truth)\n- **Note**: Buddhism expert: pivotal term. The author insists non-rationality \"should be acknowledged\" -- this is the pivot from nihilism to the poetic. Parallels Buddhist *yatha-bhuta* (seeing as it really is) but with different endpoint: lucid engagement rather than liberation.\n\n---\n\n## 空 (kong)\n\n- **Main translation**: emptiness (Buddhist, *sunyata*)\n- **Alternatives**: \"void,\" \"vacuity\"\n- **Note**: Buddhism expert: CRITICAL -- do NOT conflate with 虚无 (nihilistic void). Buddhist emptiness means absence of *svabhava* (inherent existence), not absence of phenomena. The author rarely uses 空 in technical Buddhist sense. When it appears, maintain strict distinction from 虚无.\n\n---\n\n## 无常 (wuchang)\n\n- **Main translation**: impermanence\n- **Alternatives**: \"impermanent\" (adjectival), \"transience\"\n- **Note**: Buddhist technical term (*anitya*). The author focuses on 恒常 (constancy) as the metaphysical drive rather than asserting impermanence. Buddhism expert: notable absence -- the author approaches from the phenomenology of our pursuit of stability.\n\n---\n\n## 缘起 (yuanqi)\n\n- **Main translation**: dependent origination\n- **Alternatives**: \"conditioned arising,\" \"interdependent co-arising\"\n- **Note**: Buddhism expert: though the term rarely appears explicitly, the author's core move embodies it. Objects are defined by morphisms (relations), not intrinsic content -- this is formal expression of *pratityasamutpada*. The tower structure resonates with Hua-yen's *shishi wuai* (interpenetration).\n\n---\n\n## 自性 (zixing)\n\n- **Main translation**: self-nature / inherent existence\n- **Alternatives**: \"intrinsic nature,\" \"*svabhava*\" (transliterated)\n- **Note**: Buddhism expert: Madhyamaka's target. The author rejects internal essences in favor of relational definition, recapitulating the Buddhist rejection of *svabhava* without using the term.\n\n---\n\n## 无我 (wuwo)\n\n- **Main translation**: non-self\n- **Alternatives**: \"no-self,\" \"selflessness\" (ethical), \"*anatman*\" (transliterated)\n- **Note**: Buddhism expert: core Buddhist doctrine. The author rarely uses this term explicitly but the category-theoretic definition of 我 (as universal property, not substance) functionally embodies the *anatman* teaching.\n\n---\n\n## P / E (Formal Symbols)\n\n- **Main translation**: P / E (retain letters)\n- **Gloss**: P = \"the phenomenal field\" or \"the totality of phenomena\"; E = \"Jing\" or \"the structured experiential field\"\n- **Note**: Retain in translation. P stands for Phenomenon, Physical World, Physics. E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, Experience. Full totality written in Fraktur (blackletter) script. Retain all formal notation.\n\n---\n\n## Additional Minor Terms\n\n### 天 (tian)\n- **Main translation**: Heaven (cosmological) / Nature (in compounds)\n- **Note**: Rarely used as technical term by the author. Standard in citations of classical philosophy.\n\n### 理 (li)\n- **Main translation**: principle (Neo-Confucian) / pattern\n- **Note**: Not deeply engaged by the author. Standard when it appears in citations.\n\n### 气 (qi)\n- **Main translation**: Qi (romanized) / material force\n- **Note**: Not extensively engaged by the author.\n\n### 性 (xing)\n- **Main translation**: nature / inherent nature\n- **Note**: Related to author's 德 but traditional 性 is more essentialist. Appears in citations.\n\n### 意境 (yijing)\n- **Main translation**: artistic conception / realm of meaning\n- **Note**: Classical Chinese aesthetic term. Distinct from technical 境 (Jing). Used in traditional sense.\n\n### 觉 / 悟 (jue / wu)\n- **Main translation**: awakening (觉) / realization (悟)\n- **Note**: Buddhist terms. The author deliberately avoids these, using 清醒 (lucid) instead. Maintain distinction.\n\n---\n\n# Disagreements Summary\n\nThis section collects all terms where expert dictionaries proposed genuinely different main translations, for the author's review and resolution.\n\n---\n\n### 1. 感受 (ganshou)\n\n| Expert | Main Recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Metaphysics | feeling; experience; sensation |\n| Phenomenology | feeling |\n| Epistemology | feeling / felt experience |\n| Existentialism | feeling / felt experience |\n| Philosophy of Mind | lived experience / phenomenal experience |\n| Kantian | feeling / sensation |\n| Chinese Philosophy | felt experience / feeling |\n| Buddhism | feeling |\n\n**Tension**: \"Feeling\" is simpler and more accessible but may trivialize (suggesting emotion only). \"Lived experience\" / \"phenomenal experience\" are more precise philosophically but heavier and more academic. \"Felt experience\" is a middle ground.\n\n**Recommendation**: \"Feeling\" as default, \"felt experience\" when broader scope is needed.\n\n---\n\n### 2. 诗意 (shiyi)\n\n| Expert | Main Recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Metaphysics | the poetic |\n| Phenomenology | the poetic |\n| Existentialism | the poetic / poetic dwelling |\n| Philosophy of Mind | (not primary entry) |\n| Kantian | the poetic / poetic engagement |\n| Chinese Philosophy | the Poetic (capitalized) |\n| Buddhism | poeticality |\n\n**Tension**: \"The poetic\" is consensus, but Buddhism expert prefers \"poeticality\" as a noun form. Chinese Philosophy expert insists on capitalization to signal philosophical weight (like \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\").\n\n**Recommendation**: \"The poetic\" as standard; capitalize in glossary and introduction.\n\n---\n\n### 3. 沉醉 / 沉醉的梦境 (chenzui / chenzui de mengjing)\n\n| Expert | Main Recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Metaphysics | intoxicated |\n| Phenomenology | absorbed |\n| Existentialism | intoxicated |\n| Philosophy of Mind | immersion / absorbed engagement / intoxication |\n| Chinese Philosophy | immersed / intoxicated |\n| Buddhism | intoxicated |\n\n**Tension**: \"Intoxicated\" preserves the Chinese metaphor (沉 = sink, 醉 = drunk) and Buddhist resonance (mada, clouded awareness), but carries potentially pejorative English connotations. \"Absorbed\" is more neutral and closer to phenomenological usage (Heidegger's *Verfallen*) but loses the critique of clouded judgment.\n\n**Recommendation**: \"Intoxicated\" as default (faithful to source text); translator's note clarifying this is descriptive, not pejorative.\n\n---\n\n### 4. 境界 (jingjie)\n\n| Expert | Main Recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Metaphysics | boundary; horizon; limit |\n| Phenomenology | realm |\n| Epistemology | (not primary entry) |\n| Kantian | (not primary entry) |\n| Chinese Philosophy | realm / experiential realm |\n| Buddhism | bounds, horizon, domain-and-limit |\n\n**Tension**: \"Boundary/horizon\" emphasizes the limit-character (界); \"realm\" emphasizes the domain-character (境). The author uses both senses.\n\n**Recommendation**: Context-dependent. \"Boundary\" or \"horizon\" when discussing limits; \"realm\" when discussing the domain itself.\n\n---\n\n### 5. 构造 (gouzao)\n\n| Expert | Main Recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Metaphysics | construction |\n| Phenomenology | constitution |\n| Epistemology | construction |\n| Philosophy of Mind | construction / structuring |\n| Kantian | construction / constitute |\n| Chinese Philosophy | (not primary entry) |\n| Buddhism | (not primary entry) |\n\n**Tension**: Phenomenology expert prefers \"constitution\" to align with Husserl's *Konstitution*. All others prefer \"construction.\" The author's usage is broader than Husserl's specific sense.\n\n**Recommendation**: \"Construction\" as default; \"constitution\" only in explicitly Husserlian comparative passages.\n\n---\n\n### 6. 德 (de)\n\n| Expert | Main Recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Metaphysics | virtue / power / de (context-dependent) |\n| Chinese Philosophy | De (romanized) / inherent character |\n| Buddhism | virtue / potency or efficacy |\n\n**Tension**: The term has radically different meanings in Confucian (moral virtue), Daoist (natural potency/efficacy), and the author's (constructivist -- what we decide defines a thing) contexts. \"Virtue\" imports moral connotations inappropriate for the author's general usage. \"Inherent character\" captures the author's sense but loses tradition.\n\n**Recommendation**: \"De\" (transliterated) in philosophical passages; context-specific translations (virtue/efficacy) with translator's notes elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n### 7. 虚无 (xuwu)\n\n| Expert | Main Recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Metaphysics | nothingness; the void |\n| Phenomenology | nothingness |\n| Epistemology | nihility / the void |\n| Existentialism | the void / nothingness |\n| Chinese Philosophy | the void / nothingness |\n| Buddhism | the void / emptiness-as-absence |\n\n**Tension**: Minor. \"Nothingness\" vs. \"the void\" -- both are acceptable. Key consensus: NEVER use \"emptiness\" (reserved for Buddhist 空).\n\n**Recommendation**: Use \"nothingness\" or \"the void\" depending on context; both acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**End of Master Dictionary**\n\nThis document should be used as the authoritative reference for all translation decisions. Where disagreements remain unresolved, the author should make final determinations. All translators should maintain consistency with the choices recorded here.\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":83857,"cache_read_input_tokens":11243,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":83857},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CXzqDfy3MFY5WLfj91mSg","type":"assistant","uuid":"5b79e86c-3cbe-4fae-96f5-7d108144499d","timestamp":"2026-02-10T18:11:59.256Z"}

Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translation Dictionary.md\" << 'ENDOFFILE'\n# Master Orchestrated Translation Dictionary\n\n**Compiled from 8 Expert Perspectives:**\n1. Metaphysics\n2. Phenomenology\n3. Epistemology\n4. Existentialism\n5. Philosophy of Mind\n6. Kantian/Transcendental Philosophy\n7. Chinese Philosophy\n8. Buddhism (Madhyamaka/Yogacara/Chan-Zen)\n\n**Date:** 2026-02-10\n**Purpose:** This is the authoritative reference document for the English translation of the **Jing Ji** (境集) collection. It synthesizes recommendations from all eight expert perspectives into a single consensus dictionary, preserving expert agreement, flagging disagreements, and providing the translator with clear guidance for every key term. Terms are ordered by importance and frequency of use in the essays.\n\n**How to Use This Dictionary:**\n- Each entry shows the consensus translation (or best-judgment call where experts disagree).\n- The **DISAGREEMENT** line appears only when experts propose genuinely different main translations. Stylistic variations (e.g., capitalization) are noted under Alternatives, not flagged as disagreements.\n- Notes synthesize insights from all relevant experts. The goal is to give the translator maximum context in minimum space.\n- A Disagreements Summary at the end collects all disputed terms for the author's review.\n\n---\n\n## 境 (jing)\n\n- **Main translation**: Jing (romanized, as technical term)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"E\" (in formal/category-theoretic passages, as the author uses)\n  - \"experiential realm\" (discursive contexts)\n  - \"experiential field\" / \"experiential milieu\" (Phenomenology)\n  - \"scape\" / \"experiential scape\" (Buddhism)\n  - \"cognitive-scape\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"sphere\" (Metaphysics, in literary contexts)\n- **Note**: This is the single most important and most difficult term in the entire collection. All eight experts agree it resists single-word translation. The author defines it as a category-theoretic structure on phenomena (P): objects are selected experiences (感受), morphisms are associations (联想), and morphisms are also objects (tower structure). It evolves dynamically via functors. The term resonates with Buddhist *visaya*/*gocara* (object-domain of consciousness), Husserl's Lebenswelt, Heidegger's Welt, and the Chinese aesthetic tradition of 意境. The author considers alternative names: \"game, book, adventure, small world, small freedom.\" Six of eight experts recommend keeping \"Jing\" transliterated with an explanatory apparatus on first use; two suggest descriptive glosses (\"experiential field,\" \"scape\"). Do NOT collapse into traditional Buddhist 境界 (spiritual attainment) or aesthetic 意境 -- the author's usage is formally precise. Use \"Jing\" consistently, with \"E\" in mathematical/formal passages.\n\n---\n\n## 现象 (xianxiang)\n\n- **Main translation**: phenomena (plural) / phenomenon (singular)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the phenomenal\" (when used substantively for the field as a whole)\n  - \"phenomenal given\" (emphasizing givenness, Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"appearance\" (only with strong caveat -- see note)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on \"phenomena\" as main translation. The author uses this term with full phenomenological weight, closer to Husserl's *Phanomen* than to Kant's *Erscheinung*. Phenomena are NOT \"mere appearances\" behind which a truer reality hides; they are the indubitable ground of all experience, identified with \"all feelings taken together\" (全部的感受之总和). Phenomena = First Reality (第一实在). This includes sensory input AND the associations/connections between them. The author explicitly states: \"any understanding we have of phenomena is based on phenomena.\" Buddhism expert notes the parallel with Yogacara: 境 is *vijnapti-matra* (appearance-only). Epistemology expert emphasizes: this is \"practical phenomenalism\" -- whether or not things exist beyond phenomena, only phenomena serve as starting points for justification. AVOID translating as \"appearances\" without caveat, as this risks suggesting phenomena are merely apparent.\n\n---\n\n## 感受 (ganshou)\n\n- **Main translation**: feeling\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"felt experience\" (when emphasizing experiential quality)\n  - \"experience\" (when broader scope needed)\n  - \"sensation\" (only when specifically about sensory input)\n  - \"lived experience\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"phenomenal experience\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"affection\" (Phenomenology, in Michel Henry contexts)\n- **Note**: All experts agree this is foundational. The author distinguishes two senses (footnote): (1) received stimuli/information, (2) the \"crystallization, surge, turbulence\" these give rise to. Both are 感受. P (phenomena) = \"全部的感受之总和\" (the totality of all 感受). Meaning and feeling are \"two sides of one body\" (意义和感受即是两面一体). In the categorical framework, both objects (experiences) and morphisms (associations) are 感受 -- this is why E has tower structure. Buddhism expert notes this is broader than Buddhist *vedana* (受, feeling-tone) but includes it. Chinese Philosophy expert warns \"feeling\" in English can trivialize; consider \"felt experience\" when breadth is needed. Phenomenology expert connects to Husserl's *Empfindung* and Michel Henry's material phenomenology.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Phenomenology recommends \"feeling\" as main; Philosophy of Mind recommends \"lived experience\" or \"phenomenal experience\"; Epistemology recommends \"feeling / felt experience\"; Chinese Philosophy recommends \"felt experience\" or \"feeling.\" The core disagreement is between \"feeling\" (simpler, more accessible) and \"lived experience\" / \"phenomenal experience\" (more precise philosophically but heavier). **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"feeling\" as default, switching to \"felt experience\" when the broader phenomenological scope needs emphasis, and \"sensation\" only for explicitly sensory contexts.\n\n---\n\n## 恒常 (hengchang)\n\n- **Main translation**: constancy\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"permanence\" (too strong -- implies timeless eternality; use only in explicit Kantian First Analogy contexts)\n  - \"invariance\" (mathematical/formal contexts)\n  - \"stability\" (when referring to stable structures)\n- **Note**: All eight experts converge on \"constancy\" as the best translation. The author identifies this as \"the core of metaphysics\" (形而上的核心是恒常). It is the non-rational demand we impose on phenomena: that patterns will hold, that the same causes produce the same effects, that identity persists across time. The author connects constancy to identity (同一) and causality (因果), noting \"causality is just temporal identity.\" Chinese Philosophy expert emphasizes this is epistemological/pragmatic, NOT ontological -- we *seek* invariant patterns, not asserting things really are permanent. Buddhism expert notes the critical contrast with Buddhist *anitya* (无常, impermanence): Buddhism sees pursuit of permanence as ignorance to overcome; the author sees pursuit of constancy as a non-rational feature to be *recognized and worked with lucidly*. Metaphysics expert: \"constancy\" avoids the excessive strength of \"permanence\" and the weakness of \"regularity.\"\n\n---\n\n## 诗意 (shiyi)\n\n- **Main translation**: the poetic\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"poetic dwelling\" (Heidegger connection)\n  - \"poetic engagement\" / \"poetic stance\" (emphasizing activity/orientation)\n  - \"poeticality\" (Buddhism expert)\n  - \"*shiyi*\" (untranslated, like *Dasein*; Existentialism)\n- **Note**: This is the author's central positive contribution -- the post-metaphysical existential stance. All experts agree it does NOT mean \"poetry\" in the literary sense. It is defined as \"清醒的梦境\" (the lucid dreamscape): being fully invested in meaning while knowing that meaning is constructed. The author: \"After metaphysics, facing meaning should be poetic.\" Contrasted with 沉醉的梦境 (intoxicated dreamscape = pre-metaphysical belief/faith). Existentialism expert: differs from Nietzsche's voluntaristic *amor fati*, Camus's heroic revolt, and Heidegger's quietistic *Gelassenheit* -- it is active but not heroic, aware but not detached. Chinese Philosophy expert recommends capitalizing \"the Poetic\" to signal philosophical weight. Buddhism expert: this is genuinely novel, not found in Buddhist sources; it is the \"third way\" between intoxication and nihilistic void. Kantian expert: closer to Nietzsche's \"gay science\" than Kant's practical reason.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Buddhism expert recommends \"poeticality\" as main noun form; all others recommend \"the poetic.\" Chinese Philosophy recommends capitalization (\"the Poetic\") for emphasis. **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"the poetic\" as the standard substantive form, with \"poetic\" as adjective. \"Poeticality\" is acceptable as an occasional variant noun. Capitalize (\"the Poetic\") in the translator's introduction and glossary to signal philosophical weight.\n\n---\n\n## 梦境 (mengjing)\n\n- **Main translation**: dreamscape\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"dream-realm\" (emphasizing spatial/bounded quality)\n  - \"experiential milieu\" / \"meaning-field\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"experiential environment\" / \"meaning-world\" (Existentialism)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on \"dreamscape\" as the best main translation. The author explicitly states this is NOT just literal dreaming: \"任何感受都有使得他得以展现的'环境'\" (any feeling has an 'environment' that enables it to manifest). Examples: games, novels, rituals, relationships, daily life. The \"dream\" metaphor captures: (1) constructed/artificial character, (2) immersive quality, (3) capacity to evoke powerful experience despite being constructed. Chinese Philosophy expert recommends \"dream-realm\" as alternative to preserve both 梦 and 境 components. Buddhism expert notes the Diamond Sutra parallel: \"All conditioned phenomena are like a dream\" -- but the author's dreamscape is NOT illusion to be escaped; it is structure to be engaged with lucidly. The dreamscape is where meaning and feeling become \"two sides of one body.\"\n\n---\n\n## 境界 (jingjie)\n\n- **Main translation**: boundary / horizon\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"realm\" (when used to mean a delimited domain)\n  - \"bounds\" (Buddhism expert)\n  - \"domain\" (Phenomenology)\n  - \"sphere\" (Metaphysics)\n  - \"level of attainment\" (when Buddhist spiritual progress resonance is relevant)\n- **Note**: Distinguished from 境 (Jing). This compound (境 + 界 boundary/limit) emphasizes the boundary or limits of a domain. The author uses it in phrases like \"语言的境界\" (the boundary of language). Phenomenology expert: parallel to Husserl's \"horizon\" (*Horizont*). Buddhism expert: carries both spatial sense (extent of domain) and soteriological sense (level of attainment). Chinese Philosophy expert: in its most general sense, \"the world as experienced from a particular standpoint.\" Do NOT confuse with the technical term 境 (Jing). Context determines translation: \"boundary/horizon\" when emphasizing limits, \"realm\" when emphasizing delimited domain.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Metaphysics recommends \"boundary; horizon; limit\" as main. Phenomenology recommends \"realm.\" Buddhism recommends \"bounds, horizon, domain-and-limit.\" Chinese Philosophy recommends \"realm\" or \"experiential realm.\" **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"boundary\" or \"horizon\" when the author discusses limits of a domain; use \"realm\" when the author discusses the domain itself as a bounded space.\n\n---\n\n## 非理性 (feilixing)\n\n- **Main translation**: the non-rational\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"non-rationality\" (nominal form)\n  - \"arational\" (to avoid negative connotation of \"irrational\")\n  - \"extra-rational\" (emphasizing beyond-reason)\n  - \"beyond reason\" (discursive)\n  - AVOID: \"irrational\" (has pejorative connotations; means \"contrary to reason\")\n- **Note**: All eight experts agree this must NOT be translated as \"irrational.\" The author's argument: \"the purpose of reason must lie outside reason\" -- reason is a tool; its goals are non-rational. The pursuit of ultimate reality, the demand for constancy, the need for self-realization -- all are non-rational. This is NOT defective reasoning but a domain outside reason's reach. The author insists: \"this non-rationality should be acknowledged\" (承认). Epistemology expert: resolves the regress problem differently than foundationalism or coherentism -- the regress ends in non-rational commitment, which is accepted rather than disguised. Buddhism expert: parallels Buddhist *tanha* (craving), but Buddhism aims to overcome it while the author aims to recognize it and work with it lucidly. Kantian expert: departure from Kant, for whom reason's demand for the unconditioned is rational.\n\n---\n\n## 形而上 (xing er shang)\n\n- **Main translation**: the metaphysical\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"metaphysical construct(s)\" (when referring to specific constructions)\n  - \"meta-formation\" (Phenomenology)\n  - \"supra-phenomenal\" (Kantian)\n  - \"above-form\" (literal, archaic, use sparingly)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on the critical distinction: 形而上 (the metaphysical, as content/construct) vs. 形而上学 (metaphysics, as discipline). The author reinterprets 形 as 现象 (phenomena), making 形而上 literally \"that which is above/upon phenomena.\" These are constructions we build upon phenomena that claim constancy/universality -- all Second Reality. The author's formal definition: \"a metaphysical m is an association in E, and m is a universal property in some subcategory of E.\" Chinese Philosophy expert emphasizes the author's claim that Chinese philosophy is mostly 有形而上而无形而上学 (has metaphysical frameworks but lacks systematic metaphysical inquiry). Use \"the metaphysical\" (substantive) consistently; never collapse with \"metaphysics\" (the discipline).\n\n---\n\n## 形而上学 (xing er shang xue)\n\n- **Main translation**: metaphysics (the discipline)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"metaphysical inquiry\" (emphasizing investigative aspect)\n  - \"the study of the metaphysical\" (when clarifying distinction from 形而上)\n- **Note**: All experts agree. Derived from the *Yijing* phrase \"形而上者谓之道.\" The author carefully distinguishes this from 形而上. Western metaphysics seeks ultimate reality; Chinese thought more often operates within given metaphysical frameworks. The term was coined by Japanese scholar Inoue Tetsujiro to translate \"metaphysics.\" Standard translation.\n\n---\n\n## 第一实在 (di yi shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: First Reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"primary reality\" (acceptable variant, but \"First\" preserves numbering)\n  - \"phenomenal reality\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"the originary given\" (Phenomenology, scholarly contexts)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on preserving the numbering system. This designates phenomena (现象) as what we encounter first, epistemically and practically. CRITICAL: The author explicitly states (footnote 25) that this is a *name* (名称), not an ontological claim that phenomena are the \"most real\" stuff of reality. It designates epistemic-practical priority: phenomena are indubitable, cannot be bypassed, and are the necessary starting point. \"First\" means first in the order of access, not first in the order of being. Kantian expert: parallels Kant's \"empirical reality\" but precedes all transcendental constitution. Phenomenology expert: parallels Husserl's principle of principles. Capitalize \"First Reality\" when used as technical term.\n\n---\n\n## 第二实在 (di er shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: Second Reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"constructed reality\" (explanatory gloss)\n  - \"constituted reality\" (Phenomenology)\n  - \"interpreted reality\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n- **Note**: All experts agree. Consists of constructions we build upon phenomena -- the \"things\" we posit as persisting objects, the concepts we abstract, the frameworks we assemble. The objective world (客观世界) is explicitly called a \"model\" (模型) based on phenomena. The numbering indicates it is reached second, after phenomena. All metaphysical constructs live here. Whenever we articulate Zeroth Reality, the articulation itself becomes Second Reality. Capitalize \"Second Reality\" as technical term.\n\n---\n\n## 第〇实在 (di ling shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: Zeroth Reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Ultimate Reality\" (as explanatory gloss, but loses structural numbering)\n  - \"Reality-Zero\" (more colloquial)\n  - \"ground reality\" (Buddhism)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on preserving the \"zeroth\" numbering. This is what traditional metaphysics calls 终极实在 (ultimate reality) -- the Dao, the Unmoved Mover, God, the thing-in-itself. The \"zeroth\" numbering is philosophically loaded: it designates a structural placeholder we can never reach from within the system. Whenever articulated, it becomes Second Reality. Metaphysics expert: parallels Kant's unknowable thing-in-itself and Wittgenstein's \"what can be shown but not said.\" Buddhism expert: compares to Yogacara's *parinispanna* (consummate nature) but diverges because the author insists on in-principle inaccessibility. Kantian expert: mirrors Kant's *Grenzbegriff* (limiting concept). AVOID: \"non-reality\" or \"zero reality\" (suggests non-existence rather than inaccessibility). Capitalize \"Zeroth Reality.\"\n\n---\n\n## 实在 (shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the real\" (substantive)\n  - \"actuality\" (when emphasizing concrete existence)\n- **Note**: When used without numerical prefix, 实在 means \"reality\" in the ordinary sense, but the author's framework implies we must always ask: which reality? The three-fold schema (第〇/第一/第二实在) stratifies what counts as \"real\" according to epistemic access and constructive order. Buddhism expert: use \"Reality\" with capital R when part of the numbered system. AVOID: \"substance\" (Aristotelian baggage) or \"being\" (conflates with 存在).\n\n---\n\n## 清醒的梦境 (qingxing de mengjing)\n\n- **Main translation**: the lucid dreamscape\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the self-aware dreamscape\"\n  - \"the reflective dreamscape\"\n- **Note**: The author's term for post-metaphysical, poetic existence: being in a dreamscape while knowing you're in one, yet still fully investing. \"清醒\" (lucid/awake/clear-headed) indicates self-awareness. The author explicitly invokes \"lucid dreaming\" as the metaphor. This is the stance enabled by recognizing the disenchantment of Zeroth Reality. Buddhism expert: parallels Chan awakening's third stage -- \"after enlightenment, mountains are mountains again.\" All experts agree \"lucid dreamscape\" perfectly captures the concept.\n\n---\n\n## 沉醉的梦境 (chenzui de mengjing)\n\n- **Main translation**: the intoxicated dreamscape\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the unreflective dreamscape\"\n  - \"the absorbed dreamscape\"\n- **Note**: Pre-metaphysical existence: being in a dreamscape without knowing you're in one. The author identifies this with belief/faith where purpose appears as logically groundless. Existentialism expert: corresponds to Sartre's *mauvaise foi* but the author is more generous -- intoxication is not moral failing but the natural pre-nihilistic stance.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Phenomenology recommends \"absorbed\" over \"intoxicated\" (more neutral, less pejorative). Chinese Philosophy recommends \"immersed\" or \"intoxicated.\" Buddhism recommends \"intoxicated\" (preserves Buddhist resonance of *mada*, clouded awareness). Existentialism recommends \"intoxicated\" but notes \"immersed\" is acceptable. **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"intoxicated\" as main translation to preserve the author's 沉醉 metaphor (sink-drunk). Note in translator's introduction that this is descriptive, not pejorative.\n\n---\n\n## 清醒 (qingxing)\n\n- **Main translation**: lucid\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"awake\" (acceptable, especially in \"awake within the dream\")\n  - \"wakeful\" (Buddhism)\n  - \"clear-minded\" / \"clear-sighted\"\n- **Note**: All experts converge on \"lucid\" as the best translation. Describes the mode of inhabiting a dreamscape while aware it is constructed. Buddhism expert: carries overtones of Buddhist *bodhi* (awakening) but is epistemological rather than soteriological. Phenomenology expert: parallels Husserl's phenomenological attitude. AVOID: \"awakened\" (too specifically Buddhist); \"conscious\" (too Cartesian/neutral).\n\n---\n\n## 沉醉 (chenzui)\n\n- **Main translation**: intoxicated\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"absorbed\" (Phenomenology)\n  - \"immersed\" (when intoxication metaphor is too strong)\n  - \"entranced\" (poetic contexts)\n- **Note**: Full absorption in a dreamscape without meta-awareness of its constructed nature. Literally \"sink-drunk.\" Buddhism expert: recalls Buddhist warnings against *madya* (intoxicants) that cloud discernment. Existentialism expert: maps onto Heidegger's *das Man* -- not culpable but structural.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Same as 沉醉的梦境 above. Phenomenology recommends \"absorbed\" (neutral); Buddhism/Existentialism/Chinese Philosophy/Metaphysics recommend \"intoxicated\" (faithful to metaphor). **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"intoxicated\" as default; \"absorbed\" when context demands neutrality.\n\n---\n\n## 联想 (lianxiang)\n\n- **Main translation**: association\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"associative connection\" (when emphasizing relational character)\n  - \"cognitive morphism\" (Philosophy of Mind, technical)\n  - \"associative morphism\" (Phenomenology, technical)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on \"association\" as the main translation. In the categorical framework, associations are the morphisms (arrows) connecting experiences within E. Crucially, associations are themselves experiences (感受), which is why E has tower structure. Phenomenology expert: carries the weight of Husserl's passive synthesis through association (*Assoziation*). Philosophy of Mind expert: adds composability -- if A associates to B and B to C, there is a determinate A-to-C association. Metaphysics expert: echoes Hume's \"association of ideas\" but is more structural. Chinese Philosophy expert warns that 联想 also means \"imagination\" in Chinese -- not the intended sense.\n\n---\n\n## 超越 (chaoyue)\n\n- **Main translation**: transcendence (noun) / to transcend (verb)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"going-beyond\" (verbal, less technical)\n  - \"surpass\" (when emphasizing exceeding limits)\n- **Note**: The author uses this in multiple senses: (1) the traditional metaphysical quest for Zeroth Reality (a failed attempt at transcendence); (2) what lies outside the current boundary of thought; (3) immanent self-transformation through practice. True transcendence (reaching Zeroth Reality) is impossible, but dynamic transcendence (evolution of one's experiential sphere) is real. Kantian expert: author's usage is closer to Heidegger's *Uberstieg* than to Kant's transcendental method. AVOID: \"transcendental\" (Kantian term of art) unless specifically discussing Kant.\n\n---\n\n## 超越性 (chaoyuexing)\n\n- **Main translation**: transcendence (as quality/property) / transcendent character\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the transcendent\" (substantive)\n  - \"outward-reaching dimension\" (Existentialism)\n- **Note**: The nominal form, referring to the quality of transcending. Key usage: \"one's own death is transcendent for oneself\" -- death is beyond the boundary of one's experiential sphere. Existentialism expert: sharp critique of Heidegger's *Sein-zum-Tode* -- the death one \"lives toward\" is always one's metaphysical conception of death, not death itself.\n\n---\n\n## 虚无 (xuwu)\n\n- **Main translation**: nothingness / the void\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"nihility\" (formal philosophical contexts)\n  - \"emptiness-as-absence\" (Buddhism, when distinguishing from 空)\n  - AVOID: \"emptiness\" (reserve for Buddhist 空/sunyata)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on the critical distinction from Buddhist 空 (emptiness/sunyata). The author's 虚无 is the void left when the highest values (ultimate reality) collapse -- not a positive entity but an absence. \"Nihilism is not a something, a doctrine, but a nothing, a void.\" Chinese Philosophy expert: 虚 (empty, void) + 无 (nothing) -- simultaneously negative and cosmologically resonant (the Daoist productive void). Existentialism expert: 虚 (without real significance) + 妄 (arrogant, self-deceptive) per the author's own etymological note. Buddhism expert: this IS the nihilistic extreme (*ucchedavada*) that Madhyamaka warns against, but the author does not remain here. NEVER translate 虚无 as \"emptiness\" (which should be reserved for 空).\n\n---\n\n## 虚无主义 (xuwu zhuyi)\n\n- **Main translation**: nihilism\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the condition of nihility\" (when emphasizing state rather than doctrine)\n- **Note**: Standard translation. The author understands nihilism not as a doctrine but as a condition of meaning-loss: \"Nihilism is not produced or created, just as void is not produced or created, but rather because nothing was produced or created -- nothing is here.\" Existentialism expert: arrives through structural rather than historical analysis (contrast Nietzsche). The author's entire project is framed as what comes after nihilism.\n\n---\n\n## 后形而上学 (hou xing er shang xue)\n\n- **Main translation**: post-metaphysics\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"post-metaphysical thinking\" (echoing Habermas)\n- **Note**: All experts agree. Not \"after and done with\" metaphysics but \"after and transformed.\" The author defines it as metaphysics that: (1) takes phenomena as center, (2) acknowledges all 形而上 as constructions upon phenomena, (3) acknowledges non-rationality, (4) centers on practice (实践) as the overlap of ideal and phenomenon. Kantian expert: parallels Kant's limitation of metaphysics but goes further -- accepts non-rationality at the foundation. AVOID: \"postmetaphysics\" (one word) which might suggest a total break rather than transformation.\n\n---\n\n## 前形而上学 (qian xing er shang xue)\n\n- **Main translation**: pre-metaphysics\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"traditional metaphysics\" (the author's own gloss)\n  - \"classical metaphysics\"\n  - \"pre-nihilist metaphysics\" (Chinese Philosophy expert)\n- **Note**: The author's term for the entire Western and Chinese metaphysical traditions before nihilism -- from Thales through Hegel, from the *Yijing* through Neo-Confucianism. The defining feature is pursuit of ultimate reality without awareness that this pursuit is non-rational. The \"pre\" is relative to nihilism, not chronologically primitive.\n\n---\n\n## 存在 (cunzai)\n\n- **Main translation**: existence / being / to exist\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Being\" (capitalized, when discussing ontology or translating Heidegger's *Sein*)\n  - \"existence\" (when asking whether something exists)\n  - \"presence\" (Phenomenology, when emphasizing being-present)\n- **Note**: Context-dependent. The author's framework is cautious about ontology. Existence is tied to presence in phenomena: something exists (for us) insofar as it appears in First Reality or is well-grounded in Second Reality. Existentialism expert: the author shifts from the question of Being to the structure of experiential fields. Phenomenology expert: when the author says phenomena \"存在,\" this is better translated as \"are present/given\" than \"exist\" in a metaphysical sense. Do NOT assume this maps cleanly onto Heidegger's *Sein/Seiende* distinction.\n\n---\n\n## 道 (dao)\n\n- **Main translation**: Dao (transliterated)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the Way\" (traditional rendering, acceptable with contextualization)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on transliteration. The author uses 道 primarily in the 道德仁义礼 sequence analysis, showing it is GENERATED last through progressive generalization from phenomena, not given first as the primordial source. Chinese Philosophy expert: \"genuinely original -- no classical Chinese philosopher has argued that 道 itself is a cognitive construction built from phenomenal observation upward.\" Buddhism expert: parallels *dharma-kaya* or *tathata* but the author emphasizes inaccessibility through articulation. In the category-theoretic framework, 道 appears at different meta-orders depending on whether the construction is top-down or bottom-up. AVOID over-committing to any particular Daoist interpretation.\n\n---\n\n## 德 (de)\n\n- **Main translation**: De (transliterated in philosophical passages); \"inherent character\" (when English gloss needed)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"virtue\" (Confucian moral contexts only)\n  - \"power\" / \"potency\" / \"efficacy\" (Daoist contexts)\n  - \"nature\" (in 人德 = human nature)\n- **Note**: Notoriously difficult. The author analyzes 德 as \"what makes a thing what it is\" (使得人而成为人的东西) -- the collection of properties we inductively generalize and then normatively impose as definitional. Chinese Philosophy expert: \"DANGER: 'Virtue' imports moral connotations the author strips away (德 applies to all things, not just moral agents). 'Essence' imports Western metaphysical baggage.\" Buddhism expert: parallels Buddhist *svabhava* (self-nature) but is relational/functional, not essential.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Metaphysics recommends \"virtue (Confucian) / power (Daoist) / de (transliterated).\" Chinese Philosophy recommends \"De (romanized) or inherent character.\" Buddhism recommends \"virtue (moral) / potency or efficacy (Daoist).\" **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"De\" (transliterated) in philosophical passages about the 道德仁义礼 sequence. Use \"virtue\" only in explicitly Confucian moral contexts. Use \"efficacy\" or \"potency\" in Daoist cosmological contexts. Always include a translator's note on the semantic range.\n\n---\n\n## 本质 (benzhi)\n\n- **Main translation**: essence / essential nature\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"nature\" (less technical)\n  - \"whatness\" (technical, echoing scholastic *quidditas*)\n- **Note**: In the author's post-metaphysical framework, \"essence\" is reinterpreted: not a hidden inner nature but the universal property of a stable subcategory in E. The author replaces intrinsic essence with structural position: \"what is Theseus's ship? It is that experience which you associate with any part of the ship.\" Metaphysics expert: danger of readers importing Aristotelian *ousia*. Standard translation works if the translator tracks the relocation from substance to structure.\n\n---\n\n## 构造 (gouzao)\n\n- **Main translation**: construction / to construct\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"constitution\" (Phenomenology, for Husserl's *Konstitution*)\n  - \"structuration\" (when emphasizing process)\n  - \"synthesis\" (Kantian, when parallel is explicit)\n- **Note**: The author distinguishes description from construction. E (境) is descriptive of P (phenomena), not constructive. However, within the category-theoretic framework, \"构造\" is a specific technical notion: a tower-structure built from base objects (基石). All experts agree on \"construction\" as default; Phenomenology expert recommends \"constitution\" for phenomenological contexts where Husserl's *Konstitution* is paralleled. Kantian expert: parallels Kant's synthesis but is more dynamic and revisable.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Phenomenology recommends \"constitution\" as main translation (to align with Husserl). All others recommend \"construction.\" **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"construction\" as default; \"constitution\" only when explicitly discussing Husserlian parallels. Note: the author's usage is broader than either Husserl's or Kant's.\n\n---\n\n## 实践 (shijian)\n\n- **Main translation**: practice / praxis\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"practical engagement\"\n  - \"praxis\" (Marxist/Aristotelian contexts)\n- **Note**: Core of the author's post-metaphysics. Defined as \"the overlap of ideal and phenomenon\" (理想和现象之重叠). Practice is where metaphysical constructs (Second Reality) and phenomena (First Reality) come together -- where we act in the world guided by concepts. Kantian expert: not Kant's \"practical reason\" (moral/volitional) but closer to pragmatist or Marxist praxis. The author: \"we are creators, poets of our own lives and feelings\" through practice.\n\n---\n\n## 我 (wo)\n\n- **Main translation**: I / self\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the self\" (when discussing the concept philosophically)\n  - \"the I\" (when analyzing 我 as philosophical object)\n  - AVOID: \"ego\" (unless explicitly discussing Husserl's transcendental ego or Freud)\n- **Note**: The author provides a category-theoretic definition: \"'I' is that feeling, the feeling that whenever you mention any aspect related to me, it causes me to associate.\" Formally, \"I\" is the universal property (terminal object) of a subcategory of E containing all experiences related to me. This provides a structural, non-substantialist account of self. Philosophy of Mind expert: aligns with Buddhist Abhidharma analysis (self as conventional designation), Hume's bundle theory, and narrative self theories. Buddhism expert: \"remarkable convergence\" -- the definition IS the Middle Way on self (not eternalism, not nihilism). Chinese Philosophy expert: resonates with Buddhist 无我 (no-self) but approached phenomenologically.\n\n---\n\n## 自我 (ziwo)\n\n- **Main translation**: self (reflexive/philosophical)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"ego\" (only in explicit psychoanalytic contexts)\n  - \"oneself\" (reflexive usage)\n- **Note**: Distinguished from 我 by being reflexive/objectified. While 我 is the first-person subject, 自我 is the self as object of reflection or concern. Philosophy of Mind expert: 自我 emerges at T_1 or higher in the tower structure -- it is the experience of oneself as object of reflection. The author discusses self-transformation: \"based on the present self, through practice, transcend the present self and construct a new self.\"\n\n---\n\n## 自我实现 (ziwo shixian)\n\n- **Main translation**: self-realization\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"self-actualization\" (AVOID -- too Maslow-specific)\n- **Note**: The author glosses: \"making the self become actual/real\" (使得自我得以成为现实). Tied to practice and the overlap of ideal and phenomenon: \"we see ourselves in phenomena, confirm my existence, make phenomena become 'part of me.'\" Echoes Hegel's *Selbstverwirklichung* and Marxist self-realization through labor. \"Self-realization\" captures the making-real better than \"self-actualization.\"\n\n---\n\n## 意义 (yiyi)\n\n- **Main translation**: meaning / significance\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"significance\" (when emphasizing weight)\n  - \"sense\" (when emphasizing intelligibility)\n  - \"purpose\" (when teleological dimension is primary)\n- **Note**: Central to the author's argument: meaning and feeling are \"two sides of one body\" (两面一体). Meaning IS felt experience. The author: \"I boldly surmise that meaning and purpose are in fact the surging of sensibility, the crystallization of experience.\" The attempt to seek meaning externally (向外寻求意义) is the category error that generates absurdity. Existentialism expert: connects to Heidegger's *Befindlichkeit* but is more radical -- meaning cannot be separated from affect.\n\n---\n\n## 理解 (lijie)\n\n- **Main translation**: understanding / to understand\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"comprehension\"\n- **Note**: The author formalizes understanding as a natural transformation between two functorial evolutions: the evolution of a structure and the evolution of one's experience. You understand something when these align coherently. Philosophy of Mind expert: \"revolutionary account\" -- understanding is not correspondence between mind and world but alignment between internal simulation and external structure. Epistemology expert: dissolves the understanding/explanation distinction. Broader than 掌握 (mastery) -- there is a gradient.\n\n---\n\n## 掌握 (zhangwo)\n\n- **Main translation**: mastery / to grasp\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"command\" (emphasizing full competence)\n  - \"complete understanding\"\n- **Note**: Technical term in the natural transformation analysis. To \"grasp\" a formula means the natural transformation component is the identity morphism -- no gap between your derivation and the truth. Epistemology expert: \"a phenomenological notion of knowledge.\" Philosophy of Mind expert: explains why some correct computations don't feel like mastery and why mastery persists across contexts.\n\n---\n\n## 知识 (zhishi)\n\n- **Main translation**: knowledge\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"belief taken to be correct\" (when emphasizing author's deflationary analysis)\n- **Note**: Epistemology expert: the author radically redefines knowledge by collapsing the JTB (Justified True Belief) tripartite analysis. Through the \"access argument,\" truth and justification both reduce to belief in practice. More radical than post-Gettier externalism -- dissolves the knowledge/belief distinction entirely at the practical level.\n\n---\n\n## 信念 (xinnian)\n\n- **Main translation**: belief\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"doxastic state\" (technical epistemological contexts)\n  - \"conviction\" (when emphasizing strength)\n- **Note**: Central to the author's dissolution of JTB. Defined as \"a thought of taking something as true,\" inherently subjective. The author argues all justification reduces to belief (belief-about-belief). Epistemology expert: the Chinese 信念 carries stronger connotations of conviction than English \"belief.\"\n\n---\n\n## 真理 (zhenli)\n\n- **Main translation**: truth\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"objective truth\" (when distinguishing from subjective belief)\n- **Note**: The author's treatment is deflationary and access-focused. \"Truth\" in JTB refers to objective truth, but the author argues this is \"methodologically impossible\" to access. Not anti-realism (no ontological claim) but truth is \"inoperative\" in knowledge formation.\n\n---\n\n## 辩护 / 证成\n\n- **Main translation**: justification\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"warrant\" (emphasizing epistemic entitlement)\n  - \"verification relation\" (in categorical framework)\n- **Note**: Epistemology expert: the author's central thesis is that justification reduces to belief. All justification bases collapse into belief when we ask how we access them. In the K1 framework, verification relations are morphisms in the knowledge category.\n\n---\n\n## 理性 (lixing)\n\n- **Main translation**: reason / rationality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the rational\" (as substantive, contrasted with non-rational)\n  - \"rational faculty\" (when emphasizing Kant's *Vernunft*)\n- **Note**: The author argues reason is a *tool* (工具) whose purposes are non-rational. Kantian expert: this deflates reason from its Kantian status as source of necessary structures and regulative ideals. Epistemology expert: rational justification cannot justify itself without circularity, so rationality's value is non-rationally grounded.\n\n---\n\n## 先验 (xianyan)\n\n- **Main translation**: a priori / transcendental (context-dependent)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"a priori\" (knowledge independent of experience)\n  - \"transcendental\" (conditions of possibility of experience)\n- **Note**: The author's treatment is carefully agnostic. Stable structures S_E preserved under evolution *might* include a priori elements if identified at the earliest cognitive stage. But this is *descriptive*, not transcendental deduction. Kantian expert: \"the form of synthetic a priori knowledge, but the content left to empirical investigation.\" Epistemology expert: naturalizes the a priori.\n\n---\n\n## 综合 (zonghe)\n\n- **Main translation**: synthesis / synthetic\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"integration\" (emphasizing unification)\n- **Note**: Used in contexts about how elements are combined to form higher-level structures. Kantian expert: the author extends Kant's synthetic a priori from mathematics to the domain of meaning. The framework suggests all knowledge is synthetic (constructed from experiential materials).\n\n---\n\n## 体验 (tiyan)\n\n- **Main translation**: lived experience\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"experience\" (when context is clear)\n  - \"Erlebnis\" (scholarly, Husserlian)\n  - \"experiential content\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n- **Note**: Often used interchangeably with 感受, but 体验 tends to emphasize the more integrated, meaning-laden, durational dimension of experience. Closest to Husserl's *Erlebnis*. Kantian expert: closer to Husserl's *Erlebnis* or Dilthey's *Erleben*. Chinese Philosophy expert: emphasizes the \"living-through\" quality.\n\n---\n\n## 经验 (jingyan)\n\n- **Main translation**: experience\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"empirical experience\" (to distinguish from 体验)\n  - \"Erfahrung\" (scholarly, contrasting with *Erlebnis*)\n- **Note**: Carries connotation of accumulated, reflected-upon, empirical experience -- closer to Husserl's *Erfahrung* as opposed to *Erlebnis* (体验). Kantian expert: Kant's *Erfahrung* -- structured, unified cognition of phenomena. Philosophy of Mind expert: marks the boundary between a priori and empirical.\n\n---\n\n## 意识 (yishi)\n\n- **Main translation**: consciousness\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"awareness\" (when emphasizing attentional aspect)\n- **Note**: Philosophy of Mind expert: in the framework, consciousness is the phenomenal field P from which 境 structures are constructed. This aligns with phenomenal consciousness (what-it's-like-ness). Phenomenology expert: when the author discusses 清醒 (lucid), this relates to reflective consciousness.\n\n---\n\n## 认知 (renzhi)\n\n- **Main translation**: cognition / cognitive structure\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"epistemic structure\" (when knowledge-focused)\n- **Note**: The framework distinguishes consciousness (意识, phenomenal field P) from cognition (认知, the category-theoretic structure 境 built upon P). Philosophy of Mind expert: aligns with embodied cognition and enactivism.\n\n---\n\n## 范畴 (fanchou)\n\n- **Main translation**: category\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"范畴论\" = \"category theory\" (the mathematical discipline)\n- **Note**: Dual usage: (1) Kantian categories (pure concepts of understanding), (2) mathematical category theory (objects and morphisms). The author primarily uses sense (2) but the philosophical overlap with sense (1) is intentional. Kantian expert: the author replaces Kant's table of categories with category-theoretic structures -- universal properties replace categories, functors replace schematism, natural transformations replace synthetic unity of apperception.\n\n---\n\n## 泛性质 / 范性质 (fan xingzhi)\n\n- **Main translation**: universal property\n- **Alternatives**: None (standard mathematical terminology)\n- **Note**: From category theory. An object with universal property is characterized by its relationships to all other objects. The author uses this philosophically: universal properties in subcategories of E correspond to what we experience as \"essences\" -- this relocates essence from intrinsic nature to categorical position, from substance to structure. Kantian expert: formalizes what Kant called the \"schema\" of a concept.\n\n---\n\n## 塔式结构 (ta shi jiegou)\n\n- **Main translation**: tower structure\n- **Alternatives**: None needed\n- **Note**: A category where morphisms are also objects, creating ascending levels. E has tower structure because associations (morphisms) are themselves experiences (objects). Formalized as T_0 -> T_1 -> T_2 -> ... -> T_infinity. Philosophy of Mind expert: provides formal model for meta-cognition and higher-order thought. Kantian expert: related to Fichte's reflexive self-positing.\n\n---\n\n## 基石 (jishi)\n\n- **Main translation**: base stone / foundation stone\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"base object\" (more technical)\n  - \"starting point\"\n- **Note**: In the tower-structure construction, base stones are objects designated as foundational. Choosing different base stones gives different \"constructions\" and thus different \"metaphysics.\" The metaphor of \"stone\" suggests solidity/foundation.\n\n---\n\n## 元阶 (yuan jie)\n\n- **Main translation**: meta-order\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"order\" (when clear from context)\n- **Note**: Technical term from the tower-structure construction. An object's \"absolute meta-order\" is which level it first appears; \"relative meta-order\" is defined relative to a chosen base stone. The 道德仁义礼 examples show how the same subcategory can be assigned different meta-orders depending on construction direction.\n\n---\n\n## 态射 / 箭头 (taishe / jiantou)\n\n- **Main translation**: morphism / arrow\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"mapping\" (less technical)\n- **Note**: Standard category theory terms. In the framework, morphisms are associations (联想) between experiences. Philosophy of Mind expert: \"morphisms are as ontologically basic as mental contents.\" The arrows-only formulation collapses the distinction between objects and morphisms at the fundamental level.\n\n---\n\n## 函子 (hanzi)\n\n- **Main translation**: functor\n- **Alternatives**: None (technical term)\n- **Note**: Structure-preserving map between categories. Key applications: evolution functor T: E_t -> E_{t+1} (cognitive development/change); inclusion functors (embedding subcategories); translation functors (mapping between domains). Kantian expert: \"the author's major methodological innovation beyond Kant -- Kant's framework is static; the author introduces dynamics via functors.\"\n\n---\n\n## 自然变换 (ziran bianhua)\n\n- **Main translation**: natural transformation\n- **Alternatives**: None (technical term)\n- **Note**: The author's formalization of understanding (理解). A natural transformation between the evolution of formal structures and the evolution of experience is the condition of understanding. When the component is the identity morphism, this is mastery (掌握). Kantian expert: \"formalizes the schematism and extends it to meaning, aesthetics, and all understanding.\" Philosophy of Mind expert: \"meaning is neither in text/world nor in mind, but in the natural transformation between them.\"\n\n---\n\n## 稳定结构 (wending jiegou)\n\n- **Main translation**: stable structure\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"invariant structure\" (mathematical contexts)\n  - \"structural invariant\"\n- **Note**: The structure S_E preserved under the evolution functor T. Formal counterpart to constancy (恒常). The author conjectures: there exists S_E such that T(S_E) is isomorphic to S_E. Kantian expert: corresponds to Kant's forms of intuition and categories but discovered empirically rather than deduced a priori.\n\n---\n\n## 稳定子范畴 (wending zi fanchou)\n\n- **Main translation**: stable subcategory\n- **Alternatives**: None\n- **Note**: The author conjectures that universal properties in stable subcategories of E correspond to what we experience as \"essences.\" Part of the formal apparatus that \"runs ahead of its interpretation.\"\n\n---\n\n## 认知结构 (renzhi jiegou)\n\n- **Main translation**: cognitive structure\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"epistemic structure\"\n- **Note**: Kantian expert: if part of the stable structure is shown to be necessary for constructing any E from P, it may be called \"cognitive structure\" -- this is a transcendental argument formalized categorically.\n\n---\n\n## The 道德仁义礼 Sequence\n\n### 仁 (ren)\n\n- **Main translation**: humaneness\n- **Alternatives**: \"benevolence,\" \"fellow-feeling,\" \"Ren\" (transliterated)\n- **Note**: Chinese Philosophy expert recommends \"humaneness\" or \"fellow-feeling\" over \"benevolence\" (too external/active). The author distinguishes 现象仁 (the inner feeling of care) from the theoretical concept. \"Humaneness\" captures the experiential, empathetic dimension.\n\n### 义 (yi)\n\n- **Main translation**: rightness\n- **Alternatives**: \"moral impetus,\" \"sense of obligation\" (author's specific usage), \"Yi\" (transliterated)\n- **Note**: Chinese Philosophy expert: the author treats 义 as the motivational bridge between inner feeling (仁) and outward action (礼) -- \"推动力\" (motivation). \"Righteousness\" is too moralistic.\n\n### 礼 (li)\n\n- **Main translation**: ritual conduct\n- **Alternatives**: \"ritual,\" \"propriety,\" \"patterned behavior\" (when phenomenal immediacy stressed)\n- **Note**: Chinese Philosophy expert: the author distinguishes 现象礼 (observable behavioral patterns) from theoretical/normative 礼. \"Ritual\" in English risks suggesting empty ceremony; \"ritual conduct\" emphasizes behavioral dimension.\n\n### 现象礼 / 现象仁 / 现象义\n\n- **Main translation**: phenomenal ritual / phenomenal humaneness / phenomenal rightness\n- **Alternatives**: \"observable ritual conduct,\" \"felt fellow-feeling,\" \"felt obligation\"\n- **Note**: The author's coinages distinguishing the original experiential basis from the metaphysical constructs. \"现象X\" = \"X as it appears in phenomena before being theorized.\" Crucial to the reversal argument.\n\n---\n\n## 祛魅 (qumei)\n\n- **Main translation**: disenchantment\n- **Alternatives**: None (standard translation of Weber's *Entzauberung*)\n- **Note**: What happens to Zeroth Reality in post-metaphysics: we recognize its \"special status\" was conferred by non-rational impulse, not by actual accessibility. Disenchantment is clarification, not loss.\n\n---\n\n## 终极实在 (zhongji shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: ultimate reality\n- **Alternatives**: \"absolute reality,\" \"fundamental reality\"\n- **Note**: What traditional metaphysics seeks -- technically designated as Zeroth Reality. The author shows this is structurally unreachable. Standard translation.\n\n---\n\n## 客观世界 (keguan shijie)\n\n- **Main translation**: objective world\n- **Alternatives**: \"external world\"\n- **Note**: Key move: \"the objective world is a model (模型) based on phenomena.\" Not metaphysical realism but constructive empiricism. Must be accompanied by notes explaining it is a constructed model (Second Reality).\n\n---\n\n## 同一 (tongyi)\n\n- **Main translation**: identity / sameness\n- **Alternatives**: None needed\n- **Note**: Connected to constancy. \"Causality is just temporal identity.\" Recognizing something as the same across time or context. Standard philosophical translation.\n\n---\n\n## 因果 (yinguo)\n\n- **Main translation**: causality / cause and effect\n- **Alternatives**: None needed\n- **Note**: The author's claim: \"causality is just temporal identity\" -- recognizing causal connections is recognizing constancy across time. Standard translation.\n\n---\n\n## 属性 (shuxing)\n\n- **Main translation**: property / attribute\n- **Alternatives**: \"characteristic\" (less technical)\n- **Note**: Used in the crucial move from property (属性) to definition (定义): what begins as contingent attribute becomes necessary essence. Standard translation.\n\n---\n\n## 定义 (dingyi)\n\n- **Main translation**: definition\n- **Alternatives**: \"to define\" (verbal)\n- **Note**: The transformation from 属性 (property) to 定义 (definition) is central to the author's constructivist account. From \"things CAN have X\" to \"things MUST have X to count as X.\"\n\n---\n\n## 死亡 (siwang)\n\n- **Main translation**: death\n- **Alternatives**: None\n- **Note**: Existentialism expert: philosophically crucial. The author argues death is transcendent (超越性) to oneself, making Heidegger's \"Being-toward-death\" impossible as articulated. \"We cannot actively care about the purpose of life; we can only care about the process of life.\"\n\n---\n\n## 荒谬 (huangmiu)\n\n- **Main translation**: absurdity / the absurd\n- **Alternatives**: \"absurdism\" (the philosophical position)\n- **Note**: Existentialism expert: the author dissolves Camus's absurdity through the cat-raising example, arguing absurdity is an artifact of misdirected intentionality (seeking meaning externally). When meaning is internally generated, absurdity vanishes.\n\n---\n\n## 异化 (yihua)\n\n- **Main translation**: alienation\n- **Alternatives**: \"estrangement,\" \"reification\"\n- **Note**: Existentialism expert: the author reinterprets Camus's absurdity through Marx's concept of alienation. \"When the source of meaning is externalized, the off-tone appears.\"\n\n---\n\n## 反叛 (fanpan)\n\n- **Main translation**: revolt / rebellion\n- **Alternatives**: \"defiance\"\n- **Note**: References Camus's *revolte*. The author reinterprets: revolt is itself internally generated meaning, effective but \"unnecessarily dramatic.\" The cat-raiser has gone beyond revolt.\n\n---\n\n## 自由 (ziyou)\n\n- **Main translation**: freedom\n- **Alternatives**: \"liberty\" (political contexts)\n- **Note**: Existentialism expert: relates to capacity to construct and choose among dreamscapes, but not absolute -- some dreamscapes are unavoidable. Freedom is practical and processual.\n\n---\n\n## 选择 (xuanze)\n\n- **Main translation**: choice\n- **Alternatives**: \"decision\"\n- **Note**: Choice is embedded in practical activity of Jing-construction and navigation. The coin-flip example: choice as self-discovery through constructed decision-mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n## 主体间性 (zhuti jianxing)\n\n- **Main translation**: intersubjectivity\n- **Alternatives**: None (technical term)\n- **Note**: Mentioned briefly as a \"solved problem\" but not developed in detail. Standard philosophical terminology.\n\n---\n\n## 意向性 (yixiangxing)\n\n- **Main translation**: intentionality\n- **Alternatives**: None\n- **Note**: Husserl's *Intentionalitat*. Phenomenology expert: structurally encoded in the E-framework -- the tower structure captures the iterability of intentional acts. Not used frequently in the text but conceptually fundamental.\n\n---\n\n## 重整化 (chongzhenghua)\n\n- **Main translation**: renormalization\n- **Alternatives**: None (borrowed from physics)\n- **Note**: The author uses this to describe how macro-level phenomena emerge from micro-level phenomena. Metaphorical, describing phenomenological founding relations.\n\n---\n\n## 篮子 (lanzi)\n\n- **Main translation**: basket (metaphor for cognitive accessibility)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"accessible domain\" (functional)\n  - \"cognitive scope\" (abstract)\n  - \"horizon of thinkability\" (phenomenological)\n- **Note**: Philosophy of Mind expert: crucial metaphor for cognitive closure and thought's boundary. We can only think about what is in the basket. Engages with Colin McGinn's cognitive closure thesis.\n\n---\n\n## 自上而下 / 自下而上\n\n- **Main translation**: top-down / bottom-up\n- **Alternatives**: None needed\n- **Note**: Standard translations. Construction methods for the 道德仁义礼 hierarchy. The reversal between these two directions is central to the author's argument.\n\n---\n\n## 承认 (chengren)\n\n- **Main translation**: acknowledge / recognize\n- **Alternatives**: \"admit\" (when emphasizing acceptance of difficult truth)\n- **Note**: Buddhism expert: pivotal term. The author insists non-rationality \"should be acknowledged\" -- this is the pivot from nihilism to the poetic. Parallels Buddhist *yatha-bhuta* (seeing as it really is) but with different endpoint: lucid engagement rather than liberation.\n\n---\n\n## 空 (kong)\n\n- **Main translation**: emptiness (Buddhist, *sunyata*)\n- **Alternatives**: \"void,\" \"vacuity\"\n- **Note**: Buddhism expert: CRITICAL -- do NOT conflate with 虚无 (nihilistic void). Buddhist emptiness means absence of *svabhava* (inherent existence), not absence of phenomena. The author rarely uses 空 in technical Buddhist sense. When it appears, maintain strict distinction from 虚无.\n\n---\n\n## 无常 (wuchang)\n\n- **Main translation**: impermanence\n- **Alternatives**: \"impermanent\" (adjectival), \"transience\"\n- **Note**: Buddhist technical term (*anitya*). The author focuses on 恒常 (constancy) as the metaphysical drive rather than asserting impermanence. Buddhism expert: notable absence -- the author approaches from the phenomenology of our pursuit of stability.\n\n---\n\n## 缘起 (yuanqi)\n\n- **Main translation**: dependent origination\n- **Alternatives**: \"conditioned arising,\" \"interdependent co-arising\"\n- **Note**: Buddhism expert: though the term rarely appears explicitly, the author's core move embodies it. Objects are defined by morphisms (relations), not intrinsic content -- this is formal expression of *pratityasamutpada*. The tower structure resonates with Hua-yen's *shishi wuai* (interpenetration).\n\n---\n\n## 自性 (zixing)\n\n- **Main translation**: self-nature / inherent existence\n- **Alternatives**: \"intrinsic nature,\" \"*svabhava*\" (transliterated)\n- **Note**: Buddhism expert: Madhyamaka's target. The author rejects internal essences in favor of relational definition, recapitulating the Buddhist rejection of *svabhava* without using the term.\n\n---\n\n## 无我 (wuwo)\n\n- **Main translation**: non-self\n- **Alternatives**: \"no-self,\" \"selflessness\" (ethical), \"*anatman*\" (transliterated)\n- **Note**: Buddhism expert: core Buddhist doctrine. The author rarely uses this term explicitly but the category-theoretic definition of 我 (as universal property, not substance) functionally embodies the *anatman* teaching.\n\n---\n\n## P / E (Formal Symbols)\n\n- **Main translation**: P / E (retain letters)\n- **Gloss**: P = \"the phenomenal field\" or \"the totality of phenomena\"; E = \"Jing\" or \"the structured experiential field\"\n- **Note**: Retain in translation. P stands for Phenomenon, Physical World, Physics. E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, Experience. Full totality written in Fraktur (blackletter) script. Retain all formal notation.\n\n---\n\n## Additional Minor Terms\n\n### 天 (tian)\n- **Main translation**: Heaven (cosmological) / Nature (in compounds)\n- **Note**: Rarely used as technical term by the author. Standard in citations of classical philosophy.\n\n### 理 (li)\n- **Main translation**: principle (Neo-Confucian) / pattern\n- **Note**: Not deeply engaged by the author. Standard when it appears in citations.\n\n### 气 (qi)\n- **Main translation**: Qi (romanized) / material force\n- **Note**: Not extensively engaged by the author.\n\n### 性 (xing)\n- **Main translation**: nature / inherent nature\n- **Note**: Related to author's 德 but traditional 性 is more essentialist. Appears in citations.\n\n### 意境 (yijing)\n- **Main translation**: artistic conception / realm of meaning\n- **Note**: Classical Chinese aesthetic term. Distinct from technical 境 (Jing). Used in traditional sense.\n\n### 觉 / 悟 (jue / wu)\n- **Main translation**: awakening (觉) / realization (悟)\n- **Note**: Buddhist terms. The author deliberately avoids these, using 清醒 (lucid) instead. Maintain distinction.\n\n---\n\n# Disagreements Summary\n\nThis section collects all terms where expert dictionaries proposed genuinely different main translations, for the author's review and resolution.\n\n---\n\n### 1. 感受 (ganshou)\n\n| Expert | Main Recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Metaphysics | feeling; experience; sensation |\n| Phenomenology | feeling |\n| Epistemology | feeling / felt experience |\n| Existentialism | feeling / felt experience |\n| Philosophy of Mind | lived experience / phenomenal experience |\n| Kantian | feeling / sensation |\n| Chinese Philosophy | felt experience / feeling |\n| Buddhism | feeling |\n\n**Tension**: \"Feeling\" is simpler and more accessible but may trivialize (suggesting emotion only). \"Lived experience\" / \"phenomenal experience\" are more precise philosophically but heavier and more academic. \"Felt experience\" is a middle ground.\n\n**Recommendation**: \"Feeling\" as default, \"felt experience\" when broader scope is needed.\n\n---\n\n### 2. 诗意 (shiyi)\n\n| Expert | Main Recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Metaphysics | the poetic |\n| Phenomenology | the poetic |\n| Existentialism | the poetic / poetic dwelling |\n| Philosophy of Mind | (not primary entry) |\n| Kantian | the poetic / poetic engagement |\n| Chinese Philosophy | the Poetic (capitalized) |\n| Buddhism | poeticality |\n\n**Tension**: \"The poetic\" is consensus, but Buddhism expert prefers \"poeticality\" as a noun form. Chinese Philosophy expert insists on capitalization to signal philosophical weight (like \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\").\n\n**Recommendation**: \"The poetic\" as standard; capitalize in glossary and introduction.\n\n---\n\n### 3. 沉醉 / 沉醉的梦境 (chenzui / chenzui de mengjing)\n\n| Expert | Main Recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Metaphysics | intoxicated |\n| Phenomenology | absorbed |\n| Existentialism | intoxicated |\n| Philosophy of Mind | immersion / absorbed engagement / intoxication |\n| Chinese Philosophy | immersed / intoxicated |\n| Buddhism | intoxicated |\n\n**Tension**: \"Intoxicated\" preserves the Chinese metaphor (沉 = sink, 醉 = drunk) and Buddhist resonance (mada, clouded awareness), but carries potentially pejorative English connotations. \"Absorbed\" is more neutral and closer to phenomenological usage (Heidegger's *Verfallen*) but loses the critique of clouded judgment.\n\n**Recommendation**: \"Intoxicated\" as default (faithful to source text); translator's note clarifying this is descriptive, not pejorative.\n\n---\n\n### 4. 境界 (jingjie)\n\n| Expert | Main Recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Metaphysics | boundary; horizon; limit |\n| Phenomenology | realm |\n| Epistemology | (not primary entry) |\n| Kantian | (not primary entry) |\n| Chinese Philosophy | realm / experiential realm |\n| Buddhism | bounds, horizon, domain-and-limit |\n\n**Tension**: \"Boundary/horizon\" emphasizes the limit-character (界); \"realm\" emphasizes the domain-character (境). The author uses both senses.\n\n**Recommendation**: Context-dependent. \"Boundary\" or \"horizon\" when discussing limits; \"realm\" when discussing the domain itself.\n\n---\n\n### 5. 构造 (gouzao)\n\n| Expert | Main Recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Metaphysics | construction |\n| Phenomenology | constitution |\n| Epistemology | construction |\n| Philosophy of Mind | construction / structuring |\n| Kantian | construction / constitute |\n| Chinese Philosophy | (not primary entry) |\n| Buddhism | (not primary entry) |\n\n**Tension**: Phenomenology expert prefers \"constitution\" to align with Husserl's *Konstitution*. All others prefer \"construction.\" The author's usage is broader than Husserl's specific sense.\n\n**Recommendation**: \"Construction\" as default; \"constitution\" only in explicitly Husserlian comparative passages.\n\n---\n\n### 6. 德 (de)\n\n| Expert | Main Recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Metaphysics | virtue / power / de (context-dependent) |\n| Chinese Philosophy | De (romanized) / inherent character |\n| Buddhism | virtue / potency or efficacy |\n\n**Tension**: The term has radically different meanings in Confucian (moral virtue), Daoist (natural potency/efficacy), and the author's (constructivist -- what we decide defines a thing) contexts. \"Virtue\" imports moral connotations inappropriate for the author's general usage. \"Inherent character\" captures the author's sense but loses tradition.\n\n**Recommendation**: \"De\" (transliterated) in philosophical passages; context-specific translations (virtue/efficacy) with translator's notes elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n### 7. 虚无 (xuwu)\n\n| Expert | Main Recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Metaphysics | nothingness; the void |\n| Phenomenology | nothingness |\n| Epistemology | nihility / the void |\n| Existentialism | the void / nothingness |\n| Chinese Philosophy | the void / nothingness |\n| Buddhism | the void / emptiness-as-absence |\n\n**Tension**: Minor. \"Nothingness\" vs. \"the void\" -- both are acceptable. Key consensus: NEVER use \"emptiness\" (reserved for Buddhist 空).\n\n**Recommendation**: Use \"nothingness\" or \"the void\" depending on context; both acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**End of Master Dictionary**\n\nThis document should be used as the authoritative reference for all translation decisions. Where disagreements remain unresolved, the author should make final determinations. All translators should maintain consistency with the choices recorded here.\nENDOFFILE","description":"Write the master translation dictionary to the workspace","timeout":30000}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":227,"cache_read_input_tokens":111710,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":227},"output_tokens":25,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CXzqgv5cNnqzr3B2yELFi","type":"assistant","uuid":"16ad7d41-4650-4af2-a54e-597f363d72d1","timestamp":"2026-02-10T18:18:15.195Z"}

Epistemology\n4. Existentialism\n5. Philosophy of Mind\n6. Kantian/Transcendental Philosophy\n7. Chinese Philosophy\n8. Buddhism (Madhyamaka/Yogacara/Chan-Zen)\n\n**Date:** 2026-02-10\n**Purpose:** This is the authoritative reference document for the English translation of the **Jing Ji** (境集) collection. It synthesizes recommendations from all eight expert perspectives into a single consensus dictionary, preserving expert agreement, flagging disagreements, and providing the translator with clear guidance for every key term. Terms are ordered by importance and frequency of use in the essays.\n\n**How to Use This Dictionary:**\n- Each entry shows the consensus translation (or best-judgment call where experts disagree).\n- The **DISAGREEMENT** line appears only when experts propose genuinely different main translations. Stylistic variations (e.g., capitalization) are noted under Alternatives, not flagged as disagreements.\n- Notes synthesize insights from all relevant experts. The goal is to give the translator maximum context in minimum space.\n- A Disagreements Summary at the end collects all disputed terms for the author's review.\n\n---\n\n## 境 (jing)\n\n- **Main translation**: Jing (romanized, as technical term)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"E\" (in formal/category-theoretic passages, as the author uses)\n  - \"experiential realm\" (discursive contexts)\n  - \"experiential field\" / \"experiential milieu\" (Phenomenology)\n  - \"scape\" / \"experiential scape\" (Buddhism)\n  - \"cognitive-scape\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"sphere\" (Metaphysics, in literary contexts)\n- **Note**: This is the single most important and most difficult term in the entire collection. All eight experts agree it resists single-word translation. The author defines it as a category-theoretic structure on phenomena (P): objects are selected experiences (感受), morphisms are associations (联想), and morphisms are also objects (tower structure). It evolves dynamically via functors. The term resonates with Buddhist *visaya*/*gocara* (object-domain of consciousness), Husserl's Lebenswelt, Heidegger's Welt, and the Chinese aesthetic tradition of 意境. The author considers alternative names: \"game, book, adventure, small world, small freedom.\" Six of eight experts recommend keeping \"Jing\" transliterated with an explanatory apparatus on first use; two suggest descriptive glosses (\"experiential field,\" \"scape\"). Do NOT collapse into traditional Buddhist 境界 (spiritual attainment) or aesthetic 意境 -- the author's usage is formally precise. Use \"Jing\" consistently, with \"E\" in mathematical/formal passages.\n\n---\n\n## 现象 (xianxiang)\n\n- **Main translation**: phenomena (plural) / phenomenon (singular)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the phenomenal\" (when used substantively for the field as a whole)\n  - \"phenomenal given\" (emphasizing givenness, Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"appearance\" (only with strong caveat -- see note)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on \"phenomena\" as main translation. The author uses this term with full phenomenological weight, closer to Husserl's *Phanomen* than to Kant's *Erscheinung*. Phenomena are NOT \"mere appearances\" behind which a truer reality hides; they are the indubitable ground of all experience, identified with \"all feelings taken together\" (全部的感受之总和). Phenomena = First Reality (第一实在). This includes sensory input AND the associations/connections between them. The author explicitly states: \"any understanding we have of phenomena is based on phenomena.\" Buddhism expert notes the parallel with Yogacara: 境 is *vijnapti-matra* (appearance-only). Epistemology expert emphasizes: this is \"practical phenomenalism\" -- whether or not things exist beyond phenomena, only phenomena serve as starting points for justification. AVOID translating as \"appearances\" without caveat, as this risks suggesting phenomena are merely apparent.\n\n---\n\n## 感受 (ganshou)\n\n- **Main translation**: feeling\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"felt experience\" (when emphasizing experiential quality)\n  - \"experience\" (when broader scope needed)\n  - \"sensation\" (only when specifically about sensory input)\n  - \"lived experience\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"phenomenal experience\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"affection\" (Phenomenology, in Michel Henry contexts)\n- **Note**: All experts agree this is foundational. The author distinguishes two senses (footnote): (1) received stimuli/information, (2) the \"crystallization, surge, turbulence\" these give rise to. Both are 感受. P (phenomena) = \"全部的感受之总和\" (the totality of all 感受). Meaning and feeling are \"two sides of one body\" (意义和感受即是两面一体). In the categorical framework, both objects (experiences) and morphisms (associations) are 感受 -- this is why E has tower structure. Buddhism expert notes this is broader than Buddhist *vedana* (受, feeling-tone) but includes it. Chinese Philosophy expert warns \"feeling\" in English can trivialize; consider \"felt experience\" when breadth is needed. Phenomenology expert connects to Husserl's *Empfindung* and Michel Henry's material phenomenology.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Phenomenology recommends \"feeling\" as main; Philosophy of Mind recommends \"lived experience\" or \"phenomenal experience\"; Epistemology recommends \"feeling / felt experience\"; Chinese Philosophy recommends \"felt experience\" or \"feeling.\" The core disagreement is between \"feeling\" (simpler, more accessible) and \"lived experience\" / \"phenomenal experience\" (more precise philosophically but heavier). **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"feeling\" as default, switching to \"felt experience\" when the broader phenomenological scope needs emphasis, and \"sensation\" only for explicitly sensory contexts.\n\n---\n\n## 恒常 (hengchang)\n\n- **Main translation**: constancy\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"permanence\" (too strong -- implies timeless eternality; use only in explicit Kantian First Analogy contexts)\n  - \"invariance\" (mathematical/formal contexts)\n  - \"stability\" (when referring to stable structures)\n- **Note**: All eight experts converge on \"constancy\" as the best translation. The author identifies this as \"the core of metaphysics\" (形而上的核心是恒常). It is the non-rational demand we impose on phenomena: that patterns will hold, that the same causes produce the same effects, that identity persists across time. The author connects constancy to identity (同一) and causality (因果), noting \"causality is just temporal identity.\" Chinese Philosophy expert emphasizes this is epistemological/pragmatic, NOT ontological -- we *seek* invariant patterns, not asserting things really are permanent. Buddhism expert notes the critical contrast with Buddhist *anitya* (无常, impermanence): Buddhism sees pursuit of permanence as ignorance to overcome; the author sees pursuit of constancy as a non-rational feature to be *recognized and worked with lucidly*. Metaphysics expert: \"constancy\" avoids the excessive strength of \"permanence\" and the weakness of \"regularity.\"\n\n---\n\n## 诗意 (shiyi)\n\n- **Main translation**: the poetic\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"poetic dwelling\" (Heidegger connection)\n  - \"poetic engagement\" / \"poetic stance\" (emphasizing activity/orientation)\n  - \"poeticality\" (Buddhism expert)\n  - \"*shiyi*\" (untranslated, like *Dasein*; Existentialism)\n- **Note**: This is the author's central positive contribution -- the post-metaphysical existential stance. All experts agree it does NOT mean \"poetry\" in the literary sense. It is defined as \"清醒的梦境\" (the lucid dreamscape): being fully invested in meaning while knowing that meaning is constructed. The author: \"After metaphysics, facing meaning should be poetic.\" Contrasted with 沉醉的梦境 (intoxicated dreamscape = pre-metaphysical belief/faith). Existentialism expert: differs from Nietzsche's voluntaristic *amor fati*, Camus's heroic revolt, and Heidegger's quietistic *Gelassenheit* -- it is active but not heroic, aware but not detached. Chinese Philosophy expert recommends capitalizing \"the Poetic\" to signal philosophical weight. Buddhism expert: this is genuinely novel, not found in Buddhist sources; it is the \"third way\" between intoxication and nihilistic void. Kantian expert: closer to Nietzsche's \"gay science\" than Kant's practical reason.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Buddhism expert recommends \"poeticality\" as main noun form; all others recommend \"the poetic.\" Chinese Philosophy recommends capitalization (\"the Poetic\") for emphasis. **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"the poetic\" as the standard substantive form, with \"poetic\" as adjective. \"Poeticality\" is acceptable as an occasional variant noun. Capitalize (\"the Poetic\") in the translator's introduction and glossary to signal philosophical weight.\n\n---\n\n## 梦境 (mengjing)\n\n- **Main translation**: dreamscape\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"dream-realm\" (emphasizing spatial/bounded quality)\n  - \"experiential milieu\" / \"meaning-field\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"experiential environment\" / \"meaning-world\" (Existentialism)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on \"dreamscape\" as the best main translation. The author explicitly states this is NOT just literal dreaming: \"任何感受都有使得他得以展现的'环境'\" (any feeling has an 'environment' that enables it to manifest). Examples: games, novels, rituals, relationships, daily life. The \"dream\" metaphor captures: (1) constructed/artificial character, (2) immersive quality, (3) capacity to evoke powerful experience despite being constructed. Chinese Philosophy expert recommends \"dream-realm\" as alternative to preserve both 梦 and 境 components. Buddhism expert notes the Diamond Sutra parallel: \"All conditioned phenomena are like a dream\" -- but the author's dreamscape is NOT illusion to be escaped; it is structure to be engaged with lucidly. The dreamscape is where meaning and feeling become \"two sides of one body.\"\n\n---\n\n## 境界 (jingjie)\n\n- **Main translation**: boundary / horizon\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"realm\" (when used to mean a delimited domain)\n  - \"bounds\" (Buddhism expert)\n  - \"domain\" (Phenomenology)\n  - \"sphere\" (Metaphysics)\n  - \"level of attainment\" (when Buddhist spiritual progress resonance is relevant)\n- **Note**: Distinguished from 境 (Jing). This compound (境 + 界 boundary/limit) emphasizes the boundary or limits of a domain. The author uses it in phrases like \"语言的境界\" (the boundary of language). Phenomenology expert: parallel to Husserl's \"horizon\" (*Horizont*). Buddhism expert: carries both spatial sense (extent of domain) and soteriological sense (level of attainment). Chinese Philosophy expert: in its most general sense, \"the world as experienced from a particular standpoint.\" Do NOT confuse with the technical term 境 (Jing). Context determines translation: \"boundary/horizon\" when emphasizing limits, \"realm\" when emphasizing delimited domain.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Metaphysics recommends \"boundary; horizon; limit\" as main. Phenomenology recommends \"realm.\" Buddhism recommends \"bounds, horizon, domain-and-limit.\" Chinese Philosophy recommends \"realm\" or \"experiential realm.\" **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"boundary\" or \"horizon\" when the author discusses limits of a domain; use \"realm\" when the author discusses the domain itself as a bounded space.\n\n---\n\n## 非理性 (feilixing)\n\n- **Main translation**: the non-rational\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"non-rationality\" (nominal form)\n  - \"arational\" (to avoid negative connotation of \"irrational\")\n  - \"extra-rational\" (emphasizing beyond-reason)\n  - \"beyond reason\" (discursive)\n  - AVOID: \"irrational\" (has pejorative connotations; means \"contrary to reason\")\n- **Note**: All eight experts agree this must NOT be translated as \"irrational.\" The author's argument: \"the purpose of reason must lie outside reason\" -- reason is a tool; its goals are non-rational. The pursuit of ultimate reality, the demand for constancy, the need for self-realization -- all are non-rational. This is NOT defective reasoning but a domain outside reason's reach. The author insists: \"this non-rationality should be acknowledged\" (承认). Epistemology expert: resolves the regress problem differently than foundationalism or coherentism -- the regress ends in non-rational commitment, which is accepted rather than disguised. Buddhism expert: parallels Buddhist *tanha* (craving), but Buddhism aims to overcome it while the author aims to recognize it and work with it lucidly. Kantian expert: departure from Kant, for whom reason's demand for the unconditioned is rational.\n\n---\n\n## 形而上 (xing er shang)\n\n- **Main translation**: the metaphysical\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"metaphysical construct(s)\" (when referring to specific constructions)\n  - \"meta-formation\" (Phenomenology)\n  - \"supra-phenomenal\" (Kantian)\n  - \"above-form\" (literal, archaic, use sparingly)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on the critical distinction: 形而上 (the metaphysical, as content/construct) vs. 形而上学 (metaphysics, as discipline). The author reinterprets 形 as 现象 (phenomena), making 形而上 literally \"that which is above/upon phenomena.\" These are constructions we build upon phenomena that claim constancy/universality -- all Second Reality. The author's formal definition: \"a metaphysical m is an association in E, and m is a universal property in some subcategory of E.\" Chinese Philosophy expert emphasizes the author's claim that Chinese philosophy is mostly 有形而上而无形而上学 (has metaphysical frameworks but lacks systematic metaphysical inquiry). Use \"the metaphysical\" (substantive) consistently; never collapse with \"metaphysics\" (the discipline).\n\n---\n\n## 形而上学 (xing er shang xue)\n\n- **Main translation**: metaphysics (the discipline)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"metaphysical inquiry\" (emphasizing investigative aspect)\n  - \"the study of the metaphysical\" (when clarifying distinction from 形而上)\n- **Note**: All experts agree. Derived from the *Yijing* phrase \"形而上者谓之道.\" The author carefully distinguishes this from 形而上. Western metaphysics seeks ultimate reality; Chinese thought more often operates within given metaphysical frameworks. The term was coined by Japanese scholar Inoue Tetsujiro to translate \"metaphysics.\" Standard translation.\n\n---\n\n## 第一实在 (di yi shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: First Reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"primary reality\" (acceptable variant, but \"First\" preserves numbering)\n  - \"phenomenal reality\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"the originary given\" (Phenomenology, scholarly contexts)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on preserving the numbering system. This designates phenomena (现象) as what we encounter first, epistemically and practically. CRITICAL: The author explicitly states (footnote 25) that this is a *name* (名称), not an ontological claim that phenomena are the \"most real\" stuff of reality. It designates epistemic-practical priority: phenomena are indubitable, cannot be bypassed, and are the necessary starting point. \"First\" means first in the order of access, not first in the order of being. Kantian expert: parallels Kant's \"empirical reality\" but precedes all transcendental constitution. Phenomenology expert: parallels Husserl's principle of principles. Capitalize \"First Reality\" when used as technical term.\n\n---\n\n## 第二实在 (di er shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: Second Reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"constructed reality\" (explanatory gloss)\n  - \"constituted reality\" (Phenomenology)\n  - \"interpreted reality\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n- **Note**: All experts agree. Consists of constructions we build upon phenomena -- the \"things\" we posit as persisting objects, the concepts we abstract, the frameworks we assemble. The objective world (客观世界) is explicitly called a \"model\" (模型) based on phenomena. The numbering indicates it is reached second, after phenomena. All metaphysical constructs live here. Whenever we articulate Zeroth Reality, the articulation itself becomes Second Reality. Capitalize \"Second Reality\" as technical term.\n\n---\n\n## 第〇实在 (di ling shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: Zeroth Reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Ultimate Reality\" (as explanatory gloss, but loses structural numbering)\n  - \"Reality-Zero\" (more colloquial)\n  - \"ground reality\" (Buddhism)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on preserving the \"zeroth\" numbering. This is what traditional metaphysics calls 终极实在 (ultimate reality) -- the Dao, the Unmoved Mover, God, the thing-in-itself. The \"zeroth\" numbering is philosophically loaded: it designates a structural placeholder we can never reach from within the system. Whenever articulated, it becomes Second Reality. Metaphysics expert: parallels Kant's unknowable thing-in-itself and Wittgenstein's \"what can be shown but not said.\" Buddhism expert: compares to Yogacara's *parinispanna* (consummate nature) but diverges because the author insists on in-principle inaccessibility. Kantian expert: mirrors Kant's *Grenzbegriff* (limiting concept). AVOID: \"non-reality\" or \"zero reality\" (suggests non-existence rather than inaccessibility). Capitalize \"Zeroth Reality.\"\n\n---\n\n## 实在 (shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the real\" (substantive)\n  - \"actuality\" (when emphasizing concrete existence)\n- **Note**: When used without numerical prefix, 实在 means \"reality\" in the ordinary sense, but the author's framework implies we must always ask: which reality? The three-fold schema (第〇/第一/第二实在) stratifies what counts as \"real\" according to epistemic access and constructive order. Buddhism expert: use \"Reality\" with capital R when part of the numbered system. AVOID: \"substance\" (Aristotelian baggage) or \"being\" (conflates with 存在).\n\n---\n\n## 清醒的梦境 (qingxing de mengjing)\n\n- **Main translation**: the lucid dreamscape\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the self-aware dreamscape\"\n  - \"the reflective dreamscape\"\n- **Note**: The author's term for post-metaphysical, poetic existence: being in a dreamscape while knowing you're in one, yet still fully investing. \"清醒\" (lucid/awake/clear-headed) indicates self-awareness. The author explicitly invokes \"lucid dreaming\" as the metaphor. This is the stance enabled by recognizing the disenchantment of Zeroth Reality. Buddhism expert: parallels Chan awakening's third stage -- \"after enlightenment, mountains are mountains again.\" All experts agree \"lucid dreamscape\" perfectly captures the concept.\n\n---\n\n## 沉醉的梦境 (chenzui de mengjing)\n\n- **Main translation**: the intoxicated dreamscape\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the unreflective dreamscape\"\n  - \"the absorbed dreamscape\"\n- **Note**: Pre-metaphysical existence: being in a dreamscape without knowing you're in one. The author identifies this with belief/faith where purpose appears as logically groundless. Existentialism expert: corresponds to Sartre's *mauvaise foi* but the author is more generous -- intoxication is not moral failing but the natural pre-nihilistic stance.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Phenomenology recommends \"absorbed\" over \"intoxicated\" (more neutral, less pejorative). Chinese Philosophy recommends \"immersed\" or \"intoxicated.\" Buddhism recommends \"intoxicated\" (preserves Buddhist resonance of *mada*, clouded awareness). Existentialism recommends \"intoxicated\" but notes \"immersed\" is acceptable. **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"intoxicated\" as main translation to preserve the author's 沉醉 metaphor (sink-drunk). Note in translator's introduction that this is descriptive, not pejorative.\n\n---\n\n## 清醒 (qingxing)\n\n- **Main translation**: lucid\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"awake\" (acceptable, especially in \"awake within the dream\")\n  - \"wakeful\" (Buddhism)\n  - \"clear-minded\" / \"clear-sighted\"\n- **Note**: All experts converge on \"lucid\" as the best translation. Describes the mode of inhabiting a dreamscape while aware it is constructed. Buddhism expert: carries overtones of Buddhist *bodhi* (awakening) but is epistemological rather than soteriological. Phenomenology expert: parallels Husserl's phenomenological attitude. AVOID: \"awakened\" (too specifically Buddhist); \"conscious\" (too Cartesian/neutral).\n\n---\n\n## 沉醉 (chenzui)\n\n- **Main translation**: intoxicated\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"absorbed\" (Phenomenology)\n  - \"immersed\" (when intoxication metaphor is too strong)\n  - \"entranced\" (poetic contexts)\n- **Note**: Full absorption in a dreamscape without meta-awareness of its constructed nature. Literally \"sink-drunk.\" Buddhism expert: recalls Buddhist warnings against *madya* (intoxicants) that cloud discernment. Existentialism expert: maps onto Heidegger's *das Man* -- not culpable but structural.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Same as 沉醉的梦境 above. Phenomenology recommends \"absorbed\" (neutral); Buddhism/Existentialism/Chinese Philosophy/Metaphysics recommend \"intoxicated\" (faithful to metaphor). **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"intoxicated\" as default; \"absorbed\" when context demands neutrality.\n\n---\n\n## 联想 (lianxiang)\n\n- **Main translation**: association\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"associative connection\" (when emphasizing relational character)\n  - \"cognitive morphism\" (Philosophy of Mind, technical)\n  - \"associative morphism\" (Phenomenology, technical)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on \"association\" as the main translation. In the categorical framework, associations are the morphisms (arrows) connecting experiences within E. Crucially, associations are themselves experiences (感受), which is why E has tower structure. Phenomenology expert: carries the weight of Husserl's passive synthesis through association (*Assoziation*). Philosophy of Mind expert: adds composability -- if A associates to B and B to C, there is a determinate A-to-C association. Metaphysics expert: echoes Hume's \"association of ideas\" but is more structural. Chinese Philosophy expert warns that 联想 also means \"imagination\" in Chinese -- not the intended sense.\n\n---\n\n## 超越 (chaoyue)\n\n- **Main translation**: transcendence (noun) / to transcend (verb)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"going-beyond\" (verbal, less technical)\n  - \"surpass\" (when emphasizing exceeding limits)\n- **Note**: The author uses this in multiple senses: (1) the traditional metaphysical quest for Zeroth Reality (a failed attempt at transcendence); (2) what lies outside the current boundary of thought; (3) immanent self-transformation through practice. True transcendence (reaching Zeroth Reality) is impossible, but dynamic transcendence (evolution of one's experiential sphere) is real. Kantian expert: author's usage is closer to Heidegger's *Uberstieg* than to Kant's transcendental method. AVOID: \"transcendental\" (Kantian term of art) unless specifically discussing Kant.\n\n---\n\n## 超越性 (chaoyuexing)\n\n- **Main translation**: transcendence (as quality/property) / transcendent character\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the transcendent\" (substantive)\n  - \"outward-reaching dimension\" (Existentialism)\n- **Note**: The nominal form, referring to the quality of transcending. Key usage: \"one's own death is transcendent for oneself\" -- death is beyond the boundary of one's experiential sphere. Existentialism expert: sharp critique of Heidegger's *Sein-zum-Tode* -- the death one \"lives toward\" is always one's metaphysical conception of death, not death itself.\n\n---\n\n## 虚无 (xuwu)\n\n- **Main translation**: nothingness / the void\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"nihility\" (formal philosophical contexts)\n  - \"emptiness-as-absence\" (Buddhism, when distinguishing from 空)\n  - AVOID: \"emptiness\" (reserve for Buddhist 空/sunyata)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on the critical distinction from Buddhist 空 (emptiness/sunyata). The author's 虚无 is the void left when the highest values (ultimate reality) collapse -- not a positive entity but an absence. \"Nihilism is not a something, a doctrine, but a nothing, a void.\" Chinese Philosophy expert: 虚 (empty, void) + 无 (nothing) -- simultaneously negative and cosmologically resonant (the Daoist productive void). Existentialism expert: 虚 (without real significance) + 妄 (arrogant, self-deceptive) per the author's own etymological note. Buddhism expert: this IS the nihilistic extreme (*ucchedavada*) that Madhyamaka warns against, but the author does not remain here. NEVER translate 虚无 as \"emptiness\" (which should be reserved for 空).\n\n---\n\n## 虚无主义 (xuwu zhuyi)\n\n- **Main translation**: nihilism\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the condition of nihility\" (when emphasizing state rather than doctrine)\n- **Note**: Standard translation. The author understands nihilism not as a doctrine but as a condition of meaning-loss: \"Nihilism is not produced or created, just as void is not produced or created, but rather because nothing was produced or created -- nothing is here.\" Existentialism expert: arrives through structural rather than historical analysis (contrast Nietzsche). The author's entire project is framed as what comes after nihilism.\n\n---\n\n## 后形而上学 (hou xing er shang xue)\n\n- **Main translation**: post-metaphysics\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"post-metaphysical thinking\" (echoing Habermas)\n- **Note**: All experts agree. Not \"after and done with\" metaphysics but \"after and transformed.\" The author defines it as metaphysics that: (1) takes phenomena as center, (2) acknowledges all 形而上 as constructions upon phenomena, (3) acknowledges non-rationality, (4) centers on practice (实践) as the overlap of ideal and phenomenon. Kantian expert: parallels Kant's limitation of metaphysics but goes further -- accepts non-rationality at the foundation. AVOID: \"postmetaphysics\" (one word) which might suggest a total break rather than transformation.\n\n---\n\n## 前形而上学 (qian xing er shang xue)\n\n- **Main translation**: pre-metaphysics\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"traditional metaphysics\" (the author's own gloss)\n  - \"classical metaphysics\"\n  - \"pre-nihilist metaphysics\" (Chinese Philosophy expert)\n- **Note**: The author's term for the entire Western and Chinese metaphysical traditions before nihilism -- from Thales through Hegel, from the *Yijing* through Neo-Confucianism. The defining feature is pursuit of ultimate reality without awareness that this pursuit is non-rational. The \"pre\" is relative to nihilism, not chronologically primitive.\n\n---\n\n## 存在 (cunzai)\n\n- **Main translation**: existence / being / to exist\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Being\" (capitalized, when discussing ontology or translating Heidegger's *Sein*)\n  - \"existence\" (when asking whether something exists)\n  - \"presence\" (Phenomenology, when emphasizing being-present)\n- **Note**: Context-dependent. The author's framework is cautious about ontology. Existence is tied to presence in phenomena: something exists (for us) insofar as it appears in First Reality or is well-grounded in Second Reality. Existentialism expert: the author shifts from the question of Being to the structure of experiential fields. Phenomenology expert: when the author says phenomena \"存在,\" this is better translated as \"are present/given\" than \"exist\" in a metaphysical sense. Do NOT assume this maps cleanly onto Heidegger's *Sein/Seiende* distinction.\n\n---\n\n## 道 (dao)\n\n- **Main translation**: Dao (transliterated)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the Way\" (traditional rendering, acceptable with contextualization)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on transliteration. The author uses 道 primarily in the 道德仁义礼 sequence analysis, showing it is GENERATED last through progressive generalization from phenomena, not given first as the primordial source. Chinese Philosophy expert: \"genuinely original -- no classical Chinese philosopher has argued that 道 itself is a cognitive construction built from phenomenal observation upward.\" Buddhism expert: parallels *dharma-kaya* or *tathata* but the author emphasizes inaccessibility through articulation. In the category-theoretic framework, 道 appears at different meta-orders depending on whether the construction is top-down or bottom-up. AVOID over-committing to any particular Daoist interpretation.\n\n---\n\n## 德 (de)\n\n- **Main translation**: De (transliterated in philosophical passages); \"inherent character\" (when English gloss needed)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"virtue\" (Confucian moral contexts only)\n  - \"power\" / \"potency\" / \"efficacy\" (Daoist contexts)\n  - \"nature\" (in 人德 = human nature)\n- **Note**: Notoriously difficult. The author analyzes 德 as \"what makes a thing what it is\" (使得人而成为人的东西) -- the collection of properties we inductively generalize and then normatively impose as definitional. Chinese Philosophy expert: \"DANGER: 'Virtue' imports moral connotations the author strips away (德 applies to all things, not just moral agents). 'Essence' imports Western metaphysical baggage.\" Buddhism expert: parallels Buddhist *svabhava* (self-nature) but is relational/functional, not essential.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Metaphysics recommends \"virtue (Confucian) / power (Daoist) / de (transliterated).\" Chinese Philosophy recommends \"De (romanized) or inherent character.\" Buddhism recommends \"virtue (moral) / potency or efficacy (Daoist).\" **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"De\" (transliterated) in philosophical passages about the 道德仁义礼 sequence. Use \"virtue\" only in explicitly Confucian moral contexts. Use \"efficacy\" or \"potency\" in Daoist cosmological contexts. Always include a translator's note on the semantic range.\n\n---\n\n## 本质 (benzhi)\n\n- **Main translation**: essence / essential nature\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"nature\" (less technical)\n  - \"whatness\" (technical, echoing scholastic *quidditas*)\n- **Note**: In the author's post-metaphysical framework, \"essence\" is reinterpreted: not a hidden inner nature but the universal property of a stable subcategory in E. The author replaces intrinsic essence with structural position: \"what is Theseus's ship? It is that experience which you associate with any part of the ship.\" Metaphysics expert: danger of readers importing Aristotelian *ousia*. Standard translation works if the translator tracks the relocation from substance to structure.\n\n---\n\n## 构造 (gouzao)\n\n- **Main translation**: construction / to construct\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"constitution\" (Phenomenology, for Husserl's *Konstitution*)\n  - \"structuration\" (when emphasizing process)\n  - \"synthesis\" (Kantian, when parallel is explicit)\n- **Note**: The author distinguishes description from construction. E (境) is descriptive of P (phenomena), not constructive. However, within the category-theoretic framework, \"构造\" is a specific technical notion: a tower-structure built from base objects (基石). All experts agree on \"construction\" as default; Phenomenology expert recommends \"constitution\" for phenomenological contexts where Husserl's *Konstitution* is paralleled. Kantian expert: parallels Kant's synthesis but is more dynamic and revisable.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Phenomenology recommends \"constitution\" as main translation (to align with Husserl). All others recommend \"construction.\" **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"construction\" as default; \"constitution\" only when explicitly discussing Husserlian parallels. Note: the author's usage is broader than either Husserl's or Kant's.\n\n---\n\n## 实践 (shijian)\n\n- **Main translation**: practice / praxis\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"practical engagement\"\n  - \"praxis\" (Marxist/Aristotelian contexts)\n- **Note**: Core of the author's post-metaphysics. Defined as \"the overlap of ideal and phenomenon\" (理想和现象之重叠). Practice is where metaphysical constructs (Second Reality) and phenomena (First Reality) come together -- where we act in the world guided by concepts. Kantian expert: not Kant's \"practical reason\" (moral/volitional) but closer to pragmatist or Marxist praxis. The author: \"we are creators, poets of our own lives and feelings\" through practice.\n\n---\n\n## 我 (wo)\n\n- **Main translation**: I / self\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the self\" (when discussing the concept philosophically)\n  - \"the I\" (when analyzing 我 as philosophical object)\n  - AVOID: \"ego\" (unless explicitly discussing Husserl's transcendental ego or Freud)\n- **Note**: The author provides a category-theoretic definition: \"'I' is that feeling, the feeling that whenever you mention any aspect related to me, it causes me to associate.\" Formally, \"I\" is the universal property (terminal object) of a subcategory of E containing all experiences related to me. This provides a structural, non-substantialist account of self. Philosophy of Mind expert: aligns with Buddhist Abhidharma analysis (self as conventional designation), Hume's bundle theory, and narrative self theories. Buddhism expert: \"remarkable convergence\" -- the definition IS the Middle Way on self (not eternalism, not nihilism). Chinese Philosophy expert: resonates with Buddhist 无我 (no-self) but approached phenomenologically.\n\n---\n\n## 自我 (ziwo)\n\n- **Main translation**: self (reflexive/philosophical)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"ego\" (only in explicit psychoanalytic contexts)\n  - \"oneself\" (reflexive usage)\n- **Note**: Distinguished from 我 by being reflexive/objectified. While 我 is the first-person subject, 自我 is the self as object of reflection or concern. Philosophy of Mind expert: 自我 emerges at T_1 or higher in the tower structure -- it is the experience of oneself as object of reflection. The author discusses self-transformation: \"based on the present self, through practice, transcend the present self and construct a new self.\"\n\n---\n\n## 自我实现 (ziwo shixian)\n\n- **Main translation**: self-realization\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"self-actualization\" (AVOID -- too Maslow-specific)\n- **Note**: The author glosses: \"making the self become actual/real\" (使得自我得以成为现实). Tied to practice and the overlap of ideal and phenomenon: \"we see ourselves in phenomena, confirm my existence, make phenomena become 'part of me.'\" Echoes Hegel's *Selbstverwirklichung* and Marxist self-realization through labor. \"Self-realization\" captures the making-real better than \"self-actualization.\"\n\n---\n\n## 意义 (yiyi)\n\n- **Main translation**: meaning / significance\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"significance\" (when emphasizing weight)\n  - \"sense\" (when emphasizing intelligibility)\n  - \"purpose\" (when teleological dimension is primary)\n- **Note**: Central to the author's argument: meaning and feeling are \"two sides of one body\" (两面一体). Meaning IS felt experience. The author: \"I boldly surmise that meaning and purpose are in fact the surging of sensibility, the crystallization of experience.\" The attempt to seek meaning externally (向外寻求意义) is the category error that generates absurdity. Existentialism expert: connects to Heidegger's *Befindlichkeit* but is more radical -- meaning cannot be separated from affect.\n\n---\n\n## 理解 (lijie)\n\n- **Main translation**: understanding / to understand\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"comprehension\"\n- **Note**: The author formalizes understanding as a natural transformation between two functorial evolutions: the evolution of a structure and the evolution of one's experience. You understand something when these align coherently. Philosophy of Mind expert: \"revolutionary account\" -- understanding is not correspondence between mind and world but alignment between internal simulation and external structure. Epistemology expert: dissolves the understanding/explanation distinction. Broader than 掌握 (mastery) -- there is a gradient.\n\n---\n\n## 掌握 (zhangwo)\n\n- **Main translation**: mastery / to grasp\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"command\" (emphasizing full competence)\n  - \"complete understanding\"\n- **Note**: Technical term in the natural transformation analysis. To \"grasp\" a formula means the natural transformation component is the identity morphism -- no gap between your derivation and the truth. Epistemology expert: \"a phenomenological notion of knowledge.\" Philosophy of Mind expert: explains why some correct computations don't feel like mastery and why mastery persists across contexts.\n\n---\n\n## 知识 (zhishi)\n\n- **Main translation**: knowledge\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"belief taken to be correct\" (when emphasizing author's deflationary analysis)\n- **Note**: Epistemology expert: the author radically redefines knowledge by collapsing the JTB (Justified True Belief) tripartite analysis. Through the \"access argument,\" truth and justification both reduce to belief in practice. More radical than post-Gettier externalism -- dissolves the knowledge/belief distinction entirely at the practical level.\n\n---\n\n## 信念 (xinnian)\n\n- **Main translation**: belief\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"doxastic state\" (technical epistemological contexts)\n  - \"conviction\" (when emphasizing strength)\n- **Note**: Central to the author's dissolution of JTB. Defined as \"a thought of taking something as true,\" inherently subjective. The author argues all justification reduces to belief (belief-about-belief). Epistemology expert: the Chinese 信念 carries stronger connotations of conviction than English \"belief.\"\n\n---\n\n## 真理 (zhenli)\n\n- **Main translation**: truth\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"objective truth\" (when distinguishing from subjective belief)\n- **Note**: The author's treatment is deflationary and access-focused. \"Truth\" in JTB refers to objective truth, but the author argues this is \"methodologically impossible\" to access. Not anti-realism (no ontological claim) but truth is \"inoperative\" in knowledge formation.\n\n---\n\n## 辩护 / 证成\n\n- **Main translation**: justification\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"warrant\" (emphasizing epistemic entitlement)\n  - \"verification relation\" (in categorical framework)\n- **Note**: Epistemology expert: the author's central thesis is that justification reduces to belief. All justification bases collapse into belief when we ask how we access them. In the K1 framework, verification relations are morphisms in the knowledge category.\n\n---\n\n## 理性 (lixing)\n\n- **Main translation**: reason / rationality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the rational\" (as substantive, contrasted with non-rational)\n  - \"rational faculty\" (when emphasizing Kant's *Vernunft*)\n- **Note**: The author argues reason is a *tool* (工具) whose purposes are non-rational. Kantian expert: this deflates reason from its Kantian status as source of necessary structures and regulative ideals. Epistemology expert: rational justification cannot justify itself without circularity, so rationality's value is non-rationally grounded.\n\n---\n\n## 先验 (xianyan)\n\n- **Main translation**: a priori / transcendental (context-dependent)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"a priori\" (knowledge independent of experience)\n  - \"transcendental\" (conditions of possibility of experience)\n- **Note**: The author's treatment is carefully agnostic. Stable structures S_E preserved under evolution *might* include a priori elements if identified at the earliest cognitive stage. But this is *descriptive*, not transcendental deduction. Kantian expert: \"the form of synthetic a priori knowledge, but the content left to empirical investigation.\" Epistemology expert: naturalizes the a priori.\n\n---\n\n## 综合 (zonghe)\n\n- **Main translation**: synthesis / synthetic\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"integration\" (emphasizing unification)\n- **Note**: Used in contexts about how elements are combined to form higher-level structures. Kantian expert: the author extends Kant's synthetic a priori from mathematics to the domain of meaning. The framework suggests all knowledge is synthetic (constructed from experiential materials).\n\n---\n\n## 体验 (tiyan)\n\n- **Main translation**: lived experience\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"experience\" (when context is clear)\n  - \"Erlebnis\" (scholarly, Husserlian)\n  - \"experiential content\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n- **Note**: Often used interchangeably with 感受, but 体验 tends to emphasize the more integrated, meaning-laden, durational dimension of experience. Closest to Husserl's *Erlebnis*. Kantian expert: closer to Husserl's *Erlebnis* or Dilthey's *Erleben*. Chinese Philosophy expert: emphasizes the \"living-through\" quality.\n\n---\n\n## 经验 (jingyan)\n\n- **Main translation**: experience\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"empirical experience\" (to distinguish from 体验)\n  - \"Erfahrung\" (scholarly, contrasting with *Erlebnis*)\n- **Note**: Carries connotation of accumulated, reflected-upon, empirical experience -- closer to Husserl's *Erfahrung* as opposed to *Erlebnis* (体验). Kantian expert: Kant's *Erfahrung* -- structured, unified cognition of phenomena. Philosophy of Mind expert: marks the boundary between a priori and empirical.\n\n---\n\n## 意识 (yishi)\n\n- **Main translation**: consciousness\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"awareness\" (when emphasizing attentional aspect)\n- **Note**: Philosophy of Mind expert: in the framework, consciousness is the phenomenal field P from which 境 structures are constructed. This aligns with phenomenal consciousness (what-it's-like-ness). Phenomenology expert: when the author discusses 清醒 (lucid), this relates to reflective consciousness.\n\n---\n\n## 认知 (renzhi)\n\n- **Main translation**: cognition / cognitive structure\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"epistemic structure\" (when knowledge-focused)\n- **Note**: The framework distinguishes consciousness (意识, phenomenal field P) from cognition (认知, the category-theoretic structure 境 built upon P). Philosophy of Mind expert: aligns with embodied cognition and enactivism.\n\n---\n\n## 范畴 (fanchou)\n\n- **Main translation**: category\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"范畴论\" = \"category theory\" (the mathematical discipline)\n- **Note**: Dual usage: (1) Kantian categories (pure concepts of understanding), (2) mathematical category theory (objects and morphisms). The author primarily uses sense (2) but the philosophical overlap with sense (1) is intentional. Kantian expert: the author replaces Kant's table of categories with category-theoretic structures -- universal properties replace categories, functors replace schematism, natural transformations replace synthetic unity of apperception.\n\n---\n\n## 泛性质 / 范性质 (fan xingzhi)\n\n- **Main translation**: universal property\n- **Alternatives**: None (standard mathematical terminology)\n- **Note**: From category theory. An object with universal property is characterized by its relationships to all other objects. The author uses this philosophically: universal properties in subcategories of E correspond to what we experience as \"essences\" -- this relocates essence from intrinsic nature to categorical position, from substance to structure. Kantian expert: formalizes what Kant called the \"schema\" of a concept.\n\n---\n\n## 塔式结构 (ta shi jiegou)\n\n- **Main translation**: tower structure\n- **Alternatives**: None needed\n- **Note**: A category where morphisms are also objects, creating ascending levels. E has tower structure because associations (morphisms) are themselves experiences (objects). Formalized as T_0 -> T_1 -> T_2 -> ... -> T_infinity. Philosophy of Mind expert: provides formal model for meta-cognition and higher-order thought. Kantian expert: related to Fichte's reflexive self-positing.\n\n---\n\n## 基石 (jishi)\n\n- **Main translation**: base stone / foundation stone\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"base object\" (more technical)\n  - \"starting point\"\n- **Note**: In the tower-structure construction, base stones are objects designated as foundational. Choosing different base stones gives different \"constructions\" and thus different \"metaphysics.\" The metaphor of \"stone\" suggests solidity/foundation.\n\n---\n\n## 元阶 (yuan jie)\n\n- **Main translation**: meta-order\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"order\" (when clear from context)\n- **Note**: Technical term from the tower-structure construction. An object's \"absolute meta-order\" is which level it first appears; \"relative meta-order\" is defined relative to a chosen base stone. The 道德仁义礼 examples show how the same subcategory can be assigned different meta-orders depending on construction direction.\n\n---\n\n## 态射 / 箭头 (taishe / jiantou)\n\n- **Main translation**: morphism / arrow\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"mapping\" (less technical)\n- **Note**: Standard category theory terms. In the framework, morphisms are associations (联想) between experiences. Philosophy of Mind expert: \"morphisms are as ontologically basic as mental contents.\" The arrows-only formulation collapses the distinction between objects and morphisms at the fundamental level.\n\n---\n\n## 函子 (hanzi)\n\n- **Main translation**: functor\n- **Alternatives**: None (technical term)\n- **Note**: Structure-preserving map between categories. Key applications: evolution functor T: E_t -> E_{t+1} (cognitive development/change); inclusion functors (embedding subcategories); translation functors (mapping between domains). Kantian expert: \"the author's major methodological innovation beyond Kant -- Kant's framework is static; the author introduces dynamics via functors.\"\n\n---\n\n## 自然变换 (ziran bianhua)\n\n- **Main translation**: natural transformation\n- **Alternatives**: None (technical term)\n- **Note**: The author's formalization of understanding (理解). A natural transformation between the evolution of formal structures and the evolution of experience is the condition of understanding. When the component is the identity morphism, this is mastery (掌握). Kantian expert: \"formalizes the schematism and extends it to meaning, aesthetics, and all understanding.\" Philosophy of Mind expert: \"meaning is neither in text/world nor in mind, but in the natural transformation between them.\"\n\n---\n\n## 稳定结构 (wending jiegou)\n\n- **Main translation**: stable structure\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"invariant structure\" (mathematical contexts)\n  - \"structural invariant\"\n- **Note**: The structure S_E preserved under the evolution functor T. Formal counterpart to constancy (恒常). The author conjectures: there exists S_E such that T(S_E) is isomorphic to S_E. Kantian expert: corresponds to Kant's forms of intuition and categories but discovered empirically rather than deduced a priori.\n\n---\n\n## 稳定子范畴 (wending zi fanchou)\n\n- **Main translation**: stable subcategory\n- **Alternatives**: None\n- **Note**: The author conjectures that universal properties in stable subcategories of E correspond to what we experience as \"essences.\" Part of the formal apparatus that \"runs ahead of its interpretation.\"\n\n---\n\n## 认知结构 (renzhi jiegou)\n\n- **Main translation**: cognitive structure\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"epistemic structure\"\n- **Note**: Kantian expert: if part of the stable structure is shown to be necessary for constructing any E from P, it may be called \"cognitive structure\" -- this is a transcendental argument formalized categorically.\n\n---\n\n## The 道德仁义礼 Sequence\n\n### 仁 (ren)\n\n- **Main translation**: humaneness\n- **Alternatives**: \"benevolence,\" \"fellow-feeling,\" \"Ren\" (transliterated)\n- **Note**: Chinese Philosophy expert recommends \"humaneness\" or \"fellow-feeling\" over \"benevolence\" (too external/active). The author distinguishes 现象仁 (the inner feeling of care) from the theoretical concept. \"Humaneness\" captures the experiential, empathetic dimension.\n\n### 义 (yi)\n\n- **Main translation**: rightness\n- **Alternatives**: \"moral impetus,\" \"sense of obligation\" (author's specific usage), \"Yi\" (transliterated)\n- **Note**: Chinese Philosophy expert: the author treats 义 as the motivational bridge between inner feeling (仁) and outward action (礼) -- \"推动力\" (motivation). \"Righteousness\" is too moralistic.\n\n### 礼 (li)\n\n- **Main translation**: ritual conduct\n- **Alternatives**: \"ritual,\" \"propriety,\" \"patterned behavior\" (when phenomenal immediacy stressed)\n- **Note**: Chinese Philosophy expert: the author distinguishes 现象礼 (observable behavioral patterns) from theoretical/normative 礼. \"Ritual\" in English risks suggesting empty ceremony; \"ritual conduct\" emphasizes behavioral dimension.\n\n### 现象礼 / 现象仁 / 现象义\n\n- **Main translation**: phenomenal ritual / phenomenal humaneness / phenomenal rightness\n- **Alternatives**: \"observable ritual conduct,\" \"felt fellow-feeling,\" \"felt obligation\"\n- **Note**: The author's coinages distinguishing the original experiential basis from the metaphysical constructs. \"现象X\" = \"X as it appears in phenomena before being theorized.\" Crucial to the reversal argument.\n\n---\n\n## 祛魅 (qumei)\n\n- **Main translation**: disenchantment\n- **Alternatives**: None (standard translation of Weber's *Entzauberung*)\n- **Note**: What happens to Zeroth Reality in post-metaphysics: we recognize its \"special status\" was conferred by non-rational impulse, not by actual accessibility. Disenchantment is clarification, not loss.\n\n---\n\n## 终极实在 (zhongji shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: ultimate reality\n- **Alternatives**: \"absolute reality,\" \"fundamental reality\"\n- **Note**: What traditional metaphysics seeks -- technically designated as Zeroth Reality. The author shows this is structurally unreachable. Standard translation.\n\n---\n\n## 客观世界 (keguan shijie)\n\n- **Main translation**: objective world\n- **Alternatives**: \"external world\"\n- **Note**: Key move: \"the objective world is a model (模型) based on phenomena.\" Not metaphysical realism but constructive empiricism. Must be accompanied by notes explaining it is a constructed model (Second Reality).\n\n---\n\n## 同一 (tongyi)\n\n- **Main translation**: identity / sameness\n- **Alternatives**: None needed\n- **Note**: Connected to constancy. \"Causality is just temporal identity.\" Recognizing something as the same across time or context. Standard philosophical translation.\n\n---\n\n## 因果 (yinguo)\n\n- **Main translation**: causality / cause and effect\n- **Alternatives**: None needed\n- **Note**: The author's claim: \"causality is just temporal identity\" -- recognizing causal connections is recognizing constancy across time. Standard translation.\n\n---\n\n## 属性 (shuxing)\n\n- **Main translation**: property / attribute\n- **Alternatives**: \"characteristic\" (less technical)\n- **Note**: Used in the crucial move from property (属性) to definition (定义): what begins as contingent attribute becomes necessary essence. Standard translation.\n\n---\n\n## 定义 (dingyi)\n\n- **Main translation**: definition\n- **Alternatives**: \"to define\" (verbal)\n- **Note**: The transformation from 属性 (property) to 定义 (definition) is central to the author's constructivist account. From \"things CAN have X\" to \"things MUST have X to count as X.\"\n\n---\n\n## 死亡 (siwang)\n\n- **Main translation**: death\n- **Alternatives**: None\n- **Note**: Existentialism expert: philosophically crucial. The author argues death is transcendent (超越性) to oneself, making Heidegger's \"Being-toward-death\" impossible as articulated. \"We cannot actively care about the purpose of life; we can only care about the process of life.\"\n\n---\n\n## 荒谬 (huangmiu)\n\n- **Main translation**: absurdity / the absurd\n- **Alternatives**: \"absurdism\" (the philosophical position)\n- **Note**: Existentialism expert: the author dissolves Camus's absurdity through the cat-raising example, arguing absurdity is an artifact of misdirected intentionality (seeking meaning externally). When meaning is internally generated, absurdity vanishes.\n\n---\n\n## 异化 (yihua)\n\n- **Main translation**: alienation\n- **Alternatives**: \"estrangement,\" \"reification\"\n- **Note**: Existentialism expert: the author reinterprets Camus's absurdity through Marx's concept of alienation. \"When the source of meaning is externalized, the off-tone appears.\"\n\n---\n\n## 反叛 (fanpan)\n\n- **Main translation**: revolt / rebellion\n- **Alternatives**: \"defiance\"\n- **Note**: References Camus's *revolte*. The author reinterprets: revolt is itself internally generated meaning, effective but \"unnecessarily dramatic.\" The cat-raiser has gone beyond revolt.\n\n---\n\n## 自由 (ziyou)\n\n- **Main translation**: freedom\n- **Alternatives**: \"liberty\" (political contexts)\n- **Note**: Existentialism expert: relates to capacity to construct and choose among dreamscapes, but not absolute -- some dreamscapes are unavoidable. Freedom is practical and processual.\n\n---\n\n## 选择 (xuanze)\n\n- **Main translation**: choice\n- **Alternatives**: \"decision\"\n- **Note**: Choice is embedded in practical activity of Jing-construction and navigation. The coin-flip example: choice as self-discovery through constructed decision-mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n## 主体间性 (zhuti jianxing)\n\n- **Main translation**: intersubjectivity\n- **Alternatives**: None (technical term)\n- **Note**: Mentioned briefly as a \"solved problem\" but not developed in detail. Standard philosophical terminology.\n\n---\n\n## 意向性 (yixiangxing)\n\n- **Main translation**: intentionality\n- **Alternatives**: None\n- **Note**: Husserl's *Intentionalitat*. Phenomenology expert: structurally encoded in the E-framework -- the tower structure captures the iterability of intentional acts. Not used frequently in the text but conceptually fundamental.\n\n---\n\n## 重整化 (chongzhenghua)\n\n- **Main translation**: renormalization\n- **Alternatives**: None (borrowed from physics)\n- **Note**: The author uses this to describe how macro-level phenomena emerge from micro-level phenomena. Metaphorical, describing phenomenological founding relations.\n\n---\n\n## 篮子 (lanzi)\n\n- **Main translation**: basket (metaphor for cognitive accessibility)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"accessible domain\" (functional)\n  - \"cognitive scope\" (abstract)\n  - \"horizon of thinkability\" (phenomenological)\n- **Note**: Philosophy of Mind expert: crucial metaphor for cognitive closure and thought's boundary. We can only think about what is in the basket. Engages with Colin McGinn's cognitive closure thesis.\n\n---\n\n## 自上而下 / 自下而上\n\n- **Main translation**: top-down / bottom-up\n- **Alternatives**: None needed\n- **Note**: Standard translations. Construction methods for the 道德仁义礼 hierarchy. The reversal between these two directions is central to the author's argument.\n\n---\n\n## 承认 (chengren)\n\n- **Main translation**: acknowledge / recognize\n- **Alternatives**: \"admit\" (when emphasizing acceptance of difficult truth)\n- **Note**: Buddhism expert: pivotal term. The author insists non-rationality \"should be acknowledged\" -- this is the pivot from nihilism to the poetic. Parallels Buddhist *yatha-bhuta* (seeing as it really is) but with different endpoint: lucid engagement rather than liberation.\n\n---\n\n## 空 (kong)\n\n- **Main translation**: emptiness (Buddhist, *sunyata*)\n- **Alternatives**: \"void,\" \"vacuity\"\n- **Note**: Buddhism expert: CRITICAL -- do NOT conflate with 虚无 (nihilistic void). Buddhist emptiness means absence of *svabhava* (inherent existence), not absence of phenomena. The author rarely uses 空 in technical Buddhist sense. When it appears, maintain strict distinction from 虚无.\n\n---\n\n## 无常 (wuchang)\n\n- **Main translation**: impermanence\n- **Alternatives**: \"impermanent\" (adjectival), \"transience\"\n- **Note**: Buddhist technical term (*anitya*). The author focuses on 恒常 (constancy) as the metaphysical drive rather than asserting impermanence. Buddhism expert: notable absence -- the author approaches from the phenomenology of our pursuit of stability.\n\n---\n\n## 缘起 (yuanqi)\n\n- **Main translation**: dependent origination\n- **Alternatives**: \"conditioned arising,\" \"interdependent co-arising\"\n- **Note**: Buddhism expert: though the term rarely appears explicitly, the author's core move embodies it. Objects are defined by morphisms (relations), not intrinsic content -- this is formal expression of *pratityasamutpada*. The tower structure resonates with Hua-yen's *shishi wuai* (interpenetration).\n\n---\n\n## 自性 (zixing)\n\n- **Main translation**: self-nature / inherent existence\n- **Alternatives**: \"intrinsic nature,\" \"*svabhava*\" (transliterated)\n- **Note**: Buddhism expert: Madhyamaka's target. The author rejects internal essences in favor of relational definition, recapitulating the Buddhist rejection of *svabhava* without using the term.\n\n---\n\n## 无我 (wuwo)\n\n- **Main translation**: non-self\n- **Alternatives**: \"no-self,\" \"selflessness\" (ethical), \"*anatman*\" (transliterated)\n- **Note**: Buddhism expert: core Buddhist doctrine. The author rarely uses this term explicitly but the category-theoretic definition of 我 (as universal property, not substance) functionally embodies the *anatman* teaching.\n\n---\n\n## P / E (Formal Symbols)\n\n- **Main translation**: P / E (retain letters)\n- **Gloss**: P = \"the phenomenal field\" or \"the totality of phenomena\"; E = \"Jing\" or \"the structured experiential field\"\n- **Note**: Retain in translation. P stands for Phenomenon, Physical World, Physics. E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, Experience. Full totality written in Fraktur (blackletter) script. Retain all formal notation.\n\n---\n\n## Additional Minor Terms\n\n### 天 (tian)\n- **Main translation**: Heaven (cosmological) / Nature (in compounds)\n- **Note**: Rarely used as technical term by the author. Standard in citations of classical philosophy.\n\n### 理 (li)\n- **Main translation**: principle (Neo-Confucian) / pattern\n- **Note**: Not deeply engaged by the author. Standard when it appears in citations.\n\n### 气 (qi)\n- **Main translation**: Qi (romanized) / material force\n- **Note**: Not extensively engaged by the author.\n\n### 性 (xing)\n- **Main translation**: nature / inherent nature\n- **Note**: Related to author's 德 but traditional 性 is more essentialist. Appears in citations.\n\n### 意境 (yijing)\n- **Main translation**: artistic conception / realm of meaning\n- **Note**: Classical Chinese aesthetic term. Distinct from technical 境 (Jing). Used in traditional sense.\n\n### 觉 / 悟 (jue / wu)\n- **Main translation**: awakening (觉) / realization (悟)\n- **Note**: Buddhist terms. The author deliberately avoids these, using 清醒 (lucid) instead. Maintain distinction.\n\n---\n\n# Disagreements Summary\n\nThis section collects all terms where expert dictionaries proposed genuinely different main translations, for the author's review and resolution.\n\n---\n\n### 1. 感受 (ganshou)\n\n| Expert | Main Recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Metaphysics | feeling; experience; sensation |\n| Phenomenology | feeling |\n| Epistemology | feeling / felt experience |\n| Existentialism | feeling / felt experience |\n| Philosophy of Mind | lived experience / phenomenal experience |\n| Kantian | feeling / sensation |\n| Chinese Philosophy | felt experience / feeling |\n| Buddhism | feeling |\n\n**Tension**: \"Feeling\" is simpler and more accessible but may trivialize (suggesting emotion only). \"Lived experience\" / \"phenomenal experience\" are more precise philosophically but heavier and more academic. \"Felt experience\" is a middle ground.\n\n**Recommendation**: \"Feeling\" as default, \"felt experience\" when broader scope is needed.\n\n---\n\n### 2. 诗意 (shiyi)\n\n| Expert | Main Recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Metaphysics | the poetic |\n| Phenomenology | the poetic |\n| Existentialism | the poetic / poetic dwelling |\n| Philosophy of Mind | (not primary entry) |\n| Kantian | the poetic / poetic engagement |\n| Chinese Philosophy | the Poetic (capitalized) |\n| Buddhism | poeticality |\n\n**Tension**: \"The poetic\" is consensus, but Buddhism expert prefers \"poeticality\" as a noun form. Chinese Philosophy expert insists on capitalization to signal philosophical weight (like \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\").\n\n**Recommendation**: \"The poetic\" as standard; capitalize in glossary and introduction.\n\n---\n\n### 3. 沉醉 / 沉醉的梦境 (chenzui / chenzui de mengjing)\n\n| Expert | Main Recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Metaphysics | intoxicated |\n| Phenomenology | absorbed |\n| Existentialism | intoxicated |\n| Philosophy of Mind | immersion / absorbed engagement / intoxication |\n| Chinese Philosophy | immersed / intoxicated |\n| Buddhism | intoxicated |\n\n**Tension**: \"Intoxicated\" preserves the Chinese metaphor (沉 = sink, 醉 = drunk) and Buddhist resonance (mada, clouded awareness), but carries potentially pejorative English connotations. \"Absorbed\" is more neutral and closer to phenomenological usage (Heidegger's *Verfallen*) but loses the critique of clouded judgment.\n\n**Recommendation**: \"Intoxicated\" as default (faithful to source text); translator's note clarifying this is descriptive, not pejorative.\n\n---\n\n### 4. 境界 (jingjie)\n\n| Expert | Main Recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Metaphysics | boundary; horizon; limit |\n| Phenomenology | realm |\n| Epistemology | (not primary entry) |\n| Kantian | (not primary entry) |\n| Chinese Philosophy | realm / experiential realm |\n| Buddhism | bounds, horizon, domain-and-limit |\n\n**Tension**: \"Boundary/horizon\" emphasizes the limit-character (界); \"realm\" emphasizes the domain-character (境). The author uses both senses.\n\n**Recommendation**: Context-dependent. \"Boundary\" or \"horizon\" when discussing limits; \"realm\" when discussing the domain itself.\n\n---\n\n### 5. 构造 (gouzao)\n\n| Expert | Main Recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Metaphysics | construction |\n| Phenomenology | constitution |\n| Epistemology | construction |\n| Philosophy of Mind | construction / structuring |\n| Kantian | construction / constitute |\n| Chinese Philosophy | (not primary entry) |\n| Buddhism | (not primary entry) |\n\n**Tension**: Phenomenology expert prefers \"constitution\" to align with Husserl's *Konstitution*. All others prefer \"construction.\" The author's usage is broader than Husserl's specific sense.\n\n**Recommendation**: \"Construction\" as default; \"constitution\" only in explicitly Husserlian comparative passages.\n\n---\n\n### 6. 德 (de)\n\n| Expert | Main Recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Metaphysics | virtue / power / de (context-dependent) |\n| Chinese Philosophy | De (romanized) / inherent character |\n| Buddhism | virtue / potency or efficacy |\n\n**Tension**: The term has radically different meanings in Confucian (moral virtue), Daoist (natural potency/efficacy), and the author's (constructivist -- what we decide defines a thing) contexts. \"Virtue\" imports moral connotations inappropriate for the author's general usage. \"Inherent character\" captures the author's sense but loses tradition.\n\n**Recommendation**: \"De\" (transliterated) in philosophical passages; context-specific translations (virtue/efficacy) with translator's notes elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n### 7. 虚无 (xuwu)\n\n| Expert | Main Recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Metaphysics | nothingness; the void |\n| Phenomenology | nothingness |\n| Epistemology | nihility / the void |\n| Existentialism | the void / nothingness |\n| Chinese Philosophy | the void / nothingness |\n| Buddhism | the void / emptiness-as-absence |\n\n**Tension**: Minor. \"Nothingness\" vs. \"the void\" -- both are acceptable. Key consensus: NEVER use \"emptiness\" (reserved for Buddhist 空).\n\n**Recommendation**: Use \"nothingness\" or \"the void\" depending on context; both acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**End of Master Dictionary**\n\nThis document should be used as the authoritative reference for all translation decisions. Where disagreements remain unresolved, the author should make final determinations. All translators should maintain consistency with the choices recorded here.\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":16615,"cache_read_input_tokens":111937,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":16615},"output_tokens":25,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CXzrAGRybM8RM5mt8AGPX","type":"assistant","uuid":"6a2ad294-f1cc-4ea5-ac34-5f0abb492084","timestamp":"2026-02-10T18:24:24.081Z"}

Epistemology\n4. Existentialism\n5. Philosophy of Mind\n6. Kantian/Transcendental Philosophy\n7. Chinese Philosophy\n8. Buddhism (Madhyamaka/Yogacara/Chan-Zen)\n\n**Date:** 2026-02-10\n**Purpose:** This is the authoritative reference document for the English translation of the **Jing Ji** (境集) collection. It synthesizes recommendations from all eight expert perspectives into a single consensus dictionary, preserving expert agreement, flagging disagreements, and providing the translator with clear guidance for every key term. Terms are ordered by importance and frequency of use in the essays.\n\n**How to Use This Dictionary:**\n- Each entry shows the consensus translation (or best-judgment call where experts disagree).\n- The **DISAGREEMENT** line appears only when experts propose genuinely different main translations. Stylistic variations (e.g., capitalization) are noted under Alternatives, not flagged as disagreements.\n- Notes synthesize insights from all relevant experts. The goal is to give the translator maximum context in minimum space.\n- A Disagreements Summary at the end collects all disputed terms for the author's review.\n\n---\n\n## 境 (jing)\n\n- **Main translation**: Jing (romanized, as technical term)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"E\" (in formal/category-theoretic passages, as the author uses)\n  - \"experiential realm\" (discursive contexts)\n  - \"experiential field\" / \"experiential milieu\" (Phenomenology)\n  - \"scape\" / \"experiential scape\" (Buddhism)\n  - \"cognitive-scape\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"sphere\" (Metaphysics, in literary contexts)\n- **Note**: This is the single most important and most difficult term in the entire collection. All eight experts agree it resists single-word translation. The author defines it as a category-theoretic structure on phenomena (P): objects are selected experiences, morphisms are associations, and morphisms are also objects (tower structure). It evolves dynamically via functors. The term resonates with Buddhist visaya/gocara (object-domain of consciousness), Husserl's Lebenswelt, Heidegger's Welt, and the Chinese aesthetic tradition of 意境. The author considers alternative names: \"game, book, adventure, small world, small freedom.\" Six of eight experts recommend keeping \"Jing\" transliterated with an explanatory apparatus on first use; two suggest descriptive glosses (\"experiential field,\" \"scape\"). Do NOT collapse into traditional Buddhist 境界 (spiritual attainment) or aesthetic 意境 -- the author's usage is formally precise. Use \"Jing\" consistently, with \"E\" in mathematical/formal passages.\n\n---\n\n## 现象 (xianxiang)\n\n- **Main translation**: phenomena (plural) / phenomenon (singular)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the phenomenal\" (when used substantively for the field as a whole)\n  - \"phenomenal given\" (emphasizing givenness, Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"appearance\" (only with strong caveat -- see note)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on \"phenomena\" as main translation. The author uses this term with full phenomenological weight, closer to Husserl's Phanomen than to Kant's Erscheinung. Phenomena are NOT \"mere appearances\" behind which a truer reality hides; they are the indubitable ground of all experience, identified with \"all feelings taken together.\" Phenomena = First Reality. This includes sensory input AND the associations/connections between them. The author explicitly states: \"any understanding we have of phenomena is based on phenomena.\" Buddhism expert notes the parallel with Yogacara: 境 is vijnapti-matra (appearance-only). Epistemology expert emphasizes: this is \"practical phenomenalism\" -- whether or not things exist beyond phenomena, only phenomena serve as starting points for justification. AVOID translating as \"appearances\" without caveat, as this risks suggesting phenomena are merely apparent.\n\n---\n\n## 感受 (ganshou)\n\n- **Main translation**: feeling\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"felt experience\" (when emphasizing experiential quality)\n  - \"experience\" (when broader scope needed)\n  - \"sensation\" (only when specifically about sensory input)\n  - \"lived experience\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"phenomenal experience\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"affection\" (Phenomenology, in Michel Henry contexts)\n- **Note**: All experts agree this is foundational. The author distinguishes two senses (footnote): (1) received stimuli/information, (2) the \"crystallization, surge, turbulence\" these give rise to. Both are 感受. P (phenomena) = the totality of all 感受. Meaning and feeling are \"two sides of one body.\" In the categorical framework, both objects (experiences) and morphisms (associations) are 感受 -- this is why E has tower structure. Buddhism expert notes this is broader than Buddhist vedana but includes it. Chinese Philosophy expert warns \"feeling\" in English can trivialize; consider \"felt experience\" when breadth is needed. Phenomenology expert connects to Husserl's Empfindung and Michel Henry's material phenomenology.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Phenomenology recommends \"feeling\" as main; Philosophy of Mind recommends \"lived experience\" or \"phenomenal experience\"; Epistemology recommends \"feeling / felt experience\"; Chinese Philosophy recommends \"felt experience\" or \"feeling.\" The core disagreement is between \"feeling\" (simpler, more accessible) and \"lived experience\" / \"phenomenal experience\" (more precise philosophically but heavier). **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"feeling\" as default, switching to \"felt experience\" when the broader phenomenological scope needs emphasis, and \"sensation\" only for explicitly sensory contexts.\n\n---\n\n## 恒常 (hengchang)\n\n- **Main translation**: constancy\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"permanence\" (too strong -- implies timeless eternality; use only in explicit Kantian First Analogy contexts)\n  - \"invariance\" (mathematical/formal contexts)\n  - \"stability\" (when referring to stable structures)\n- **Note**: All eight experts converge on \"constancy\" as the best translation. The author identifies this as \"the core of metaphysics.\" It is the non-rational demand we impose on phenomena: that patterns will hold, that the same causes produce the same effects, that identity persists across time. The author connects constancy to identity and causality, noting \"causality is just temporal identity.\" Chinese Philosophy expert emphasizes this is epistemological/pragmatic, NOT ontological -- we seek invariant patterns, not asserting things really are permanent. Buddhism expert notes the critical contrast with Buddhist anitya (impermanence): Buddhism sees pursuit of permanence as ignorance to overcome; the author sees pursuit of constancy as a non-rational feature to be recognized and worked with lucidly. Metaphysics expert: \"constancy\" avoids the excessive strength of \"permanence\" and the weakness of \"regularity.\"\n\n---\n\n## 诗意 (shiyi)\n\n- **Main translation**: the poetic\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"poetic dwelling\" (Heidegger connection)\n  - \"poetic engagement\" / \"poetic stance\" (emphasizing activity/orientation)\n  - \"poeticality\" (Buddhism expert)\n  - \"shiyi\" (untranslated, like Dasein; Existentialism)\n- **Note**: This is the author's central positive contribution -- the post-metaphysical existential stance. All experts agree it does NOT mean \"poetry\" in the literary sense. It is defined as \"the lucid dreamscape\": being fully invested in meaning while knowing that meaning is constructed. The author: \"After metaphysics, facing meaning should be poetic.\" Contrasted with the intoxicated dreamscape (pre-metaphysical belief/faith). Existentialism expert: differs from Nietzsche's voluntaristic amor fati, Camus's heroic revolt, and Heidegger's quietistic Gelassenheit -- it is active but not heroic, aware but not detached. Chinese Philosophy expert recommends capitalizing \"the Poetic\" to signal philosophical weight. Buddhism expert: this is genuinely novel, not found in Buddhist sources; it is the \"third way\" between intoxication and nihilistic void. Kantian expert: closer to Nietzsche's \"gay science\" than Kant's practical reason.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Buddhism expert recommends \"poeticality\" as main noun form; all others recommend \"the poetic.\" Chinese Philosophy recommends capitalization (\"the Poetic\") for emphasis. **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"the poetic\" as the standard substantive form, with \"poetic\" as adjective. \"Poeticality\" is acceptable as an occasional variant noun. Capitalize (\"the Poetic\") in the translator's introduction and glossary to signal philosophical weight.\n\n---\n\n## 梦境 (mengjing)\n\n- **Main translation**: dreamscape\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"dream-realm\" (emphasizing spatial/bounded quality)\n  - \"experiential milieu\" / \"meaning-field\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"experiential environment\" / \"meaning-world\" (Existentialism)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on \"dreamscape\" as the best main translation. The author explicitly states this is NOT just literal dreaming. Examples: games, novels, rituals, relationships, daily life. The \"dream\" metaphor captures: (1) constructed/artificial character, (2) immersive quality, (3) capacity to evoke powerful experience despite being constructed. Buddhism expert notes the Diamond Sutra parallel: \"All conditioned phenomena are like a dream\" -- but the author's dreamscape is NOT illusion to be escaped; it is structure to be engaged with lucidly.\n\n---\n\n## 境界 (jingjie)\n\n- **Main translation**: boundary / horizon\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"realm\" (when used to mean a delimited domain)\n  - \"bounds\" (Buddhism expert)\n  - \"domain\" (Phenomenology)\n  - \"sphere\" (Metaphysics)\n  - \"level of attainment\" (when Buddhist spiritual progress resonance is relevant)\n- **Note**: Distinguished from 境 (Jing). This compound emphasizes the boundary or limits of a domain. The author uses it in phrases like \"the boundary of language.\" Phenomenology expert: parallel to Husserl's \"horizon.\" Do NOT confuse with the technical term 境 (Jing).\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Metaphysics recommends \"boundary; horizon; limit\" as main. Phenomenology recommends \"realm.\" Buddhism recommends \"bounds, horizon, domain-and-limit.\" Chinese Philosophy recommends \"realm\" or \"experiential realm.\" **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"boundary\" or \"horizon\" when the author discusses limits of a domain; use \"realm\" when the author discusses the domain itself as a bounded space.\n\n---\n\n## 非理性 (feilixing)\n\n- **Main translation**: the non-rational\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"non-rationality\" (nominal form)\n  - \"arational\" (to avoid negative connotation of \"irrational\")\n  - \"extra-rational\" (emphasizing beyond-reason)\n  - \"beyond reason\" (discursive)\n  - AVOID: \"irrational\" (has pejorative connotations; means \"contrary to reason\")\n- **Note**: All eight experts agree this must NOT be translated as \"irrational.\" The author's argument: \"the purpose of reason must lie outside reason\" -- reason is a tool; its goals are non-rational. The pursuit of ultimate reality, the demand for constancy, the need for self-realization -- all are non-rational. This is NOT defective reasoning but a domain outside reason's reach. The author insists: \"this non-rationality should be acknowledged.\" Buddhism expert: parallels Buddhist tanha (craving), but Buddhism aims to overcome it while the author aims to recognize it and work with it lucidly.\n\n---\n\n## 形而上 (xing er shang)\n\n- **Main translation**: the metaphysical\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"metaphysical construct(s)\" (when referring to specific constructions)\n  - \"meta-formation\" (Phenomenology)\n  - \"supra-phenomenal\" (Kantian)\n  - \"above-form\" (literal, archaic, use sparingly)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on the critical distinction: 形而上 (the metaphysical, as content/construct) vs. 形而上学 (metaphysics, as discipline). The author reinterprets 形 as 现象 (phenomena), making 形而上 literally \"that which is above/upon phenomena.\" These are constructions we build upon phenomena that claim constancy/universality -- all Second Reality. Use \"the metaphysical\" (substantive) consistently; never collapse with \"metaphysics\" (the discipline).\n\n---\n\n## 形而上学 (xing er shang xue)\n\n- **Main translation**: metaphysics (the discipline)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"metaphysical inquiry\" (emphasizing investigative aspect)\n  - \"the study of the metaphysical\" (when clarifying distinction from 形而上)\n- **Note**: All experts agree. Standard translation. The author carefully distinguishes this from 形而上.\n\n---\n\n## 第一实在 (di yi shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: First Reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"primary reality\" (acceptable variant, but \"First\" preserves numbering)\n  - \"phenomenal reality\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"the originary given\" (Phenomenology, scholarly contexts)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on preserving the numbering system. This designates phenomena as what we encounter first, epistemically and practically. CRITICAL: The author explicitly states (footnote 25) that this is a name, not an ontological claim. It designates epistemic-practical priority. \"First\" means first in the order of access, not first in the order of being. Capitalize \"First Reality\" when used as technical term.\n\n---\n\n## 第二实在 (di er shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: Second Reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"constructed reality\" (explanatory gloss)\n  - \"constituted reality\" (Phenomenology)\n  - \"interpreted reality\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n- **Note**: All experts agree. Consists of constructions we build upon phenomena -- the \"things\" we posit as persisting objects, the concepts we abstract, the frameworks we assemble. The objective world is explicitly called a \"model\" based on phenomena. Whenever we articulate Zeroth Reality, the articulation itself becomes Second Reality. Capitalize \"Second Reality.\"\n\n---\n\n## 第〇实在 (di ling shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: Zeroth Reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Ultimate Reality\" (as explanatory gloss, but loses structural numbering)\n  - \"Reality-Zero\" (more colloquial)\n  - \"ground reality\" (Buddhism)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on preserving the \"zeroth\" numbering. This is what traditional metaphysics calls ultimate reality -- the Dao, the Unmoved Mover, God, the thing-in-itself. The \"zeroth\" numbering designates a structural placeholder we can never reach from within the system. Whenever articulated, it becomes Second Reality. AVOID: \"non-reality\" or \"zero reality\" (suggests non-existence rather than inaccessibility). Capitalize \"Zeroth Reality.\"\n\n---\n\n## 实在 (shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the real\" (substantive)\n  - \"actuality\" (when emphasizing concrete existence)\n- **Note**: When used without numerical prefix, 实在 means \"reality\" in the ordinary sense, but the author's framework implies we must always ask: which reality? Use \"Reality\" with capital R when part of the numbered system. AVOID: \"substance\" (Aristotelian baggage) or \"being\" (conflates with 存在).\n\n---\n\n## 清醒的梦境 (qingxing de mengjing)\n\n- **Main translation**: the lucid dreamscape\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the self-aware dreamscape\"\n  - \"the reflective dreamscape\"\n- **Note**: The author's term for post-metaphysical, poetic existence: being in a dreamscape while knowing you're in one, yet still fully investing. The author explicitly invokes \"lucid dreaming\" as the metaphor. Buddhism expert: parallels Chan awakening's third stage -- \"after enlightenment, mountains are mountains again.\" All experts agree \"lucid dreamscape\" perfectly captures the concept.\n\n---\n\n## 沉醉的梦境 (chenzui de mengjing)\n\n- **Main translation**: the intoxicated dreamscape\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the unreflective dreamscape\"\n  - \"the absorbed dreamscape\"\n- **Note**: Pre-metaphysical existence: being in a dreamscape without knowing you're in one. The author identifies this with belief/faith where purpose appears as logically groundless.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Phenomenology recommends \"absorbed\" over \"intoxicated\" (more neutral, less pejorative). Buddhism recommends \"intoxicated\" (preserves Buddhist resonance of mada, clouded awareness). **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"intoxicated\" as main translation to preserve the author's metaphor. Note in translator's introduction that this is descriptive, not pejorative.\n\n---\n\n## 清醒 (qingxing)\n\n- **Main translation**: lucid\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"awake\" (acceptable, especially in \"awake within the dream\")\n  - \"wakeful\" (Buddhism)\n  - \"clear-minded\" / \"clear-sighted\"\n- **Note**: All experts converge on \"lucid\" as the best translation. AVOID: \"awakened\" (too specifically Buddhist); \"conscious\" (too Cartesian/neutral).\n\n---\n\n## 沉醉 (chenzui)\n\n- **Main translation**: intoxicated\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"absorbed\" (Phenomenology)\n  - \"immersed\" (when intoxication metaphor is too strong)\n  - \"entranced\" (poetic contexts)\n- **Note**: Full absorption in a dreamscape without meta-awareness of its constructed nature. Literally \"sink-drunk.\"\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Phenomenology recommends \"absorbed\" (neutral); Buddhism/Existentialism/Metaphysics recommend \"intoxicated\" (faithful to metaphor). **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"intoxicated\" as default; \"absorbed\" when context demands neutrality.\n\n---\n\n## 联想 (lianxiang)\n\n- **Main translation**: association\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"associative connection\" (when emphasizing relational character)\n  - \"cognitive morphism\" (Philosophy of Mind, technical)\n  - \"associative morphism\" (Phenomenology, technical)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on \"association\" as the main translation. In the categorical framework, associations are the morphisms (arrows) connecting experiences within E. Crucially, associations are themselves experiences, which is why E has tower structure.\n\n---\n\n## 超越 (chaoyue)\n\n- **Main translation**: transcendence (noun) / to transcend (verb)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"going-beyond\" (verbal, less technical)\n  - \"surpass\" (when emphasizing exceeding limits)\n- **Note**: The author uses this in multiple senses: (1) the traditional metaphysical quest for Zeroth Reality (failed); (2) what lies outside the current boundary of thought; (3) immanent self-transformation through practice. AVOID: \"transcendental\" (Kantian term of art) unless specifically discussing Kant.\n\n---\n\n## 超越性 (chaoyuexing)\n\n- **Main translation**: transcendence (as quality/property) / transcendent character\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the transcendent\" (substantive)\n  - \"outward-reaching dimension\" (Existentialism)\n- **Note**: Key usage: \"one's own death is transcendent for oneself\" -- death is beyond the boundary of one's experiential sphere. Existentialism expert: sharp critique of Heidegger's Being-toward-death.\n\n---\n\n## 虚无 (xuwu)\n\n- **Main translation**: nothingness / the void\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"nihility\" (formal philosophical contexts)\n  - \"emptiness-as-absence\" (Buddhism, when distinguishing from 空)\n  - AVOID: \"emptiness\" (reserve for Buddhist 空/sunyata)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on the critical distinction from Buddhist 空 (emptiness/sunyata). The author's 虚无 is the void left when the highest values collapse -- not a positive entity but an absence. NEVER translate 虚无 as \"emptiness\" (which should be reserved for 空).\n\n---\n\n## 虚无主义 (xuwu zhuyi)\n\n- **Main translation**: nihilism\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the condition of nihility\" (when emphasizing state rather than doctrine)\n- **Note**: Standard translation. The author understands nihilism not as a doctrine but as a condition of meaning-loss.\n\n---\n\n## 后形而上学 (hou xing er shang xue)\n\n- **Main translation**: post-metaphysics\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"post-metaphysical thinking\" (echoing Habermas)\n- **Note**: All experts agree. Not \"after and done with\" metaphysics but \"after and transformed.\" AVOID: \"postmetaphysics\" (one word) which might suggest a total break rather than transformation.\n\n---\n\n## 前形而上学 (qian xing er shang xue)\n\n- **Main translation**: pre-metaphysics\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"traditional metaphysics\" (the author's own gloss)\n  - \"classical metaphysics\"\n  - \"pre-nihilist metaphysics\" (Chinese Philosophy expert)\n- **Note**: The author's term for the entire Western and Chinese metaphysical traditions before nihilism. The \"pre\" is relative to nihilism, not chronologically primitive.\n\n---\n\n## 存在 (cunzai)\n\n- **Main translation**: existence / being / to exist\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Being\" (capitalized, when discussing ontology or translating Heidegger's Sein)\n  - \"presence\" (Phenomenology, when emphasizing being-present)\n- **Note**: Context-dependent. The author's framework is cautious about ontology. Do NOT assume this maps cleanly onto Heidegger's Sein/Seiende distinction.\n\n---\n\n## 道 (dao)\n\n- **Main translation**: Dao (transliterated)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the Way\" (traditional rendering, acceptable with contextualization)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on transliteration. The author shows Dao is GENERATED last through progressive generalization from phenomena, not given first as the primordial source. Chinese Philosophy expert: \"genuinely original -- no classical Chinese philosopher has argued that 道 itself is a cognitive construction built from phenomenal observation upward.\"\n\n---\n\n## 德 (de)\n\n- **Main translation**: De (transliterated in philosophical passages); \"inherent character\" (when English gloss needed)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"virtue\" (Confucian moral contexts only)\n  - \"power\" / \"potency\" / \"efficacy\" (Daoist contexts)\n  - \"nature\" (in 人德 = human nature)\n- **Note**: Notoriously difficult. The author analyzes 德 as \"what makes a thing what it is\" -- the collection of properties we inductively generalize and then normatively impose as definitional.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Metaphysics recommends \"virtue (Confucian) / power (Daoist) / de (transliterated).\" Chinese Philosophy recommends \"De (romanized) or inherent character.\" Buddhism recommends \"virtue (moral) / potency or efficacy (Daoist).\" **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"De\" (transliterated) in philosophical passages about the 道德仁义礼 sequence. Use \"virtue\" only in explicitly Confucian moral contexts. Use \"efficacy\" or \"potency\" in Daoist cosmological contexts.\n\n---\n\n## 本质 (benzhi)\n\n- **Main translation**: essence / essential nature\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"nature\" (less technical)\n  - \"whatness\" (technical, echoing scholastic quidditas)\n- **Note**: In the author's framework, \"essence\" is reinterpreted: not a hidden inner nature but the universal property of a stable subcategory in E.\n\n---\n\n## 构造 (gouzao)\n\n- **Main translation**: construction / to construct\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"constitution\" (Phenomenology, for Husserl's Konstitution)\n  - \"structuration\" (when emphasizing process)\n  - \"synthesis\" (Kantian, when parallel is explicit)\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Phenomenology recommends \"constitution\" as main translation (to align with Husserl). All others recommend \"construction.\" **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"construction\" as default; \"constitution\" only when explicitly discussing Husserlian parallels.\n\n---\n\n## 实践 (shijian)\n\n- **Main translation**: practice / praxis\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"practical engagement\"\n  - \"praxis\" (Marxist/Aristotelian contexts)\n- **Note**: Core of the author's post-metaphysics. Defined as \"the overlap of ideal and phenomenon.\"\n\n---\n\n## 我 (wo)\n\n- **Main translation**: I / self\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the self\" (when discussing the concept philosophically)\n  - \"the I\" (when analyzing 我 as philosophical object)\n  - AVOID: \"ego\" (unless explicitly discussing Husserl's transcendental ego or Freud)\n- **Note**: The author provides a category-theoretic definition: \"I\" is the universal property (terminal object) of a subcategory of E containing all experiences related to me. This provides a structural, non-substantialist account of self.\n\n---\n\n## 自我 (ziwo)\n\n- **Main translation**: self (reflexive/philosophical)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"ego\" (only in explicit psychoanalytic contexts)\n  - \"oneself\" (reflexive usage)\n- **Note**: Distinguished from 我 by being reflexive/objectified. The self as object of reflection or concern.\n\n---\n\n## 自我实现 (ziwo shixian)\n\n- **Main translation**: self-realization\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"self-actualization\" (AVOID -- too Maslow-specific)\n- **Note**: The author glosses: \"making the self become actual/real.\" Tied to practice and the overlap of ideal and phenomenon.\n\n---\n\n## 意义 (yiyi)\n\n- **Main translation**: meaning / significance\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"significance\" (when emphasizing weight)\n  - \"sense\" (when emphasizing intelligibility)\n  - \"purpose\" (when teleological dimension is primary)\n- **Note**: Central to the author's argument: meaning and feeling are \"two sides of one body.\" Meaning IS felt experience. The attempt to seek meaning externally is the category error that generates absurdity.\n\n---\n\n## 理解 (lijie)\n\n- **Main translation**: understanding / to understand\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"comprehension\"\n- **Note**: The author formalizes understanding as a natural transformation between two functorial evolutions. Broader than 掌握 (mastery) -- there is a gradient.\n\n---\n\n## 掌握 (zhangwo)\n\n- **Main translation**: mastery / to grasp\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"command\" (emphasizing full competence)\n- **Note**: Technical term in the natural transformation analysis. To \"grasp\" a formula means the natural transformation component is the identity morphism -- no gap between your derivation and the truth.\n\n---\n\n## 知识 (zhishi)\n\n- **Main translation**: knowledge\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"belief taken to be correct\" (when emphasizing author's deflationary analysis)\n- **Note**: The author radically redefines knowledge by collapsing the JTB tripartite analysis.\n\n---\n\n## 信念 (xinnian)\n\n- **Main translation**: belief\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"doxastic state\" (technical epistemological contexts)\n  - \"conviction\" (when emphasizing strength)\n- **Note**: Central to the author's dissolution of JTB. The author argues all justification reduces to belief.\n\n---\n\n## 真理 (zhenli)\n\n- **Main translation**: truth\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"objective truth\" (when distinguishing from subjective belief)\n- **Note**: The author's treatment is deflationary. Truth is \"methodologically impossible\" to access directly.\n\n---\n\n## 辩护 / 证成\n\n- **Main translation**: justification\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"warrant\" (emphasizing epistemic entitlement)\n  - \"verification relation\" (in categorical framework)\n- **Note**: The author's central thesis is that justification reduces to belief.\n\n---\n\n## 理性 (lixing)\n\n- **Main translation**: reason / rationality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the rational\" (as substantive, contrasted with non-rational)\n  - \"rational faculty\" (when emphasizing Kant's Vernunft)\n- **Note**: The author argues reason is a tool whose purposes are non-rational.\n\n---\n\n## 先验 (xianyan)\n\n- **Main translation**: a priori / transcendental (context-dependent)\n- **Note**: The author's treatment is carefully agnostic. Stable structures preserved under evolution might include a priori elements. But this is descriptive, not transcendental deduction.\n\n---\n\n## 综合 (zonghe)\n\n- **Main translation**: synthesis / synthetic\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"integration\" (emphasizing unification)\n- **Note**: The author extends Kant's synthetic a priori from mathematics to the domain of meaning.\n\n---\n\n## 体验 (tiyan)\n\n- **Main translation**: lived experience\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"experience\" (when context is clear)\n  - \"Erlebnis\" (scholarly, Husserlian)\n  - \"experiential content\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n- **Note**: Often used interchangeably with 感受, but tends to emphasize more integrated, meaning-laden dimension. Closest to Husserl's Erlebnis.\n\n---\n\n## 经验 (jingyan)\n\n- **Main translation**: experience\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"empirical experience\" (to distinguish from 体验)\n  - \"Erfahrung\" (scholarly, contrasting with Erlebnis)\n- **Note**: Carries connotation of accumulated, reflected-upon, empirical experience.\n\n---\n\n## 意识 (yishi)\n\n- **Main translation**: consciousness\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"awareness\" (when emphasizing attentional aspect)\n- **Note**: In the framework, consciousness is the phenomenal field P from which 境 structures are constructed.\n\n---\n\n## 认知 (renzhi)\n\n- **Main translation**: cognition / cognitive structure\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"epistemic structure\" (when knowledge-focused)\n- **Note**: The framework distinguishes consciousness (phenomenal field P) from cognition (the category-theoretic structure 境 built upon P).\n\n---\n\n## 范畴 (fanchou)\n\n- **Main translation**: category\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"范畴论\" = \"category theory\" (the mathematical discipline)\n- **Note**: Dual usage: (1) Kantian categories, (2) mathematical category theory. The author primarily uses sense (2) but the overlap with sense (1) is intentional.\n\n---\n\n## 泛性质 / 范性质 (fan xingzhi)\n\n- **Main translation**: universal property\n- **Alternatives**: None (standard mathematical terminology)\n- **Note**: The author uses this philosophically: universal properties in subcategories of E correspond to what we experience as \"essences\" -- relocating essence from intrinsic nature to categorical position.\n\n---\n\n## 塔式结构 (ta shi jiegou)\n\n- **Main translation**: tower structure\n- **Alternatives**: None needed\n- **Note**: A category where morphisms are also objects, creating ascending levels. Formalized as T_0 -> T_1 -> T_2 -> ... -> T_infinity.\n\n---\n\n## 基石 (jishi)\n\n- **Main translation**: base stone / foundation stone\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"base object\" (more technical)\n  - \"starting point\"\n- **Note**: In the tower-structure construction, base stones are objects designated as foundational.

Chinese Philosophy expert insists on capitalization to signal philosophical weight.\n\n**Recommendation**: \"The poetic\" as standard; capitalize in glossary and introduction.\n\n---\n\n### 3. 沉醉 / 沉醉的梦境\n\n| Expert | Main Recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Metaphysics | intoxicated |\n| Phenomenology | absorbed |\n| Existentialism | intoxicated |\n| Philosophy of Mind | immersion / absorbed engagement / intoxication |\n| Chinese Philosophy | immersed / intoxicated |\n| Buddhism | intoxicated |\n\n**Tension**: \"Intoxicated\" preserves the Chinese metaphor and Buddhist resonance but carries potentially pejorative English connotations. \"Absorbed\" is more neutral but loses the critique of clouded judgment.\n\n**Recommendation**: \"Intoxicated\" as default; translator's note clarifying this is descriptive, not pejorative.\n\n---\n\n### 4. 境界 (jingjie)\n\n| Expert | Main Recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Metaphysics | boundary; horizon; limit |\n| Phenomenology | realm |\n| Chinese Philosophy | realm / experiential realm |\n| Buddhism | bounds, horizon, domain-and-limit |\n\n**Tension**: \"Boundary/horizon\" emphasizes the limit-character; \"realm\" emphasizes the domain-character. The author uses both senses.\n\n**Recommendation**: Context-dependent. \"Boundary\" or \"horizon\" when discussing limits; \"realm\" when discussing the domain itself.\n\n---\n\n### 5. 构造 (gouzao)\n\n| Expert | Main Recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Metaphysics | construction |\n| Phenomenology | constitution |\n| Epistemology | construction |\n| Philosophy of Mind | construction / structuring |\n| Kantian | construction / constitute |\n\n**Tension**: Phenomenology expert prefers \"constitution\" to align with Husserl. All others prefer \"construction.\"\n\n**Recommendation**: \"Construction\" as default; \"constitution\" only in explicitly Husserlian comparative passages.\n\n---\n\n### 6. 德 (de)\n\n| Expert | Main Recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Metaphysics | virtue / power / de (context-dependent) |\n| Chinese Philosophy | De (romanized) / inherent character |\n| Buddhism | virtue / potency or efficacy |\n\n**Tension**: Radically different meanings in Confucian, Daoist, and the author's contexts. \"Virtue\" imports inappropriate moral connotations for the author's general usage.\n\n**Recommendation**: \"De\" (transliterated) in philosophical passages; context-specific translations with translator's notes elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n### 7. 虚无 (xuwu)\n\n| Expert | Main Recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Metaphysics | nothingness; the void |\n| Phenomenology | nothingness |\n| Epistemology | nihility / the void |\n| Existentialism | the void / nothingness |\n| Chinese Philosophy | the void / nothingness |\n| Buddhism | the void / emptiness-as-absence |\n\n**Tension**: Minor. \"Nothingness\" vs. \"the void\" -- both acceptable. Key consensus: NEVER use \"emptiness\" (reserved for Buddhist 空).\n\n**Recommendation**: Use \"nothingness\" or \"the void\" depending on context; both acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**End of Master Dictionary**\n\nThis document should be used as the authoritative reference for all translation decisions. Where disagreements remain unresolved, the author should make final determinations.

Epistemology\n4. Existentialism\n5. Philosophy of Mind\n6. Kantian/Transcendental Philosophy\n7. Chinese Philosophy\n8. Buddhism (Madhyamaka/Yogacara/Chan-Zen)\n\n**Date:** 2026-02-10\n\n**Purpose:** This is the authoritative reference document for the English translation of the Jing Ji collection. It synthesizes recommendations from all eight expert perspectives into a single consensus dictionary, preserving expert agreement, flagging disagreements, and providing the translator with clear guidance for every key term. Terms are ordered by importance and frequency of use in the essays.\n\n**How to Use This Dictionary:**\n- Each entry shows the consensus translation (or best-judgment call where experts disagree).\n- The DISAGREEMENT line appears only when experts propose genuinely different main translations.\n- Notes synthesize insights from all relevant experts.\n- A Disagreements Summary at the end collects all disputed terms for the author's review.\n\n---\n\n## 境 (jing)\n\n- **Main translation**: Jing (romanized, as technical term)\n- **Alternatives**: \"E\" (formal/category-theoretic passages); \"experiential realm\" (discursive); \"experiential field\" / \"experiential milieu\" (Phenomenology); \"scape\" / \"experiential scape\" (Buddhism); \"cognitive-scape\" (Philosophy of Mind); \"sphere\" (Metaphysics, literary contexts)\n- **Note**: The single most important and difficult term. All eight experts agree it resists single-word translation. The author defines it as a category-theoretic structure on phenomena (P): objects are selected experiences, morphisms are associations, and morphisms are also objects (tower structure). It evolves dynamically via functors. Resonates with Buddhist visaya/gocara, Husserl's Lebenswelt, Heidegger's Welt, and Chinese 意境. Six of eight experts recommend \"Jing\" transliterated with explanatory apparatus; two suggest descriptive glosses. Do NOT collapse into traditional Buddhist 境界 or aesthetic 意境. Use \"Jing\" consistently, with \"E\" in mathematical passages.\n\n---\n\n## 现象 (xianxiang)\n\n- **Main translation**: phenomena (plural) / phenomenon (singular)\n- **Alternatives**: \"the phenomenal\" (substantive); \"phenomenal given\" (Philosophy of Mind); \"appearance\" (only with strong caveat)\n- **Note**: All experts agree. Used with full phenomenological weight. NOT \"mere appearances\" -- the indubitable ground of all experience, identified with \"all feelings taken together.\" Phenomena = First Reality. AVOID \"appearances\" without caveat.\n\n---\n\n## 感受 (ganshou)\n\n- **Main translation**: feeling\n- **Alternatives**: \"felt experience\" (broader scope); \"experience\"; \"sensation\" (sensory only); \"lived experience\" (Phil. of Mind); \"phenomenal experience\" (Phil. of Mind)\n- **Note**: Foundational term. Two senses: (1) received stimuli, (2) the \"crystallization, surge, turbulence\" these produce. P = the totality of all 感受. Meaning and feeling are \"two sides of one body.\" Both objects and morphisms in E are 感受.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Philosophy of Mind recommends \"lived experience\" / \"phenomenal experience\"; others recommend \"feeling\" or \"felt experience.\" Resolution: Use \"feeling\" as default, \"felt experience\" when broader scope needed.\n\n---\n\n## 恒常 (hengchang)\n\n- **Main translation**: constancy\n- **Alternatives**: \"permanence\" (too strong); \"invariance\" (math contexts); \"stability\" (stable structures)\n- **Note**: All eight experts converge. \"The core of metaphysics.\" Non-rational demand for patterns to hold. Connected to identity and causality (\"causality is just temporal identity\"). Epistemological/pragmatic, NOT ontological. Buddhism: contrasts with anitya (impermanence).\n\n---\n\n## 诗意 (shiyi)\n\n- **Main translation**: the poetic\n- **Alternatives**: \"poetic dwelling\"; \"poetic engagement\" / \"poetic stance\"; \"poeticality\" (Buddhism); \"shiyi\" (untranslated)\n- **Note**: The author's central positive contribution. NOT \"poetry\" in literary sense. Defined as \"the lucid dreamscape\": full investment in meaning while knowing it is constructed. The \"third way\" between intoxication and nihilistic void.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Buddhism recommends \"poeticality\"; Chinese Philosophy recommends capitalization (\"the Poetic\"). Resolution: \"The poetic\" standard; capitalize in glossary/introduction.\n\n---\n\n## 梦境 (mengjing)\n\n- **Main translation**: dreamscape\n- **Alternatives**: \"dream-realm\"; \"experiential milieu\" / \"meaning-field\" (Phil. of Mind)\n- **Note**: All experts agree. NOT just literal dreaming. Any structured experiential environment in which meaning arises. NOT illusion to be escaped but structure to be engaged with lucidly.\n\n---\n\n## 境界 (jingjie)\n\n- **Main translation**: boundary / horizon\n- **Alternatives**: \"realm\" (delimited domain); \"bounds\" (Buddhism); \"domain\" (Phenomenology); \"sphere\" (Metaphysics)\n- **Note**: Distinguished from 境 (Jing). Emphasizes boundary or limits of a domain. Parallel to Husserl's \"horizon.\"\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Metaphysics: \"boundary; horizon; limit.\" Phenomenology: \"realm.\" Buddhism: \"bounds, horizon.\" Chinese Philosophy: \"realm.\" Resolution: Context-dependent.\n\n---\n\n## 非理性 (feilixing)\n\n- **Main translation**: the non-rational\n- **Alternatives**: \"non-rationality\"; \"arational\"; \"extra-rational\"; AVOID \"irrational\"\n- **Note**: All eight experts agree: NOT \"irrational.\" Outside reason's domain, not contrary to it. \"The purpose of reason must lie outside reason.\" Must be acknowledged, not overcome.\n\n---\n\n## 形而上 (xing er shang)\n\n- **Main translation**: the metaphysical\n- **Alternatives**: \"metaphysical construct(s)\"; \"meta-formation\" (Phenomenology); \"supra-phenomenal\" (Kantian)\n- **Note**: Critical distinction from 形而上学 (metaphysics as discipline). Constructions upon phenomena that claim constancy/universality -- all Second Reality.\n\n---\n\n## 形而上学 (xing er shang xue)\n\n- **Main translation**: metaphysics (the discipline)\n- **Note**: All experts agree. Standard translation. Distinguished from 形而上.\n\n---\n\n## 第一实在 (di yi shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: First Reality\n- **Note**: All experts agree on preserving numbering. Epistemic-practical priority, NOT ontological claim. Capitalize as technical term.\n\n---\n\n## 第二实在 (di er shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: Second Reality\n- **Note**: All experts agree. Constructions upon phenomena. The \"objective world\" is a model. Capitalize.\n\n---\n\n## 第〇实在 (di ling shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: Zeroth Reality\n- **Note**: All experts agree. Traditional \"ultimate reality.\" Structurally unreachable. AVOID \"non-reality\" or \"zero reality.\" Capitalize.\n\n---\n\n## 实在 (shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: reality\n- **Note**: Capitalize \"Reality\" when part of numbered system. AVOID \"substance\" or \"being.\"\n\n---\n\n## 清醒的梦境\n\n- **Main translation**: the lucid dreamscape\n- **Note**: Post-metaphysical poetic existence. All experts agree this perfectly captures the concept.\n\n---\n\n## 沉醉的梦境\n\n- **Main translation**: the intoxicated dreamscape\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Phenomenology: \"absorbed.\" Buddhism/Existentialism/Metaphysics: \"intoxicated.\" Resolution: \"Intoxicated\" as default; translator's note that this is descriptive, not pejorative.\n\n---\n\n## 清醒 (qingxing)\n\n- **Main translation**: lucid\n- **Note**: All experts converge. AVOID \"awakened\" (too Buddhist) or \"conscious\" (too Cartesian).\n\n---\n\n## 沉醉 (chenzui)\n\n- **Main translation**: intoxicated\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Phenomenology: \"absorbed.\" Others: \"intoxicated.\" Resolution: \"Intoxicated\" as default.\n\n---\n\n## 联想 (lianxiang)\n\n- **Main translation**: association\n- **Note**: All experts agree.

Metaphysics\n2. Phenomenology\n3. Epistemology\n4. Existentialism\n5. Philosophy of Mind\n6. Kantian/Transcendental Philosophy\n7. Chinese Philosophy\n8. Buddhism (Madhyamaka/Yogacara/Chan-Zen)\n\n**Date:** 2026-02-10\n\n**Purpose:** This is the authoritative reference document for the English translation of the Jing Ji collection. It synthesizes recommendations from all eight expert perspectives into a single consensus dictionary, preserving expert agreement, flagging disagreements, and providing the translator with clear guidance for every key term. Terms are ordered by importance and frequency of use in the essays.\n\n**How to Use This Dictionary:**\n- Each entry shows the consensus translation (or best-judgment call where experts disagree).\n- The DISAGREEMENT line appears only when experts propose genuinely different main translations.\n- Notes synthesize insights from all relevant experts.\n- A Disagreements Summary at the end collects all disputed terms for the author's review.\n\n---\n\n## 境 (jing)\n\n- **Main translation**: Jing (romanized, as technical term)\n- **Alternatives**: \"E\" (formal/category-theoretic passages); \"experiential realm\" (discursive); \"experiential field\" / \"experiential milieu\" (Phenomenology); \"scape\" / \"experiential scape\" (Buddhism); \"cognitive-scape\" (Philosophy of Mind); \"sphere\" (Metaphysics, literary contexts)\n- **Note**: The single most important and difficult term. All eight experts agree it resists single-word translation. The author defines it as a category-theoretic structure on phenomena (P): objects are selected experiences, morphisms are associations, and morphisms are also objects (tower structure). It evolves dynamically via functors. Resonates with Buddhist visaya/gocara, Husserl's Lebenswelt, Heidegger's Welt, and Chinese aesthetic 意境. Six of eight experts recommend \"Jing\" transliterated with explanatory apparatus; two suggest descriptive glosses. Do NOT collapse into traditional Buddhist 境界 or aesthetic 意境. Use \"Jing\" consistently, with \"E\" in mathematical passages.\n\n---\n\n## 现象 (xianxiang)\n\n- **Main translation**: phenomena (plural) / phenomenon (singular)\n- **Alternatives**: \"the phenomenal\" (substantive); \"phenomenal given\" (Phil. of Mind); \"appearance\" (only with strong caveat)\n- **Note**: All experts agree. Full phenomenological weight, closer to Husserl than Kant. NOT \"mere appearances\" -- the indubitable ground of all experience. Phenomena = First Reality. AVOID \"appearances\" without caveat.\n\n---\n\n## 感受 (ganshou)\n\n- **Main translation**: feeling\n- **Alternatives**: \"felt experience\" (broader scope); \"lived experience\" (Phil. of Mind); \"sensation\" (sensory only)\n- **Note**: Foundational. Two senses: (1) received stimuli, (2) the \"crystallization, surge, turbulence\" these produce. P = totality of all 感受. Meaning and feeling are \"two sides of one body.\" Both objects and morphisms in E are 感受.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Philosophy of Mind recommends \"lived experience\" / \"phenomenal experience\"; others recommend \"feeling\" or \"felt experience.\" Resolution: \"feeling\" as default, \"felt experience\" when broader scope needed.\n\n---\n\n## 恒常 (hengchang)\n\n- **Main translation**: constancy\n- **Alternatives**: \"permanence\" (too strong); \"invariance\" (math contexts); \"stability\" (stable structures)\n- **Note**: All eight experts converge. \"The core of metaphysics.\" Non-rational demand for patterns to hold. Connected to identity and causality. Epistemological/pragmatic, NOT ontological. Buddhism: contrasts with anitya (impermanence) -- author seeks to recognize constancy-seeking lucidly, not overcome it.\n\n---\n\n## 诗意 (shiyi)\n\n- **Main translation**: the poetic\n- **Alternatives**: \"poetic dwelling\"; \"poetic engagement\"; \"poeticality\" (Buddhism); \"shiyi\" (untranslated)\n- **Note**: Author's central positive contribution. NOT literary poetry. Defined as \"the lucid dreamscape.\" The \"third way\" between intoxication and nihilistic void.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Buddhism: \"poeticality.\" Chinese Philosophy: \"the Poetic\" (capitalized). Resolution: \"the poetic\" standard; capitalize in glossary/introduction.\n\n---\n\n## 梦境 (mengjing)\n\n- **Main translation**: dreamscape\n- **Alternatives**: \"dream-realm\"; \"experiential milieu\"; \"meaning-field\"\n- **Note**: All experts agree. NOT just literal dreaming. Any structured experiential environment in which meaning arises. NOT illusion to escape but structure to engage with lucidly.\n\n---\n\n## 境界 (jingjie)\n\n- **Main translation**: boundary / horizon\n- **Alternatives**: \"realm\" (delimited domain); \"bounds\" (Buddhism); \"domain\"; \"sphere\"\n- **Note**: Distinguished from 境 (Jing). Emphasizes boundary or limits of a domain.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Metaphysics: \"boundary; horizon; limit.\" Phenomenology: \"realm.\" Chinese Philosophy: \"realm.\" Resolution: Context-dependent.\n\n---\n\n## 非理性 (feilixing)\n\n- **Main translation**: the non-rational\n- **Alternatives**: \"non-rationality\"; \"arational\"; AVOID \"irrational\"\n- **Note**: All eight experts agree: NOT \"irrational.\" Outside reason's domain, not contrary to it. Must be acknowledged, not overcome.\n\n---\n\n## 形而上 (xing er shang)\n\n- **Main translation**: the metaphysical\n- **Note**: Critical distinction from 形而上学 (discipline). Constructions upon phenomena that claim constancy/universality -- all Second Reality.\n\n---\n\n## 形而上学 (xing er shang xue)\n\n- **Main translation**: metaphysics (the discipline)\n- **Note**: Standard translation. Distinguished from 形而上.\n\n---\n\n## 第一实在 (di yi shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: First Reality\n- **Note**: Epistemic-practical priority, NOT ontological claim. Capitalize.\n\n---\n\n## 第二实在 (di er shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: Second Reality\n- **Note**: Constructions upon phenomena. The \"objective world\" is a model. Capitalize.\n\n---\n\n## 第〇实在 (di ling shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: Zeroth Reality\n- **Note**: Structurally unreachable. AVOID \"non-reality\" or \"zero reality.\" Capitalize.\n\n---\n\n## 实在 (shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: reality\n- **Note**: Capitalize when part of numbered system.\n\n---\n\n## 清醒的梦境\n\n- **Main translation**: the lucid dreamscape\n\n---\n\n## 沉醉的梦境\n\n- **Main translation**: the intoxicated dreamscape\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Phenomenology: \"absorbed.\" Others: \"intoxicated.\" Resolution: \"intoxicated\" as default; translator's note it is descriptive, not pejorative.\n\n---\n\n## 清醒 (qingxing)\n\n- **Main translation**: lucid\n- **Note**: AVOID \"awakened\" (too Buddhist) or \"conscious\" (too Cartesian).\n\n---\n\n## 沉醉 (chenzui)\n\n- **Main translation**: intoxicated\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Phenomenology: \"absorbed.\" Others: \"intoxicated.\" Resolution: \"intoxicated\" default.\n\n---\n\n## 联想 (lianxiang)\n\n- **Main translation**: association\n- **Note**: Morphisms in E. Themselves experiences (tower structure).\n\n---\n\n## 超越 (chaoyue)\n\n- **Main translation**: transcendence / to transcend\n- **Note**: AVOID \"transcendental\" unless discussing Kant.\n\n---\n\n## 超越性 (chaoyuexing)\n\n- **Main translation**: transcendence (as quality) / transcendent character\n\n---\n\n## 虚无 (xuwu)\n\n- **Main translation**: nothingness / the void\n- **Note**: NEVER translate as \"emptiness\" (reserve for Buddhist 空).

Synthesizes all eight expert perspectives. Terms ordered by importance. Disagreements flagged for author review.\n\n---\n\n## 境 (jing)\n- **Main translation**: Jing (romanized, as technical term)\n- **Alternatives**: \"E\" (formal passages); \"experiential realm\" (discursive); \"scape\" (Buddhism); \"sphere\" (Metaphysics)\n- **Note**: Most important and difficult term. Category-theoretic structure on phenomena. Use \"Jing\" consistently, \"E\" in math passages. Do NOT collapse into 境界 or 意境.\n\n## 现象 (xianxiang)\n- **Main translation**: phenomena / phenomenon\n- **Note**: All experts agree. Full phenomenological weight. NOT \"mere appearances.\" = First Reality.\n\n## 感受 (ganshou)\n- **Main translation**: feeling\n- **Alternatives**: \"felt experience\" (broader); \"lived experience\" (Phil. of Mind)\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Phil. of Mind: \"lived experience.\" Others: \"feeling.\" Resolution: \"feeling\" default, \"felt experience\" when broader scope needed.\n\n## 恒常 (hengchang)\n- **Main translation**: constancy\n- **Note**: All eight experts converge. \"The core of metaphysics.\" Epistemological, NOT ontological.\n\n## 诗意 (shiyi)\n- **Main translation**: the poetic\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Buddhism: \"poeticality.\" Chinese Phil: \"the Poetic\" (capitalized).

Metaphysics\n2. Phenomenology\n3. Epistemology\n4. Existentialism\n5. Philosophy of Mind\n6. Kantian/Transcendental Philosophy\n7. Chinese Philosophy\n8. Buddhism (Madhyamaka/Yogacara/Chan-Zen)\n\n**Date:** 2026-02-10\n**Purpose:** This is the authoritative reference document for the English translation of the **Jing Ji** (境集) collection. It synthesizes recommendations from all eight expert perspectives into a single consensus dictionary, preserving expert agreement, flagging disagreements, and providing the translator with clear guidance for every key term. Terms are ordered by importance and frequency of use in the essays.\n\n**How to Use This Dictionary:**\n- Each entry shows the consensus translation (or best-judgment call where experts disagree).\n- The **DISAGREEMENT** line appears only when experts propose genuinely different main translations. Stylistic variations (e.g., capitalization) are noted under Alternatives, not flagged as disagreements.\n- Notes synthesize insights from all relevant experts. The goal is to give the translator maximum context in minimum space.\n- A Disagreements Summary at the end collects all disputed terms for the author's review.\n\n---\n\n## 境 (jing)\n\n- **Main translation**: Jing (romanized, as technical term)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"E\" (in formal/category-theoretic passages, as the author uses)\n  - \"experiential realm\" (discursive contexts)\n  - \"experiential field\" / \"experiential milieu\" (Phenomenology)\n  - \"scape\" / \"experiential scape\" (Buddhism)\n  - \"cognitive-scape\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"sphere\" (Metaphysics, in literary contexts)\n- **Note**: This is the single most important and most difficult term in the entire collection. All eight experts agree it resists single-word translation. The author defines it as a category-theoretic structure on phenomena (P): objects are selected experiences (感受), morphisms are associations (联想), and morphisms are also objects (tower structure). It evolves dynamically via functors. The term resonates with Buddhist *visaya*/*gocara* (object-domain of consciousness), Husserl's Lebenswelt, Heidegger's Welt, and the Chinese aesthetic tradition of 意境. The author considers alternative names: \"game, book, adventure, small world, small freedom.\" Six of eight experts recommend keeping \"Jing\" transliterated with an explanatory apparatus on first use; two suggest descriptive glosses (\"experiential field,\" \"scape\"). Do NOT collapse into traditional Buddhist 境界 (spiritual attainment) or aesthetic 意境 -- the author's usage is formally precise. Use \"Jing\" consistently, with \"E\" in mathematical/formal passages.\n\n---\n\n## 现象 (xianxiang)\n\n- **Main translation**: phenomena (plural) / phenomenon (singular)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the phenomenal\" (when used substantively for the field as a whole)\n  - \"phenomenal given\" (emphasizing givenness, Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"appearance\" (only with strong caveat -- see note)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on \"phenomena\" as main translation. The author uses this term with full phenomenological weight, closer to Husserl's *Phanomen* than to Kant's *Erscheinung*. Phenomena are NOT \"mere appearances\" behind which a truer reality hides; they are the indubitable ground of all experience, identified with \"all feelings taken together\" (全部的感受之总和). Phenomena = First Reality (第一实在). This includes sensory input AND the associations/connections between them. The author explicitly states: \"any understanding we have of phenomena is based on phenomena.\" Buddhism expert notes the parallel with Yogacara: 境 is *vijnapti-matra* (appearance-only). Epistemology expert emphasizes: this is \"practical phenomenalism\" -- whether or not things exist beyond phenomena, only phenomena serve as starting points for justification. AVOID translating as \"appearances\" without caveat, as this risks suggesting phenomena are merely apparent.\n\n---\n\n## 感受 (ganshou)\n\n- **Main translation**: feeling\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"felt experience\" (when emphasizing experiential quality)\n  - \"experience\" (when broader scope needed)\n  - \"sensation\" (only when specifically about sensory input)\n  - \"lived experience\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"phenomenal experience\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"affection\" (Phenomenology, in Michel Henry contexts)\n- **Note**: All experts agree this is foundational. The author distinguishes two senses (footnote): (1) received stimuli/information, (2) the \"crystallization, surge, turbulence\" these give rise to. Both are 感受. P (phenomena) = \"全部的感受之总和\" (the totality of all 感受). Meaning and feeling are \"two sides of one body\" (意义和感受即是两面一体). In the categorical framework, both objects (experiences) and morphisms (associations) are 感受 -- this is why E has tower structure. Buddhism expert notes this is broader than Buddhist *vedana* (受, feeling-tone) but includes it. Chinese Philosophy expert warns \"feeling\" in English can trivialize; consider \"felt experience\" when breadth is needed. Phenomenology expert connects to Husserl's *Empfindung* and Michel Henry's material phenomenology.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Phenomenology recommends \"feeling\" as main; Philosophy of Mind recommends \"lived experience\" or \"phenomenal experience\"; Epistemology recommends \"feeling / felt experience\"; Chinese Philosophy recommends \"felt experience\" or \"feeling.\" The core disagreement is between \"feeling\" (simpler, more accessible) and \"lived experience\" / \"phenomenal experience\" (more precise philosophically but heavier). **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"feeling\" as default, switching to \"felt experience\" when the broader phenomenological scope needs emphasis, and \"sensation\" only for explicitly sensory contexts.\n\n---\n\n## 恒常 (hengchang)\n\n- **Main translation**: constancy\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"permanence\" (too strong -- implies timeless eternality; use only in explicit Kantian First Analogy contexts)\n  - \"invariance\" (mathematical/formal contexts)\n  - \"stability\" (when referring to stable structures)\n- **Note**: All eight experts converge on \"constancy\" as the best translation. The author identifies this as \"the core of metaphysics\" (形而上的核心是恒常). It is the non-rational demand we impose on phenomena: that patterns will hold, that the same causes produce the same effects, that identity persists across time. The author connects constancy to identity (同一) and causality (因果), noting \"causality is just temporal identity.\" Chinese Philosophy expert emphasizes this is epistemological/pragmatic, NOT ontological -- we *seek* invariant patterns, not asserting things really are permanent. Buddhism expert notes the critical contrast with Buddhist *anitya* (无常, impermanence): Buddhism sees pursuit of permanence as ignorance to overcome; the author sees pursuit of constancy as a non-rational feature to be *recognized and worked with lucidly*. Metaphysics expert: \"constancy\" avoids the excessive strength of \"permanence\" and the weakness of \"regularity.\"\n\n---\n\n## 诗意 (shiyi)\n\n- **Main translation**: the poetic\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"poetic dwelling\" (Heidegger connection)\n  - \"poetic engagement\" / \"poetic stance\" (emphasizing activity/orientation)\n  - \"poeticality\" (Buddhism expert)\n  - \"*shiyi*\" (untranslated, like *Dasein*; Existentialism)\n- **Note**: This is the author's central positive contribution -- the post-metaphysical existential stance. All experts agree it does NOT mean \"poetry\" in the literary sense. It is defined as \"清醒的梦境\" (the lucid dreamscape): being fully invested in meaning while knowing that meaning is constructed. The author: \"After metaphysics, facing meaning should be poetic.\" Contrasted with 沉醉的梦境 (intoxicated dreamscape = pre-metaphysical belief/faith). Existentialism expert: differs from Nietzsche's voluntaristic *amor fati*, Camus's heroic revolt, and Heidegger's quietistic *Gelassenheit* -- it is active but not heroic, aware but not detached. Chinese Philosophy expert recommends capitalizing \"the Poetic\" to signal philosophical weight. Buddhism expert: this is genuinely novel, not found in Buddhist sources; it is the \"third way\" between intoxication and nihilistic void. Kantian expert: closer to Nietzsche's \"gay science\" than Kant's practical reason.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Buddhism expert recommends \"poeticality\" as main noun form; all others recommend \"the poetic.\" Chinese Philosophy recommends capitalization (\"the Poetic\") for emphasis. **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"the poetic\" as the standard substantive form, with \"poetic\" as adjective. \"Poeticality\" is acceptable as an occasional variant noun. Capitalize (\"the Poetic\") in the translator's introduction and glossary to signal philosophical weight.\n\n---\n\n## 梦境 (mengjing)\n\n- **Main translation**: dreamscape\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"dream-realm\" (emphasizing spatial/bounded quality)\n  - \"experiential milieu\" / \"meaning-field\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"experiential environment\" / \"meaning-world\" (Existentialism)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on \"dreamscape\" as the best main translation. The author explicitly states this is NOT just literal dreaming: \"任何感受都有使得他得以展现的'环境'\" (any feeling has an 'environment' that enables it to manifest). Examples: games, novels, rituals, relationships, daily life. The \"dream\" metaphor captures: (1) constructed/artificial character, (2) immersive quality, (3) capacity to evoke powerful experience despite being constructed. Chinese Philosophy expert recommends \"dream-realm\" as alternative to preserve both 梦 and 境 components. Buddhism expert notes the Diamond Sutra parallel: \"All conditioned phenomena are like a dream\" -- but the author's dreamscape is NOT illusion to be escaped; it is structure to be engaged with lucidly. The dreamscape is where meaning and feeling become \"two sides of one body.\"\n\n---\n\n## 境界 (jingjie)\n\n- **Main translation**: boundary / horizon\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"realm\" (when used to mean a delimited domain)\n  - \"bounds\" (Buddhism expert)\n  - \"domain\" (Phenomenology)\n  - \"sphere\" (Metaphysics)\n  - \"level of attainment\" (when Buddhist spiritual progress resonance is relevant)\n- **Note**: Distinguished from 境 (Jing). This compound (境 + 界 boundary/limit) emphasizes the boundary or limits of a domain. The author uses it in phrases like \"语言的境界\" (the boundary of language). Phenomenology expert: parallel to Husserl's \"horizon\" (*Horizont*). Buddhism expert: carries both spatial sense (extent of domain) and soteriological sense (level of attainment). Chinese Philosophy expert: in its most general sense, \"the world as experienced from a particular standpoint.\" Do NOT confuse with the technical term 境 (Jing). Context determines translation: \"boundary/horizon\" when emphasizing limits, \"realm\" when emphasizing delimited domain.\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Metaphysics recommends \"boundary; horizon; limit\" as main. Phenomenology recommends \"realm.\" Buddhism recommends \"bounds, horizon, domain-and-limit.\" Chinese Philosophy recommends \"realm\" or \"experiential realm.\" **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"boundary\" or \"horizon\" when the author discusses limits of a domain; use \"realm\" when the author discusses the domain itself as a bounded space.\n\n---\n\n## 非理性 (feilixing)\n\n- **Main translation**: the non-rational\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"non-rationality\" (nominal form)\n  - \"arational\" (to avoid negative connotation of \"irrational\")\n  - \"extra-rational\" (emphasizing beyond-reason)\n  - \"beyond reason\" (discursive)\n  - AVOID: \"irrational\" (has pejorative connotations; means \"contrary to reason\")\n- **Note**: All eight experts agree this must NOT be translated as \"irrational.\" The author's argument: \"the purpose of reason must lie outside reason\" -- reason is a tool; its goals are non-rational. The pursuit of ultimate reality, the demand for constancy, the need for self-realization -- all are non-rational. This is NOT defective reasoning but a domain outside reason's reach. The author insists: \"this non-rationality should be acknowledged\" (承认). Epistemology expert: resolves the regress problem differently than foundationalism or coherentism -- the regress ends in non-rational commitment, which is accepted rather than disguised. Buddhism expert: parallels Buddhist *tanha* (craving), but Buddhism aims to overcome it while the author aims to recognize it and work with it lucidly. Kantian expert: departure from Kant, for whom reason's demand for the unconditioned is rational.\n\n---\n\n## 形而上 (xing er shang)\n\n- **Main translation**: the metaphysical\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"metaphysical construct(s)\" (when referring to specific constructions)\n  - \"meta-formation\" (Phenomenology)\n  - \"supra-phenomenal\" (Kantian)\n  - \"above-form\" (literal, archaic, use sparingly)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on the critical distinction: 形而上 (the metaphysical, as content/construct) vs. 形而上学 (metaphysics, as discipline). The author reinterprets 形 as 现象 (phenomena), making 形而上 literally \"that which is above/upon phenomena.\" These are constructions we build upon phenomena that claim constancy/universality -- all Second Reality. The author's formal definition: \"a metaphysical m is an association in E, and m is a universal property in some subcategory of E.\" Chinese Philosophy expert emphasizes the author's claim that Chinese philosophy is mostly 有形而上而无形而上学 (has metaphysical frameworks but lacks systematic metaphysical inquiry). Use \"the metaphysical\" (substantive) consistently; never collapse with \"metaphysics\" (the discipline).\n\n---\n\n## 形而上学 (xing er shang xue)\n\n- **Main translation**: metaphysics (the discipline)\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"metaphysical inquiry\" (emphasizing investigative aspect)\n  - \"the study of the metaphysical\" (when clarifying distinction from 形而上)\n- **Note**: All experts agree. Standard translation. The author carefully distinguishes this from 形而上.\n\n---\n\n## 第一实在 (di yi shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: First Reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"primary reality\" (acceptable variant, but \"First\" preserves numbering)\n  - \"phenomenal reality\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n  - \"the originary given\" (Phenomenology, scholarly contexts)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on preserving the numbering system. This designates phenomena (现象) as what we encounter first, epistemically and practically. CRITICAL: The author explicitly states (footnote 25) that this is a *name* (名称), not an ontological claim that phenomena are the \"most real\" stuff of reality. It designates epistemic-practical priority: phenomena are indubitable, cannot be bypassed, and are the necessary starting point. \"First\" means first in the order of access, not first in the order of being. Capitalize \"First Reality\" when used as technical term.\n\n---\n\n## 第二实在 (di er shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: Second Reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"constructed reality\" (explanatory gloss)\n  - \"constituted reality\" (Phenomenology)\n  - \"interpreted reality\" (Philosophy of Mind)\n- **Note**: All experts agree. Consists of constructions we build upon phenomena -- the \"things\" we posit as persisting objects, the concepts we abstract, the frameworks we assemble. The objective world (客观世界) is explicitly called a \"model\" (模型) based on phenomena. Whenever we articulate Zeroth Reality, the articulation itself becomes Second Reality. Capitalize \"Second Reality\" as technical term.\n\n---\n\n## 第〇实在 (di ling shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: Zeroth Reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"Ultimate Reality\" (as explanatory gloss, but loses structural numbering)\n  - \"Reality-Zero\" (more colloquial)\n  - \"ground reality\" (Buddhism)\n- **Note**: All experts agree on preserving the \"zeroth\" numbering. This is what traditional metaphysics calls 终极实在 (ultimate reality) -- the Dao, the Unmoved Mover, God, the thing-in-itself. The \"zeroth\" numbering is philosophically loaded: it designates a structural placeholder we can never reach from within the system. Whenever articulated, it becomes Second Reality. AVOID: \"non-reality\" or \"zero reality\" (suggests non-existence rather than inaccessibility). Capitalize \"Zeroth Reality.\"\n\n---\n\n## 实在 (shizai)\n\n- **Main translation**: reality\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the real\" (substantive)\n  - \"actuality\" (when emphasizing concrete existence)\n- **Note**: When used without numerical prefix, 实在 means \"reality\" in the ordinary sense, but the author's framework implies we must always ask: which reality? Use \"Reality\" with capital R when part of the numbered system. AVOID: \"substance\" or \"being.\"\n\n---\n\n## 清醒的梦境 (qingxing de mengjing)\n\n- **Main translation**: the lucid dreamscape\n- **Note**: The author's term for post-metaphysical, poetic existence. All experts agree \"lucid dreamscape\" perfectly captures the concept. Buddhism expert: parallels Chan awakening's third stage.\n\n---\n\n## 沉醉的梦境 (chenzui de mengjing)\n\n- **Main translation**: the intoxicated dreamscape\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - \"the unreflective dreamscape\"\n  - \"the absorbed dreamscape\"\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Phenomenology recommends \"absorbed\" over \"intoxicated\" (more neutral). Buddhism recommends \"intoxicated\" (preserves Buddhist resonance of *mada*). **Resolution recommendation**: Use \"intoxicated\" as main translation; translator's note that this is descriptive, not pejorative.\n\n---\n\n## 清醒 (qingxing)\n\n- **Main translation**: lucid\n- **Note**: All experts converge. AVOID: \"awakened\" (too specifically Buddhist); \"conscious\" (too Cartesian/neutral).\n\n---\n\n## 沉醉 (chenzui)\n\n- **Main translation**: intoxicated\n- **Alternatives**: \"absorbed\" (Phenomenology); \"immersed\" (when intoxication metaphor is too strong)\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Phenomenology: \"absorbed.\" Others: \"intoxicated.\" Resolution: \"intoxicated\" default; \"absorbed\" when context demands neutrality.\n\n---\n\n## 联想 (lianxiang)\n\n- **Main translation**: association\n- **Alternatives**: \"associative connection\"; \"cognitive morphism\" (Phil. of Mind, technical)\n- **Note**: All experts agree. Morphisms in E. Themselves experiences (tower structure).\n\n---\n\n## 超越 (chaoyue)\n\n- **Main translation**: transcendence (noun) / to transcend (verb)\n- **Note**: Multiple senses: failed quest for Zeroth Reality; what lies outside thought's boundary; immanent self-transformation. AVOID: \"transcendental\" unless discussing Kant.\n\n---\n\n## 超越性 (chaoyuexing)\n\n- **Main translation**: transcendence (as quality/property) / transcendent character\n- **Note**: Key usage: \"one's own death is transcendent for oneself.\" Critique of Heidegger's Being-toward-death.\n\n---\n\n## 虚无 (xuwu)\n\n- **Main translation**: nothingness / the void\n- **Alternatives**: \"nihility\" (formal contexts); AVOID \"emptiness\" (reserve for Buddhist 空)\n- **Note**: CRITICAL distinction from Buddhist 空. The void after the highest values collapse -- an absence, not a positive entity. NEVER translate as \"emptiness.\"\n\n---\n\n## 虚无主义 (xuwu zhuyi)\n\n- **Main translation**: nihilism\n- **Note**: Not a doctrine but a condition of meaning-loss.\n\n---\n\n## 后形而上学 (hou xing er shang xue)\n\n- **Main translation**: post-metaphysics\n- **Note**: \"After and transformed,\" not \"after and done with.\" AVOID: \"postmetaphysics\" (one word).\n\n---\n\n## 前形而上学 (qian xing er shang xue)\n\n- **Main translation**: pre-metaphysics\n- **Alternatives**: \"traditional metaphysics\"; \"pre-nihilist metaphysics\"\n\n---\n\n## 存在 (cunzai)\n\n- **Main translation**: existence / being / to exist\n- **Note**: Context-dependent. \"Being\" (capitalized) for Heidegger's *Sein*.\n\n---\n\n## 道 (dao)\n\n- **Main translation**: Dao (transliterated)\n- **Note**: GENERATED last through progressive generalization, not given first as primordial source.\n\n---\n\n## 德 (de)\n\n- **Main translation**: De (transliterated in philosophical passages); \"inherent character\" (when English gloss needed)\n- **Alternatives**: \"virtue\" (Confucian moral contexts only); \"efficacy\" / \"potency\" (Daoist contexts)\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Metaphysics: \"virtue/power/de.\" Chinese Philosophy: \"De/inherent character.\" Buddhism: \"virtue/potency.\" **Resolution**: \"De\" in philosophical passages about 道德仁义礼. \"Virtue\" only in Confucian moral contexts. \"Efficacy\" in Daoist contexts.\n\n---\n\n## 本质 (benzhi)\n\n- **Main translation**: essence / essential nature\n- **Note**: Reinterpreted as universal property of stable subcategory, not hidden inner nature.\n\n---\n\n## 构造 (gouzao)\n\n- **Main translation**: construction / to construct\n- **Alternatives**: \"constitution\" (Phenomenology, for Husserl's *Konstitution*); \"synthesis\" (Kantian)\n- **DISAGREEMENT**: Phenomenology recommends \"constitution.\" All others recommend \"construction.\" **Resolution**: \"Construction\" as default; \"constitution\" only in explicitly Husserlian contexts.\n\n---\n\n## 实践 (shijian)\n\n- **Main translation**: practice / praxis\n- **Note**: \"The overlap of ideal and phenomenon.\" Core of post-metaphysics.\n\n---\n\n## 我 (wo)\n\n- **Main translation**: I / self\n- **Note**: Category-theoretic definition: universal property (terminal object) of subcategory of experiences related to me. Non-substantialist.\n\n---\n\n## 自我 (ziwo)\n\n- **Main translation**: self (reflexive/philosophical)\n- **Note**: Distinguished from 我 by being reflexive/objectified.\n\n---\n\n## 自我实现 (ziwo shixian)\n\n- **Main translation**: self-realization\n- **Note**: \"Making the self become actual/real.\" AVOID \"self-actualization.\"\n\n---\n\n## 意义 (yiyi)\n\n- **Main translation**: meaning / significance\n- **Note**: Meaning and feeling are \"two sides of one body.\" Seeking meaning externally is the category error that generates absurdity.\n\n---\n\n## 理解 (lijie)\n\n- **Main translation**: understanding / to understand\n- **Note**: Formalized as natural transformation between functorial evolutions.\n\n---\n\n## 掌握 (zhangwo)\n\n- **Main translation**: mastery / to grasp\n- **Note**: Natural transformation component is the identity morphism.\n\n---\n\n## 知识 (zhishi)\n\n- **Main translation**: knowledge\n- **Note**: Author collapses JTB tripartite analysis.\n\n---\n\n## 信念 (xinnian)\n\n- **Main translation**: belief\n- **Note**: Central to the author's dissolution of JTB.\n\n---\n\n## 真理 (zhenli)\n\n- **Main translation**: truth\n- **Note**: Deflationary treatment. \"Inoperative\" in knowledge formation.\n\n---\n\n## 辩护 / 证成\n\n- **Main translation**: justification\n- **Note**: Reduces to belief in the author's system.\n\n---\n\n## 理性 (lixing)\n\n- **Main translation**: reason / rationality\n- **Note**: A tool whose purposes are non-rational.\n\n---\n\n## 先验 (xianyan)\n\n- **Main translation**: a priori / transcendental (context-dependent)\n- **Note**: Author's treatment is agnostic.

All others prefer \"construction.\"\n\n**Recommendation**: \"Construction\" as default; \"constitution\" only in Husserlian comparative passages.\n\n---\n\n### 6. 德 (de)\n\n| Expert | Main Recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Metaphysics | virtue / power / de |\n| Chinese Philosophy | De (romanized) / inherent character |\n| Buddhism | virtue / potency or efficacy |\n\n**Tension**: Radically different meanings across Confucian, Daoist, and authorial contexts.\n\n**Recommendation**: \"De\" (transliterated) in philosophical passages; context-specific translations elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n### 7. 虚无 (xuwu)\n\n| Expert | Main Recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Metaphysics | nothingness; the void |\n| Phenomenology | nothingness |\n| Epistemology | nihility / the void |\n| Existentialism | the void / nothingness |\n| Chinese Philosophy | the void / nothingness |\n| Buddhism | the void / emptiness-as-absence |\n\n**Tension**: Minor. Both \"nothingness\" and \"the void\" acceptable. Key consensus: NEVER use \"emptiness\" (reserved for Buddhist 空).\n\n**Recommendation**: Use \"nothingness\" or \"the void\" depending on context.\n\n---\n\n**End of Master Dictionary**\n\nThis document should be used as the authoritative reference for all translation decisions.

Here is a summary of what the Master Orchestrated Translation Dictionary contains, ready to be written once permissions are granted:\n\n**The complete dictionary covers 80+ unique terms across all 8 expert dictionaries, including:**\n\n**Tier 1 -- Core Terms (highest importance):**\n- 境 (Jing) -- consensus: transliterate as \"Jing\"\n- 现象 -- consensus: \"phenomena\"\n- 感受 -- consensus: \"feeling\" (DISAGREEMENT with Phil. of Mind)\n- 恒常 -- consensus: \"constancy\"\n- 诗意 -- consensus: \"the poetic\" (DISAGREEMENT with Buddhism)\n- 梦境 -- consensus: \"dreamscape\"\n- 非理性 -- consensus: \"the non-rational\" (NEVER \"irrational\")\n- 形而上 / 形而上学 -- \"the metaphysical\" vs \"metaphysics\" (discipline)\n- 第〇/第一/第二实在 -- \"Zeroth/First/Second Reality\"\n\n**7 Disagreements flagged for author resolution:**\n1. **感受**: \"feeling\" vs \"lived experience\" vs \"felt experience\"\n2. **诗意**: \"the poetic\" vs \"poeticality\" vs \"the Poetic\"\n3. **沉醉**: \"intoxicated\" vs \"absorbed\" vs \"immersed\"\n4. **境界**: \"boundary/horizon\" vs \"realm\"\n5. **构造**: \"construction\" vs \"constitution\"\n6. **德**: \"De\" vs \"virtue\" vs \"efficacy/potency\"\n7. **虚无**: \"nothingness\" vs \"the void\" (minor; NEVER \"emptiness\")\n\nThe full document is ready. Could you please grant write permissions so I can create the file at `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L.
