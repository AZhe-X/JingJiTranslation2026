Overall Assessment\n\nThe protocol is well-designed. It correctly prioritizes non-leading questions, experiential reporting over analytical summary, and staged delivery. The distinction between general post-essay prompts and the final experiential checks is exactly right. The delivery rule (\"Do NOT include this file in the reader's spawn prompt\") is essential and correct.\n\n### 2. Concern: Priming Risk in \"After Each Essay\" Questions\n\nThe question \"Did you feel like the essay was asking you to *experience* something rather than just understand an argument?\" risks priming the reader from Essay 1 onward to actively hunt for experiential sequences rather than simply having them. The Standby Reader profile already specifies \"experientially attentive\" as a Tier 1 trait, so this disposition is built in.\n\n**Recommendation**: Deliver that question only starting from Essay 4, or rephrase it for Essays 1-3 as: \"Was there anything you noticed about *how* this essay communicated its ideas?\"\n\n### 3. Critical Experiential Checks -- Assessment\n\n**Essay 3: \"What happened to your experience across the three examples?\"**\n- Well formulated and non-leading.\n- Minor concern: \"three examples\" is slightly ambiguous. The essay has four stages (Sisyphus, office worker, entrepreneur, cat owner). The entrepreneur is a pivot point, not a digression. Saying \"three\" may cause the reader to skip it in their report.\n- **Recommendation**: Rephrase to \"What happened to your experience as you moved through the essay's examples?\" (removes the count).\n\n**Essay 4: \"When the author walked through the hierarchy twice, what did you notice?\"**\n- Well designed for its target (the 道德仁义礼 reversal).\n- Minor concern: Essay 4 contains multiple hierarchies (Types 0-3 of metaphysics, the three realities, etc.). The reader may not immediately know which \"hierarchy\" is meant.\n- **Assessment**: This is fine if the translation makes the 道德仁义礼 passage sufficiently prominent and memorable, which it should -- it is the essay's most dramatic passage. No change needed.\n\n**Essay 7: \"When you encountered the two contrasting sentences, what was your experience?\"**\n- Well formulated and non-leading.\n- **Important note**: This check also tests the English meme-sentence substitution (mentioned in the Preface R3). A negative result could indicate either (a) the philosophical experiment doesn't work, or (b) the English substitute doesn't produce the intended structural position. The team should interpret the reader's response with this ambiguity in mind.\n\n### 4. Missing Check: Essay 1\n\nNo Critical Experiential Check for Essay 1. The essay has a specific experiential structure (the reader starts doubting collective interest exists, then experiences the renormalization analogy with ocean waves, and should arrive at recognition). The absence is acceptable -- the essay is more argumentative than experimental -- but I flag it for completeness.\n\n### 5. Missing Check: Collection-Level Experiential Shift\n\nThe \"After Completing the Full Collection\" questions probe the Part 1/Part 2 relationship intellectually but not experientially. The most important shift is the moment when Part 2's framework causes the reader to *re-experience* Part 1's essays differently.\n\n**Recommendation**: Add a targeted experiential check: \"Did reading Part 2 change what you *felt* when you recalled the essays from Part 1? If so, describe what changed.\"\n\n### 6. Preface Questions\n\nWell-calibrated for testing R3. No changes needed.\n\n### Summary of Recommendations\n\n1. Modify the experiential question in \"After Each Essay\" for Essays 1-3 to avoid priming.\n2. Essay 3 check: remove the count \"three\" -- say \"the essay's examples.\"\n3. Essay 7 check: note the dual-test nature (experiment + translation substitution).\n4. Add a collection-level experiential check about the Part 1 -> Part 2 felt shift.\n5. No changes needed for Essay 4 check or Final Prompts.\n\nI approve the protocol with or without these modifications.","summary":"Forwarding Reporting Protocol feedback for synthesis"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":327,"cache_read_input_tokens":107321,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":327},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY1zYJ3WUqvAfhS49XcpR","type":"assistant","uuid":"191eb999-fad3-4660-ae42-494ff3389ae1","timestamp":"2026-02-11T08:49:01.429Z"}
