Here is the actual proposal from the author:\n\nThe main translations STAY as they are:\n- 第〇实在 → **Zeroth Reality**\n- 第一实在 → **First Reality**\n- 第二实在 → **Second Reality**\n\nBut each would get a **translator's note (TN)** with an interpretive gloss:\n- Zeroth Reality (TN: \"Ultimate Reality\")\n- First Reality (TN: \"Primary Reality\")\n- Second Reality (TN: \"Secondary Reality\")\n\nSo the ordinal names are preserved in the main text. The TNs just provide the reader with an additional interpretive handle.\n\nIs this a good idea? Do these TN glosses help the reader, or do they introduce the same problems (ontological weight for \"Ultimate,\" evaluative connotation for \"Secondary\") even when relegated to a footnote? Keep your response concise.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"344c88ff-b9b8-4923-9739-d05c3f737288","timestamp":"2026-02-10T23:29:44.836Z"}
