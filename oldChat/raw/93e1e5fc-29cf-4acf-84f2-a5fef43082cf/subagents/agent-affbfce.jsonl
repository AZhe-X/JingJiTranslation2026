Buddhism (Madhyamaka, Yogacara, Chan/Zen)\n\nQuestion for each of you: Given the essays you've read, is there a significant expert perspective MISSING from this team? Or do you think these 8 cover the ground adequately? \n\nThink about: Are there terms, arguments, or frameworks in the essays that none of us are well-equipped to handle?
