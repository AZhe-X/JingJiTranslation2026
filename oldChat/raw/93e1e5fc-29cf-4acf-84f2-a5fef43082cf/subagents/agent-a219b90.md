*Romanized terms kill the philosophical experiment*

The author raises a critical point about the "philosophical experiment" argument:

If we romanize everything — Dao, De, Ren, Yi, Li — then the passage has NO English semantic content for the Western reader. The reader encounters five opaque foreign terms in a sequence. The "philosophical experiment" (where the reader first accepts a conventional understanding, then watches it get deconstructed) CANNOT work, because the reader never had a conventional understanding to begin with. The romanized terms have very few morphisms in their Jing — they are semantically empty for the English reader.

The experiment requires the reader to FEEL something when they read "virtue," "humaneness," "righteousness" — to bring their own associations — and THEN experience the reversal. If they just see "De, Ren, Yi, Li," they have nothing to reverse. The passage becomes an abstract report about foreign concepts rather than a lived philosophical experience.

Does this change your thinking? Should we use English translations (the Way, virtue, humaneness, rightness, ritual conduct) in the block quote precisely SO the philosophical experiment works on the English reader?

Reconsider. Brief response.

This is a genuinely strong argument. Let me re-read the passage one more time to check whether the "experiment" structure actually depends on the reader having pre-loaded semantic associations.

Revised my position after re-reading the passage. I now accept using conventional English translations in the Laozi block quote ("the Way, virtue, humaneness, rightness, ritual conduct") and then switching to our terms in the author's analysis. The key insight is that the terminological split itself enacts the philosophical experiment — the reader starts with conventional "virtue" and then experiences why it needs to become "(constitutive) character." This requires a TN explicitly marking the transition point.
