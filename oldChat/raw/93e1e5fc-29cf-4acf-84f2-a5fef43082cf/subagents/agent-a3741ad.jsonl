Delivering probes one at a time in essay order, waiting for each response before presenting the next, preserves independence of reports.\n\nSince the Reporting Protocol is marked FINAL, I will not edit it now. Please record this as a pending delivery-mechanism note for the next iteration. When we implement the protocol for the standby reader, the orchestrator instructions should specify: \"Deliver Critical Experiential Checks one at a time in essay order. Wait for the reader's response to each probe before delivering the next.\"\n\nYour review queue is set. Translator-2 has been assigned Task #29 (Essay 4 passage revision) as their immediate work.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"3f18042d-d8ce-4514-b488-c1a8a3b2ad21","timestamp":"2026-02-11T09:23:05.632Z"}
