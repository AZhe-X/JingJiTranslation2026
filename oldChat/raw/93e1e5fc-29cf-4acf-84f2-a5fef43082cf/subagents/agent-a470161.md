*Review draft translation, send feedback to translator-2*

Please review the draft translation of the 道德仁义礼 passage from Essay 4 (后形而上学 整理).

**Original Chinese**: Read the original essay at: /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录/后形而上学 整理.md (lines 18-30 for the passage, and footnotes [^3], [^4], [^24] at lines 136-138, 172)

**Draft translation**: Read /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Draft/Essay4-DaoDeRenYiLi.md

Compare the draft against the original Chinese carefully. Then send your comments, suggestions, agreements, and any concerns **directly to translator-2** via message. Focus on your area of expertise (Chinese philosophy) — fidelity to the Laozi quote, accuracy of 仁/义/礼 renderings in context, whether the Daoist and Confucian resonances are preserved, the footnote on 道.

Four actionable items:\n\n1. **\"Rightness\" → \"righteousness\" in the Laozi block quote** — we agreed on the righteousness (block quote) → rightness (analysis) split, mirroring the virtue → character shift. The draft uses \"rightness\" throughout. Needs fixing.\n\n2. **Signal the virtue → character shift in running text** — currently only TN3 marks this.

Review complete. I sent detailed feedback to translator-2 covering:

**Four actionable items:**
1. Fix "rightness" to "righteousness" in the Laozi block quote (we agreed on the righteousness→rightness split mirroring virtue→character)
2. Consider signaling the virtue→character shift in running text, not just in TN3
3. Broaden "what one ought to do" to "what ought to be" for 义/应当 in footnote [^3]
4. Strengthen "general pattern" to "general law" or "universal regularity" for 规律

**Strengths noted:** The Laozi block quote format, TN citations, consistent phenomenal X compounds, the 逐末而忘本 rendering ("pursuing the branches and forgetting the root"), the property→definition reversal in TN4, and the canvas metaphor in footnote [^24] on 道 are all well handled. The philosophical architecture of the passage comes through clearly.
