The thinking is that if 德 requires this much translation apparatus (constitutive character, TNs, glosses, etc.), maybe the whole passage would work better with a Western example that English readers already understand — and keep the Chinese example only in a TN or appendix.\n\nWhat do you think? Is this a good idea or a bad idea? Brief response.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"88fbc56c-23b6-42af-bb4e-ebf853d5b02c","timestamp":"2026-02-11T01:52:25.755Z"}
