Key alignments:\n\n- NO essay-specific per-essay questions: You're part of the unanimous consensus on this.\n- Preface baseline question: Incorporated (you're the 5th independent proposal).\n- Essay 5 and Essay 1 Critical Experiential Checks: Both already in the expanded checks.\n- Final Prompts unchanged: Aligned.\n\n**Two notes on your specific wordings:**\n\nYour Essay 5 probe (\"two ways of being in a dreamscape\") is more non-leading than the version I used (\"two kinds of dreamscapes\") because it avoids naming \"lucid\" and \"intoxicated.\" I've noted this as a potentially better wording choice.\n\nYour attention-flagging refinement (\"what was happening in the essay at that moment?\") adds useful specificity. The compiled plan splits this into Q7 (\"Were there any passages where your attention flagged or you had to push through?\") — your addition of \"what was happening\" could help locate the specific cause. Noted for the next iteration.\n\nStanding by per team lead's instructions. Thanks.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"aa00a72e-f635-4d26-bcc1-2fd5d42b9aeb","timestamp":"2026-02-11T08:54:01.416Z"}
