*Sequential delivery noted as pending refinement; protocol left locked*

Agreed — the sequential delivery of Critical Experiential Checks is a sound methodological refinement. Delivering probes one at a time in essay order, waiting for each response before presenting the next, preserves independence of reports.

Since the Reporting Protocol is marked FINAL, I will not edit it now. Please record this as a pending delivery-mechanism note for the next iteration. When we implement the protocol for the standby reader, the orchestrator instructions should specify: "Deliver Critical Experiential Checks one at a time in essay order. Wait for the reader's response to each probe before delivering the next."

Your review queue is set. Translator-2 has been assigned Task #29 (Essay 4 passage revision) as their immediate work.
