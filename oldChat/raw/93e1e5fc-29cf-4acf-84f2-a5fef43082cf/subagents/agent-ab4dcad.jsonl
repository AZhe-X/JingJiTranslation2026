Original 文言 preserved, glossed English with (漢字, *pinyin*) on first occurrence, attribution to Daodejing Ch. 38. TN1 citing Ivanhoe and explaining departures is exactly right.\n\n2. **The 德 transition** — TN3 handles the virtue → (constitutive) character shift cleanly. The phrase \"assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle\" is a precise and elegant gloss of the author's position.\n\n3. **TN4 on the property→definition reversal** — This is the conceptual heart of the passage and it is drawn out clearly. Good editorial judgment to give it its own TN.\n\n4. **\"Phenomenal X\" compounds** — Consistently rendered throughout. No slippage.\n\n5. **Footnote [^24] on 道** — The canvas metaphor is preserved and the structural qualification is clear.\n\n6. **\"逐末而忘本\" → \"pursuing the branches and forgetting the root\"** — Preserves the classical Chinese metaphor (末 = branches/tips, 本 = root/foundation) while being immediately legible in English. Well done.\n\n7. **\"规范\" → \"norm\"** at line 46 — Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**CONCERNS AND SUGGESTIONS (4 actionable items):**\n\n**1. \"Rightness\" still appears in the block quote (line 34) — NEEDS FIX.**\n\nWe decided: \"righteousness\" in the block quote (loaded, conventional) → \"rightness\" in the author's analysis (deflated, reconceptualized). This mirrors the virtue → character shift. But the draft uses \"rightness\" everywhere, including the block quote. Line 34 should read:\n\n> \"...when humaneness was lost, there was righteousness (义, *yi*); when righteousness was lost, there was ritual conduct (礼, *li*).\"\n\nThen in the author's analysis (starting line 38), shift to \"rightness.\" TN1 already notes our departure from standard translations — it should also note the righteousness → rightness shift and explain why (the author treats 义 as motivational disposition rather than moral judgment).\n\n**2. Line 40: Consider signaling the virtue → character shift in running text, not just TN3.**\n\nOriginal: \"我们便把我们认为（应当是）人人皆而有之的东西，在这里便是'现象仁'，称之为'德'\"\n\nDraft: \"we take what we believe (ought to be) universally possessed — here, phenomenal humaneness — and call it 'character.'\"\n\nThis is correct, but the shift from \"virtue\" (block quote) to \"character\" (analysis) happens without explicit marking in the text itself. TN3 is attached, which helps. But consider adding a brief in-text signal:\n\n\"...and call it 'character' (德, *de*) — what appeared as 'virtue' in the classical formulation.\"\n\nThis makes the reconceptualization visible for readers who skip footnotes. Optional — TN3 does the work — but it would strengthen the philosophical experience.\n\n**3. Footnote [^3]: \"what ought to be\" rather than \"what one ought to do\" for 义/应当.**\n\nOriginal: \"所谓义，是谓应当\"\n\nThe draft renders this as \"what one ought to do.\" But 应当 is just \"ought\" or \"what ought to be\" — broader than \"what one ought to do\" (which implies action). 义 in this context is the *sense of what ought to be*, which then becomes the motivational bridge to action. Suggested: \"rightness (义) is said to be *what ought to be*\" — preserving the broader scope before the author narrows it to motivation in the following sentences.\n\n**4. Line 44: \"general pattern\" → consider \"general law\" or \"universal regularity\" for 规律.**\n\nOriginal: \"德是一种一般的规律，因为凡事诸物皆有其德（我们认为他应该遵守的规律，使得一样东西成为其本身的东西）\"\n\n\"General pattern\" is acceptable for 一般的规律, but \"pattern\" may be too weak. 规律 means \"law, regularity, pattern\" — it carries normative force. The parenthetical says \"the pattern we take them to *follow*\" (应该遵守的规律), which implies something more binding than a pattern. Consider \"general law\" or \"universal regularity\" to convey that 德 is not just a pattern we observe but a regularity we take things to follow.\n\n---\n\n**ADDITIONAL NOTES (lower priority):**\n\n- **Footnote [^3], 爱人:** \"Loving others\" is fine, but a parenthetical \"(cf. Analects 12.22)\" would anchor the reference for scholarly readers. Minor.\n\n- **TN2 on 形/形而上 and the Xici zhuan:** Good inclusion. But the author also addresses this in the appendix (lines 88-94 of the original). When the full essay is translated, make sure TN2 does not duplicate the appendix. May need shortening later.\n\n- **Line 36 (形/形而上 structure):** We agreed no TN is needed here because the preceding paragraph explains it. That paragraph is not in this excerpt.
