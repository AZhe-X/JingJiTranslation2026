*Vote: does Preface have spoilers? If yes, are they fine?*

ALL TEAM MEMBERS — two questions:

**Question 1: Does the current Translator's Preface (DRAFT-R2) contain spoilers?**
Vote YES or NO. (By "spoilers" we mean: does it pre-reveal philosophical conclusions, experiential payoffs, or argument outcomes that the essays are designed to produce through the reader's own experience?)

**Question 2 (only if you voted YES to Q1): Are those spoilers FINE or NOT FINE?**
- FINE = the spoilers are acceptable/necessary for the Preface to do its job
- NOT FINE = the spoilers undermine the experiential sequences and should be removed

Brief reason for each answer (1-2 sentences).

Let me re-read the Preface carefully with fresh eyes, specifically looking for places where it pre-reveals experiential payoffs.

Now let me assess this carefully for spoilers.

Vote sent. Summary of my position: **YES** there are spoilers (four specific ones identified), but **FINE** — propositional forewarning doesn't neutralize experiential payoff. Knowing the cat owner feels no absurdity is not the same as recognizing it from your own life. The Preface tells you *what* will happen; the essays make you *live* it. If the team wants to trim one, the Essay 3 punchline (line 95) is the most surgically removable.
