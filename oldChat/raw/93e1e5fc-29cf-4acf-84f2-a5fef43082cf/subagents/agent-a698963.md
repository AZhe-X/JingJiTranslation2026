*Debate 感受 translation — load all essays, find occurrences*

**DEBATE REQUEST: 感受 (gǎnshòu) and related terms (经验, etc.)**

We need to resolve Disagreement #1: how to translate 感受. Current split: "feeling" (simpler) vs "lived experience"/"phenomenal experience" (more precise) vs "felt experience" (compromise).

**Your task:**

1. **Load all 8+1 essays** into your context. The essay files are at `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/`. The 境集 essays are:

   **上集:**
   - `22 随笔/关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一.md`
   - `23 Reflection/A Thought on Knowledge.md`
   - `22 随笔/西西弗斯、班与猫.md`

   **下集:**
   - `21 无知者的自我记录/后形而上学 整理.md`
   - `21 无知者的自我记录/形而上学后的目的：诗意.md`
   - `21 无知者的自我记录/范畴论与境.md`
   - `21 无知者的自我记录/范畴论与境：K1策略.md`

   **附录:**
   - `21 无知者的自我记录/关于诗意和境的一些零散想法.md`

   **Draft (+1):**
   - `21 无知者的自我记录/后形而上学 其一.md`

2. **Search all essays for 感受 and related terms** (经验, 体验, 感觉, 感知, etc.). Note every occurrence with line numbers.

3. **Analyze how the author uses these terms** — are they interchangeable? Does the author distinguish them? What philosophical work does each do?

4. **Send your analysis and recommendation to team-lead.** Include:
   - Where 感受 appears and in what sense
   - Where related terms (经验, etc.) appear and how they differ from 感受
   - Your recommended English translation(s) for 感受, with reasoning from your area of expertise
   - Whether different contexts need different renderings

This is a debate — you will see others' positions and can respond. Be specific, cite the texts.

Let me systematically search all essays for 感受 and related terms.

Now let me read the key definitional passages more closely -- especially the author's own explicit definitions.

Now let me read the key occurrences in the Essay 4 passage itself and the 集体利益 essay.

Now I have a comprehensive picture. Let me compile my analysis and send it to the team lead.

Full analysis sent to team-lead. Here is a summary of my findings and recommendation:

**Key findings from the corpus search:**

1. **感受** is the author's foundational ontological term. It is explicitly defined (范畴论与境 line 166) as "any part of phenomena," with the totality of 感受 equaling phenomena itself. It is NOT merely "feeling" in the emotional sense -- it encompasses mathematical understanding, the self, and all phenomenal content.

2. **The author distinguishes two senses** of 感受 (诗意 fn [^2]): raw sensation (input) and constituted wholes (crystallizations, surges). The default usage is the second, broader sense.

3. **体验** is explicitly equated with 感受 but in practice emphasizes the processual/active dimension (undergoing).

4. **感觉** is rarer and leans toward immediate sensation/impression.

5. **经验** is categorically different -- it means "experience" in the epistemological/empirical sense and must NEVER be conflated with 感受.

**My recommendation: "felt experience"** as the default rendering for 感受, with "feeling" permitted in explicitly affective contexts like the Essay 4 现象仁 passage. This avoids the narrowness of "feeling," the Husserlian baggage of "lived experience," and the redundancy of "phenomenal experience."
