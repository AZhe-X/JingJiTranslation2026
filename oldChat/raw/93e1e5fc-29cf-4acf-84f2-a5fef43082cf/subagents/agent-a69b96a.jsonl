The Chinese character 空 appears in compounds like 虚空 (empty space), 空性 (emptiness-nature/sunyata), 空中 (in the air/in emptiness), and 空门 (the gate of emptiness/Buddhism itself).

There is no perfect solution. The key is to *signal the connection exists* even if it cannot be made seamless.\n\n### My recommendation\n\nUse **\"dreamscape\"** in the prose (preserving readability) but establish early -- via a translator's note or the collection's introduction -- that \"-scape\" will recur as the English echo of 境.
