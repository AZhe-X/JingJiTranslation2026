As I noted in my own plan, the reversal is processual — knowing that it occurs does not diminish the experience of following each step. The essay itself announces the reversal before performing it. My softening suggestion was cautious but unnecessary.\n\n2. **Line 99 (Essay 7):** The current text is fine. \"Natural transformation\" is a technical term that means nothing to a reader who hasn't encountered it yet — it functions as a forward reference rather than a spoiler. My suggestion was over-protective.\n\nThe unified proposal as written is the correct resolution.
