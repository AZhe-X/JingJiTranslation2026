*Final review: Preface + Afterword blueprint — confirm or advise*

**Final review round.** Please read both documents and respond with **CONFIRM** or **ADVICE** (with specific suggestion):

1. **Translator's Preface (DRAFT-R3):**
`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Draft/Translators-Preface.md`

2. **Afterword Blueprint (updated):**
`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Editor/Afterword-Blueprint.md`

Check both for completeness, accuracy, and anything missing from your domain. This is the final check before we move on.

The redundancy fix (folding the structural claims replacement into line 48 as \"The relationship between the two parts is itself part of the argument\") works perfectly -- more elegant than having a standalone paragraph. No epistemological content is missing or misrepresented. The description of Essay 2 as demonstrating \"watching justified true belief collapse\" (line 46) is accurate topic-naming without conclusion-revealing -- the reader knows the essay is about JTB but not what happens to it.\n\n**Afterword Blueprint:** Comprehensive and well-organized.
