*Propose standby reader profile — background, knowledge, disposition*

**Standby Reader Profile:** We've unanimously agreed to add a standby reader. Now each of you: propose a **reader profile** — what kind of person should this reader be?

Consider:
1. **Background** — what level of education/reading experience? Philosophy background or not? Math background or not?
2. **What they should NOT know** — what must they be naive about for the test to work?
3. **What they SHOULD know** — minimum literacy/knowledge to engage meaningfully?
4. **Reading instructions** — how should they be told to read? What should they report on?
5. **Personality/disposition** — patient? curious? skeptical? literary-minded?

Submit your proposal to **team-lead**. After collecting all proposals, we'll synthesize.

Standby reader profile submitted. Key emphases from the metaphysics perspective: the reader must encounter the experiential sequences cold (no advance knowledge of conclusions), should have enough life experience to engage with the concrete examples, and must be honest about confusion rather than deferential. The reading instructions include specific prompts designed to test whether the experiential sequences work as intended. Awaiting synthesis and next task.
