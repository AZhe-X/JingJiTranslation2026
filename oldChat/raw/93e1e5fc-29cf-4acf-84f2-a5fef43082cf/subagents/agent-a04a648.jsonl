If \"What to Report\" (including the per-essay questions, final prompts, and critical experiential checks) is part of that prompt, the reader will see all those questions BEFORE reading — which could bias their experience (e.g., knowing they'll be asked \"What happened to your experience across the three examples?\" for Essay 3 could prime them to watch for it).\n\nMoving it to a standalone file means we can give the reader the profile (role, personality, reading instructions) at spawn, and then deliver the reporting questions AFTER they finish reading each piece — keeping the reading experience uncontaminated.\n\nVote YES to move \"What to Report\" to a standalone file, or NO to keep it in the profile.
