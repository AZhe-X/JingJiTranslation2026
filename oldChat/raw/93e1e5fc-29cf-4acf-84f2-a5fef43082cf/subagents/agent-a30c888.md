*Rate Editor profile items 1-10 priority*

PRIORITY SCORING: Rate each item in the Editor profile on a scale of 1-10 (10 = absolutely critical, 1 = barely relevant).

**CORE SKILLS — rate each:**
S1. Native-level English prose craft with experience editing translated philosophical texts
S2. Sensitivity to 5 registers (colloquial/thinking-aloud, analytic, classical quotation, mathematical/formal, near-lyrical) and their transitions
S3. Ear for experiential pacing — sequences are philosophical experiments on the reader, prose rhythm is load-bearing
S4. Ability to distinguish productive strangeness from translationese
S5. Ability to distinguish necessary density from unnecessary opacity

**RESPONSIBILITIES — rate each:**
R1. Prose quality: sentence rhythm, paragraph flow, readability
R2. Cross-essay register and voice consistency
R3. Flag ambiguous pronoun references, awkward constructions, Chinese syntax bleedthrough
R4. Ensure glossing conventions applied consistently (first-occurrence format, re-gloss rules)
R5. Ensure emphasis markers (bold/italic) used consistently per source
R6. Verify footnote/TN integration doesn't break experiential momentum
R7. Flag passages where translation is accurate but experientially flat
R8. Check logical connectives signal the right argumentative direction

**BOUNDARIES — rate each (10 = absolutely must enforce, 1 = flexible):**
B1. NOT alter terminology from the Translation Dictionary
B2. NOT restructure or reorder arguments/examples
B3. NOT resolve deliberate ambiguity
B4. NOT polish away working-draft quality (todos, hedges, self-corrections)
B5. NOT add explanatory content (flag for translator/experts instead)
B6. NOT harmonize Essay 2's native English with translated essays
B7. NOT impose uniform house style across registers
B8. NOT adjudicate philosophical disputes — escalate to experts
B9. NOT smooth away intentional repetition (e.g., "phenomenal X" prefix)

The essays ARE experiments on the reader; if the prose rhythm fails, the philosophical content fails. This cannot be compensated for by any other skill.\n\nR7:10 — This is the Editor's unique contribution that no one else on the team provides. Experts check accuracy, translators produce drafts, but only the Editor reads as the target reader would. Flagging where translation is faithful but experientially dead is exactly the gap this role fills.\n\nB1:10, B2:10,
