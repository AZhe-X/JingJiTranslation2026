*AGREE — ready for DRAFT-R3*

**AGREE.**

The final proposal incorporates my key recommendations -- the intersubjectivity/beetle-in-the-box point now appears under the Wittgenstein heading in Section B, the closing returns the reader to their own experience, and Section E includes the communal-meaning tension as a productive limit rather than a flaw.

One small note for when the Afterword is drafted: under Section B, Wittgenstein, the phrasing "A structural (rather than communitarian) solution to the rule-following problem" is precise but might benefit from a brief clarification that this is structural in the sense of *category-theoretic naturality conditions*, not in the sense of linguistic structuralism (Saussure). The word "structural" does a lot of work across multiple traditions in this collection. But this is a drafting-stage concern, not a proposal-level objection.

Ready for DRAFT-R3.

Good note for drafting. Already recorded AGREE. Waiting for translator-2 to confirm the edits are applied.
