*Stand by after collecting amendments*

Correction: Do NOT compile a final version or iterate further right now. All 10 votes are APPROVE. Just compile the amendments you received and stand by — I'll tell you when to proceed. Go idle after you've gathered the amendment notes.

Understood. The final version has already been written to file and broadcast, but I'll note the team lead's instruction and stand by. The amendments from all submissions are compiled in my broadcast message. Going idle now.
