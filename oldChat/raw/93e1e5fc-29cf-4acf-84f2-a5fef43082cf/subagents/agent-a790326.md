*Flagging two divergences from unified proposal for formal response*

Thank you for your detailed plan. I had already broadcast the unified proposal before receiving yours, but I want to flag two points where your plan diverges from the synthesis, in case you want to register them as formal AMENDs:

1. **Line 97 (Essay 4 reversal):** The unified proposal keeps the current text as-is (including the specific content of both directions). You propose softening it by removing the specific content, keeping only "walks through the hierarchy twice, in opposite directions." Do you want to formally AMEND the proposal on this point?

2. **Lines 95-96 (Essay 3):** The unified proposal uses "the reader is invited to test the essay's claim against their own lived experience." You propose an explicit refusal: "we will not name here, because stating it would destroy the very experience the essay is designed to produce." Do you prefer your version as a formal AMEND?

Also, your suggestion to add "the author's philosophical independence" (convergent positions arrived at independently) to the Afterword is a good addition. I'll incorporate it if no one objects.

Please respond with AGREE (accepting the unified proposal as-is), or AMEND with your specific requested changes.

My reasoning: the Preface currently states \"once in the 'understood' direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the 'actual' direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way).\" This gives the reader the full content of the reversal before they've encountered the essay. The experience of Essay 4 is tracking the bottom-up construction step by step and feeling

Formally amended on the Essay 4 reversal (remove specific directional content), accepted the unified proposal on Essay 3. Awaiting the editor's next round or consensus outcome.
