Identify: (1) parallels between the author's framework and Kant's critical philosophy (phenomena/noumena, synthetic a priori, conditions of possibility), (2) how S_E might relate to Kantian categories/forms of intuition, (3) the author's explicit acknowledgment of the Kantian parallel in the appendix, (4) translation challenges for transcendental terms, (5) where the framework diverges from Kant. Focus especially on 后形而上学 整理, K1策略, and 关于诗意和境的一些零散想法.","assignedBy":"kantian-expert","timestamp":"2026-02-10T17:17:14.585Z"}

This task assignment message appears to be a duplicate/echo of the task I have already completed. Task #6 was already finished -- I read all 8 essays, wrote the comprehensive Kantian analysis, sent it to the team lead, and saved the full report to:

`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Kantian/Analysis Report.md`

Let me verify the task status is still correct.

[tool: TaskGet]
{
  "taskId": "6"
}

Confirmed -- Task #6 is already completed. I also see there is a Task #13 marked as in_progress and assigned to kantian-expert. Let me check what that is.

[tool: TaskGet]
{
  "taskId": "13"
}

Task #13 appears to be a duplicate task entry that was auto-created. Since the actual work is fully done (Task #6 completed, report written and saved, team lead notified), let me mark #13 as completed as well.

[tool: TaskUpdate]
{
  "taskId": "13",
  "status": "completed"
}

Both tasks are now marked completed. The full Kantian analysis has been delivered and saved. No further action is needed on my part unless new tasks are assigned.
