The draft has been refined since my earlier review. All my prior concerns are addressed — "derived from" replaces "summarized from," "paper" replaces "canvas" for 画纸 fidelity, and the existential architecture is fully intact.

{
  "type": "message",
  "recipient": "team-lead",
  "content": "**CONFIRM**\n\nThe draft preserves the existential architecture of the passage — the concealment of origins (掩埋不见 → \"buried from view\"), the structural forgetting (逐末而忘本 → \"pursuing the branches and forgetting the root\"), the cascading loss (层层下跌), and the reversal from contingent property to imposed definition. The 失 echo between the Laozi quote and the conclusion is intact. All revisions since my earlier review (derived from, paper, imposed, regularity) are improvements. No objections.",
  "summary": "CONFIRM — no objections, draft approved"
