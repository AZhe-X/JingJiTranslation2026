The multi-stage delivery structure (general first, targeted after) and the non-leading question principle are exactly right. The \"After Each Essay\" template (lines 28-32) is good -- those five questions capture what we need without priming.\n\n### On the team-lead's suggestion: essay-specific questions\n\n**My recommendation: do NOT add essay-specific questions alongside the general per-essay template.** Here's why:\n\nThe general template already includes \"Was there a moment where something clicked or shifted for you?\" and \"Did you feel like the essay was asking you to experience something?\" These are open-ended enough to capture essay-specific effects without naming them. If we add a tailored question after Essay 1 like \"Did you find the ocean/wave analogy convincing?\" or after Essay 4 like \"How did you experience the hierarchy analysis?\", we are telling the reader what to attend to, which biases their report and undermines the experimental conditions.\n\nThe essay-specific probing is already handled by the Critical Experiential Checks at the end (lines 57-65), which are delivered after the reader has already reported their general experience. That's the right place for targeted follow-up -- retroactive probing after unprompted reporting.\n\n**One exception I would consider:** After Essays 6 and 7 specifically, the question \"Did the mathematical passages help, hinder, or not affect your understanding? Did the examples carry the content on their own?\" is already in the collection-level report (line 42). But it would be more useful to ask this immediately after each essay while the experience is fresh, rather than retrospectively. I would add to the general per-essay template for Essays 6 and 7 only:\n\n> \"Were there passages where the notation felt like a barrier? If so, did the examples nearby help you through?\"\n\nThis is safe because it does not prime for any philosophical content -- it asks about the reading experience of formalism, which the reader will have already noticed. It is a question about accessibility, not about philosophical conclusions.\n\n### Specific feedback on existing content\n\n**Lines 28-32 (After Each Essay):** Strong. I would add one question:\n\n> \"Did anything in this essay remind you of something from your own life or experience?\"\n\nThis tests whether the experiential sequences make contact with the reader's own Jing without telling them what kind of contact to expect. It is especially important for Essays 1 (collective interest as emergent), 3 (the cat example), and 5 (the dreamscape concept), where the philosophical point depends on the reader recognizing something they already know.\n\n**Lines 40-43 (After Full Collection):** Good. I would add:\n\n> \"Did the Preface prepare you well? Looking back, was there anything it told you that you wish you'd discovered on your own, or anything it didn't tell you that would have helped?\"\n\nThis gives us direct feedback on whether the spoiler resolution worked from the reader's perspective.\n\n**Lines 51-53 (Final Prompts):** The \"tell a friend\" prompt is excellent (I voted YES for it). The second prompt (\"What would you tell a friend it's *like* to read?\") is a smart addition -- it separates content from experience. The recommendation question is useful for gauging overall engagement.\n\n**Lines 61-63 (Critical Experiential Checks):** Well-formulated and properly non-leading. I would add one more:\n\n> Essay 5: \"When the author described the two kinds of dreamscapes, what came to mind?\"\n\nThe intoxicated/lucid distinction is the philosophical heart of the 诗意 essay and one of the collection's central contributions. If the reader did not register this distinction experientially, that is important data. The question is non-leading -- it asks what came to mind, not whether they agreed or felt anything specific.\n\n### Summary of proposed additions\n\n1. Add to general per-essay template: \"Did anything in this essay remind you of something from your own life or experience?\"\n2. Add to Essays 6-7 only: \"Were there passages where the notation felt like a barrier? If so, did the examples nearby help you through?\"\n3. Add to After Full Collection: \"Did the Preface prepare you well? Looking back, was there anything it told you that you wish you'd discovered on your own, or anything it didn't tell you that would have helped?\"\n4. Add to Critical Experiential Checks: Essay 5 — \"When the author described the two kinds of dreamscapes, what came to mind?\"\n5. Do NOT add essay-specific questions to the per-essay template beyond what's already there.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"9b02509e-7c67-4991-84da-f6f31c35c84a","timestamp":"2026-02-11T08:50:26.246Z"}

It doesn't prime for later essays because formalism only appears in Essays 6-7.\n\n3. **Preface retrospective question** — Good addition to the \"After Full Collection\" section.
