Native-level English prose craft with experience editing translated philosophical texts\nS2. Sensitivity to 5 registers (colloquial/thinking-aloud, analytic, classical quotation, mathematical/formal, near-lyrical) and their transitions\nS3. Ear for experiential pacing — sequences are philosophical experiments on the reader, prose rhythm is load-bearing\nS4. Ability to distinguish productive strangeness from translationese\nS5. Ability to distinguish necessary density from unnecessary opacity\n\n**RESPONSIBILITIES — rate each:**\nR1. Prose quality: sentence rhythm, paragraph flow, readability\nR2. Cross-essay register and voice consistency\nR3. Flag ambiguous pronoun references, awkward constructions, Chinese syntax bleedthrough\nR4. Ensure glossing conventions applied consistently (first-occurrence format, re-gloss rules)\nR5. Ensure emphasis markers (bold/italic) used consistently per source\nR6. Verify footnote/TN integration doesn't break experiential momentum\nR7. Flag passages where translation is accurate but experientially flat\nR8. Check logical connectives signal the right argumentative direction\n\n**BOUNDARIES — rate each (10 = absolutely must enforce, 1 = flexible):**\nB1. NOT alter terminology from the Translation Dictionary\nB2. NOT restructure or reorder arguments/examples\nB3. NOT resolve deliberate ambiguity\nB4. NOT polish away working-draft quality (todos, hedges, self-corrections)\nB5. NOT add explanatory content (flag for translator/experts instead)\nB6. NOT harmonize Essay 2's native English with translated essays\nB7. NOT impose uniform house style across registers\nB8. NOT adjudicate philosophical disputes — escalate to experts\nB9. NOT smooth away intentional repetition (e.g., \"phenomenal X\" prefix)\n\nReply in this format:\nS1:[score] S2:[score] S3:[score] S4:[score] S5:[score]\nR1:[score] R2:[score] R3:[score] R4:[score] R5:[score] R6:[score] R7:[score] R8:[score]\nB1:[score] B2:[score] B3:[score] B4:[score] B5:[score] B6:[score] B7:[score] B8:[score] B9:[score]\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"39d250fb-c95a-4edf-be2b-b1f5969b77b2","timestamp":"2026-02-11T05:16:36.230Z"}
