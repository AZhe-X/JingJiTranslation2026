*Review Reporting-Protocol, send feedback to editor*

Task: Review the Reporting-Protocol.md (in Standby Reader directory) and send your advice, suggestions, or confirmation to **editor**. 

The file is at: `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Standby Reader/Reporting-Protocol.md`

Read the file, then send your feedback directly to **editor** (not to me). Editor will orchestrate everyone's suggestions and discuss back and forth until a plan is agreed. Use your own judgment throughout.

One suggestion from the project lead to consider: **Should we add essay-specific questions alongside the general per-essay questions?** For example, after Essay 1 we might ask something tailored to what Essay 1 does, after Essay 2 something tailored to Essay 2, etc. — not just the same generic template for every essay. Think about whether this would be valuable, what those questions might look like, and whether they risk priming the reader (the same concern that led us to extract this file in the first place).

Send your feedback to **editor** when ready.

Let me read the Reporting Protocol file first, then also refresh my memory on the Standby Reader Profile to understand the full context.

Good. Now let me think carefully about this before sending my feedback to the editor. The team lead's specific question is whether we should add essay-specific questions alongside the generic per-essay template, and the tension is between diagnostic value and priming risk. Let me also review my Memo to recall which experiential sequences in which essays are most critical to test.

Feedback sent to the editor (translator). Here's what I covered:

**7 specific recommendations:**

1. **Add a baseline-expectation question after the Preface** ("What kind of reading experience are you expecting?") to detect whether the Preface sets the right frame or over-primes.

2. **Defer question 4 to Part 2 only.** The "experience vs. argument" question plants the idea that this collection uses experiential methods. Asking it after Essay 1 partially spoils the Fish/Fishing distinction — Part 1 is supposed to work without the reader knowing they're undergoing philosophical experiments.

3. **Split the engagement/pacing question into two** — "Did you want to keep reading?" and "Where did attention flag?" test different things.

4. **Refine "worked best/worst" to "stayed with you / didn't land"** — keeps the reader in experiential-report mode rather than critical-assessment mode.

5. **Request marginal notes alongside per-essay reports, before questions** — these provide uncontaminated evidence of experiential effects, making the Critical Experiential Checks confirmatory rather than primary.

6. **Add Essay 6 (Ship of Theseus) to Critical Experiential Checks** — a well-known puzzle the reader likely already has intuitions about.

7. **Reject essay-specific per-essay questions; expand Critical Experiential Checks instead.** The key insight: essay-specific questions asked during reading would prime the reader for later essays (asking about renormalization after Essay 1 primes attention to physics metaphors in Essay 4). But essay-specific probes delivered after ALL reading is complete don't contaminate anything. I proposed 4 additional probes for Essays 1, 2, 5, and 6.

Now awaiting the editor's response or next task.
