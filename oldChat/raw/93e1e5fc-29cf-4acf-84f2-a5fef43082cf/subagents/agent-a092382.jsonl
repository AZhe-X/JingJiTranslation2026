Second, the author treats absurdity not as a permanent human condition (as in Camus) but as a structural collapse: absurdity arises when one's Jing seeks meaning externally and finds none.

This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n    74→\n    75→The author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena.

The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not.

Three points deserve advance mention here. First, the author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (\"the metaphysical\" -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (\"metaphysics\" -- the discipline that studies such constructions); we render these distinctly throughout. Second, two key concepts -- the Poetic (诗意, *shiyi*), the author's term for lucid engagement with meaning-structures, and the non-rational (非理性), the acknowledged ground of all rational activity -- are central to the collection's argument and may surprise readers expecting standard philosophical usage. Third, the reader will encounter two different English words for the same Chinese character within a single passage: 德 appears as \"virtue\" when quoting Laozi and as \"character\" when the author analyzes the concept. This is deliberate -- it reflects the author's argument that the traditional reading conceals the constructive process the essay exposes. The Glossary Introduction explains this and all other terminological decisions in full.\n    86→\n    87→---\n    88→\n    89→## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n    90→\n    91→This collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it. This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n    92→\n    93→Three examples, among many:\n    94→\n    95→In Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n    96→\n    97→In Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n    98→\n    99→In Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n   100→\n   101→We have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter. This is not a stylistic preference but a philosophical necessity: if the reader's experience is the evidence for the author's claims, then a translation that preserves the words but fails to produce the experience has lost the argument. In these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n   102→\n   103→---\n   104→\n   105→## A Note on Reading\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

It orients the reader toward the essays; it does not interpret them.\n\n#### Edit 1: Line 46 — the tricolon in \"Fish and Fishing\"\n\n**Current:**\n\"Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat.\"\n\n**Proposed:**\n\"Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of confronting the absurd through increasingly familiar examples.\"\n\n**Rationale:** The first two items name topics and methods without revealing outcomes (emergence and JTB collapse are thesis-level claims visible from the essays' openings). The third currently reveals both the outcome (\"dissolve\") and the specific example (\"cat\"). The replacement names the topic (absurdity) and the method (increasingly familiar examples) without the conclusion. This was unanimous across all plans.\n\n#### Edit 2: Line 50 — the structural claims paragraph\n\n**Current (full paragraph):**\n\"Two structural claims of the collection deserve advance notice. First, the author treats nihilism not as the negation of metaphysics but as its *consequence*: when metaphysical systems claim to describe ultimate reality and then fail, the void they leave is nihilism. Post-metaphysics is the path that emerges after recognizing this -- not by rejecting metaphysical construction, but by practicing it lucidly. Second, the author treats absurdity not as a permanent human condition (as in Camus) but as a structural collapse: absurdity arises when one's Jing seeks meaning externally and finds none. The dissolution of absurdity -- demonstrated in Essay 3 through the progression from Sisyphus to cat ownership -- occurs not through revolt but through inhabiting a Jing in which meaning is internally generated.\"\n\n**Proposed replacement:**\n\"The three essays of Part 1 examine, respectively, collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity -- each through a distinctive philosophical method the author does not yet name. The four essays of Part 2 develop the formal framework behind that method: the concepts of the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and a categorical formalism for the structure of experience. The relationship between the two parts is itself part of the argument.\"\n\n**Rationale:** The current paragraph states two philosophical conclusions and their mechanisms. The first claim (nihilism as consequence) was voted FINE by a majority but NOT FINE by a significant minority (8/11 voted the paragraph as a whole NOT FINE). The second claim (absurdity dissolution + mechanism + specific example) was unanimously identified as the most damaging spoiler. Rather than trying to save the first claim and cut the second, the cleaner editorial solution is to replace the entire paragraph with topic-level orientation. The proposed replacement (adapted from the Kantian expert's suggestion) names what the essays examine without revealing what they conclude, and its final sentence (\"The relationship between the two parts is itself part of the argument\") signals that the Fish/Fishing structure is load-bearing without saying how.\n\n**Note:** The removed content — both structural claims in full — moves to the Afterword, where it can be stated freely and expanded upon.\n\n#### Edit 3: Lines 95-96 — the Essay 3 example in \"Experiential Sequences\"\n\n**Current:**\n\"In Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload.

The progression itself is the philosophical payload: by the final example, the reader is invited to test the essay's claim against their own lived experience. The recognition that follows -- which cannot be produced by argument alone -- is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\"\n\n**Rationale:** This revision preserves: (a) the three-case structure, (b) the mythic-to-mundane direction, (c) the principle that the essay is an experiential experiment, (d) the warning about sequence integrity, (e) the claim that argument alone cannot produce the result. It removes: (f) the specific examples (Sisyphus is already in the title; the office worker and cat owner are the sequence to be experienced), (g) the punchline (\"no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it\"), (h) the mechanism. The section now practices what it preaches -- it describes the method without abstracting the experience.\n\n**Design choice:** I have removed the specific listing of the three cases (Sisyphus, office worker, cat owner). Several plans differed on whether to keep the specific examples. My editorial judgment: listing them slightly pre-loads the reader's attention and diminishes the experience of encountering each case fresh. The essay title already contains \"Sisyphus\" and \"Cats,\" which is sufficient teasing. The Preface need not enumerate what the reader will encounter in a few pages.\n\n#### Edit 4: Lines 97 — the Essay 4 example (NO CHANGE)\n\n**Current (kept as-is):**\n\"In Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the 'understood' direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the 'actual' direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\"\n\n**Rationale:** Unanimous agreement across all plans to keep this. The reversal is processual, not propositional -- knowing *that* a reversal occurs does not diminish the experience of following each step and feeling the structure invert. The essay itself announces the reversal before performing it. This is a map legend, not a spoiler.\n\n#### Edit 5: Lines 99 — the Essay 7 example (NO CHANGE)\n\nKept as-is. This describes a translation decision, not a philosophical conclusion. Unanimous agreement.\n\n#### Summary of Preface changes:\n- **3 edits** (line 46 softened, line 50 replaced, lines 95-96 rewritten)\n- **2 preserved** (lines 97, 99 kept as-is)\n- **All other sections unchanged** (On the Title, The Author, A Bilingual Collection, The Reinterpretation of 形, A Note on Terminology, A Note on Reading)\n\n---\n\n### PART 2: TRANSLATOR'S AFTERWORD\n\n#### Placement\nAfter all essays and the Appendix, before the Glossary Introduction. The reading order becomes: Translator's Preface -> Essays 1-7 -> Appendix (Essay 8) -> Translator's Afterword -> Glossary Introduction -> Glossary.\n\n#### Tone\nScholarly but accessible. The translators speaking as philosophically informed readers who have deeply engaged with the work. More analytically engaged than the Preface (since there is nothing left to protect) but not evaluative or promotional. The voice should model the kind of cross-traditional reading the work invites.\n\n#### Length\n3,000-4,000 words. (Majority recommendation; one plan suggested 2,000-3,000. I favor the longer range because the cross-traditional connections section needs room to do justice to multiple traditions without superficiality.)\n\n#### Structure\n\n**Section A: The Collection's Philosophical Argument (~800 words)**\n\nNow that the reader has experienced the essays, we can name what they demonstrate:\n\n- The structural claims removed from the Preface, stated freely and expanded: nihilism as consequence of metaphysics; absurdity as structural Jing-collapse that dissolves when meaning is internally generated; the bottom-up construction of the metaphysical from phenomena.\n- The full progression: traditional metaphysics -> nihilism -> post-metaphysics -> the poetic.\n- The Essay 3 punchline and its significance, discussed openly.\n- The Dao-De reversal's philosophical implications (how bottom-up construction is concealed and appears top-down).\n- The knowledge-as-belief thesis and its relationship to the formal apparatus.\n\nThis section answers the reader's question: \"What did I just read, taken as a whole?\"\n\n**Section B: Cross-Traditional Connections (~1,200-1,500 words)**\n\nThe Afterword's distinctive contribution -- scholarly positioning that exists nowhere else in the volume. Drawing on all nine expert analyses:\n\n- **Kantian parallels:** The meaning question as \"another kind of Kantian question\" (the author's own phrase in the Appendix). S_E as conditions of possible experience. The departure from Kant's fixed transcendental apparatus toward an evolving, constructive one. The intersubjectivity solution via natural transformation eta.\n- **Phenomenological connections:** Phenomena as starting point (cf. Husserl's Lebenswelt). The relationship between Jing and intentional constitution. Departures from Heidegger's ontological project.\n- **Existentialist positioning:** The Poetic compared with Nietzsche's amor fati, Camus's revolt, Heidegger's Gelassenheit -- and how it differs from all three. The \"livability\" of the author's post-nihilistic stance (the cat-raiser, the coin-flipper as figures of everyday life, not philosophical heroes).\n- **Buddhist structural parallels:** Madhyamaka middle way (pre-metaphysics/nihilism/post-metaphysics paralleling eternalism/nihilism/middle way). Yogacara visaya and the constructed object-domain. Chan awakening stages. The Diamond Sutra dream-simile and 梦境.\n- **Wittgensteinian resonances:** Language games and forms of life. Showing vs. saying. The therapeutic method and its relationship to the author's philosophical experiments.\n- **Chinese philosophical tradition:** The radical reinterpretation of 形, 德, and the Dao-De hierarchy. The relationship to Neo-Confucian li/qi discussions. The 意境 aesthetic tradition. How this work departs from both Confucian and Daoist orthodoxy.\n\nThis section answers the reader's question: \"How does this relate to what I already know?\"\n\n**Section C: The Experiential Method Revisited (~500 words)**\n\nThe full descriptions that were softened in the Preface can now be stated openly. The Essay 3 sequence analyzed in detail. The significance of the method -- philosophical experiments that construct a Jing for the reader. The precedents in Mencius, Zhuangzi, Wittgenstein, and experimental philosophy. The author's category-theoretic formalization of experiential method as genuinely novel.\n\nThis section also addresses the self-referential dimension: the collection itself is a philosophical experiment on the reader, and the Afterword is the moment where the reader can reflect on what just happened to them.\n\n**Section D: Translation as Philosophical Practice (~400 words)**\n\nKey translation decisions that embody philosophical arguments:\n- The 德 virtue/character split as enactment of the author's argument.\n- The \"phenomenal X\" apparatus and its philosophical motivation.\n- The meme substitution in Essay 7 (experiential fidelity over literal accuracy).\n- The choice to leave 境 untranslated.\n- The principle stated in the Preface -- \"the experience *is* the argument\" -- as the governing translation philosophy.\n\nThis section answers: \"Why does the English sound like this?\"\n\n**Section E: What Remains Open (~300 words)**\n\nHonest acknowledgment of the collection's incompleteness and open questions:\n- The working-draft character of the Part 2 essays (todo markers, the KA conjecture).\n- The question of whether stable structures S_E have normative implications.\n- The relationship to other formal frameworks (HoTT, topos theory).\n- The question of cultural relativity of stable structures.\n- The underdeveloped treatment of temporality and death.\n\nThis section answers: \"Where does this go from here?\"\n\n---\n\n### PART 3: PROCESS\n\nOnce we agree on this proposal:\n1. I will draft the specific Preface edits (exact replacement text) and circulate for final approval.\n2. The Afterword will be drafted after the full translation is further along, since it needs to reference specific passages. For now, this structural outline serves as the blueprint.\n3. The Preface edits can be applied immediately to produce DRAFT-R3.\n\n---\n\nPlease respond with **AGREE**, **DISAGREE** (with specific objection), or **AMEND** (with specific suggested change). If you have domain-specific concerns about how your tradition is represented in the Afterword outline, now is the time to raise them.","summary":"Unified spoiler resolution proposal: 3 Preface edits + Afterword blueprint"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3339,"cache_read_input_tokens":53222,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":3339},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY1uSXpyzmra7o37auDSz","type":"assistant","uuid":"18ff041f-6fb4-44b2-8a6a-5c9a5466b512","timestamp":"2026-02-11T07:43:19.996Z"}

I will revise based on feedback until we reach consensus.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### PART 1: PREFACE EDITS\\n\\nThe guiding principle: the Preface should name **topics** and describe **methods** without revealing **conclusions** or **experiential payoffs**. It orients the reader toward the essays; it does not interpret them.\\n\\n#### Edit 1: Line 46 — the tricolon in \\\"Fish and Fishing\\\"\\n\\n**Current:**\\n\\\"Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat.\\\"\\n\\n**Proposed:**\\n\\\"Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of confronting the absurd through increasingly familiar examples.\\\"\\n\\n**Rationale:** The first two items name topics and methods without revealing outcomes (emergence and JTB collapse are thesis-level claims visible from the essays' openings). The third currently reveals both the outcome (\\\"dissolve\\\") and the specific example (\\\"cat\\\"). The replacement names the topic (absurdity) and the method (increasingly familiar examples) without the conclusion. This was unanimous across all plans.\\n\\n#### Edit 2: Line 50 — the structural claims paragraph\\n\\n**Current (full paragraph):**\\n\\\"Two structural claims of the collection deserve advance notice. First, the author treats nihilism not as the negation of metaphysics but as its *consequence*: when metaphysical systems claim to describe ultimate reality and then fail, the void they leave is nihilism. Post-metaphysics is the path that emerges after recognizing this -- not by rejecting metaphysical construction, but by practicing it lucidly. Second, the author treats absurdity not as a permanent human condition (as in Camus) but as a structural collapse: absurdity arises when one's Jing seeks meaning externally and finds none. The dissolution of absurdity -- demonstrated in Essay 3 through the progression from Sisyphus to cat ownership -- occurs not through revolt but through inhabiting a Jing in which meaning is internally generated.\\\"\\n\\n**Proposed replacement:**\\n\\\"The three essays of Part 1 examine, respectively, collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity -- each through a distinctive philosophical method the author does not yet name. The four essays of Part 2 develop the formal framework behind that method: the concepts of the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and a categorical formalism for the structure of experience. The relationship between the two parts is itself part of the argument.\\\"\\n\\n**Rationale:** The current paragraph states two philosophical conclusions and their mechanisms. The first claim (nihilism as consequence) was voted FINE by a majority but NOT FINE by a significant minority (8/11 voted the paragraph as a whole NOT FINE). The second claim (absurdity dissolution + mechanism + specific example) was unanimously identified as the most damaging spoiler. Rather than trying to save the first claim and cut the second, the cleaner editorial solution is to replace the entire paragraph with topic-level orientation. The proposed replacement (adapted from the Kantian expert's suggestion) names what the essays examine without revealing what they conclude, and its final sentence (\\\"The relationship between the two parts is itself part of the argument\\\") signals that the Fish/Fishing structure is load-bearing without saying how.\\n\\n**Note:** The removed content — both structural claims in full — moves to the Afterword, where it can be stated freely and expanded upon.\\n\\n#### Edit 3: Lines 95-96 — the Essay 3 example in \\\"Experiential Sequences\\\"\\n\\n**Current:**\\n\\\"In Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box.

The essay itself announces the reversal before performing it. This is a map legend, not a spoiler.\n\n#### Edit 5: Lines 99 — the Essay 7 example (NO CHANGE)\n\nKept as-is. This describes a translation decision, not a philosophical conclusion. Unanimous agreement.\n\n#### Summary of Preface changes:\n- **3 edits** (line 46 softened, line 50 replaced, lines 95-96 rewritten)\n- **2 preserved** (lines 97, 99 kept as-is)\n- **All other sections unchanged** (On the Title, The Author, A Bilingual Collection, The Reinterpretation of 形, A Note on Terminology, A Note on Reading)\n\n---\n\n### PART 2: TRANSLATOR'S AFTERWORD\n\n#### Placement\nAfter all essays and the Appendix, before the Glossary Introduction. The reading order becomes: Translator's Preface -> Essays 1-7 -> Appendix (Essay 8) -> Translator's Afterword -> Glossary Introduction -> Glossary.\n\n#### Tone\nScholarly but accessible. The translators speaking as philosophically informed readers who have deeply engaged with the work. More analytically engaged than the Preface (since there is nothing left to protect) but not evaluative or promotional. The voice should model the kind of cross-traditional reading the work invites.\n\n#### Length\n3,000-4,000 words. (Majority recommendation; one plan suggested 2,000-3,000. I favor the longer range because the cross-traditional connections section needs room to do justice to multiple traditions without superficiality.)\n\n#### Structure\n\n**Section A: The Collection's Philosophical Argument (~800 words)**\n\nNow that the reader has experienced the essays, we can name what they demonstrate:\n\n- The structural claims removed from the Preface, stated freely and expanded: nihilism as consequence of metaphysics; absurdity as structural Jing-collapse that dissolves when meaning is internally generated; the bottom-up construction of the metaphysical from phenomena.\n- The full progression: traditional metaphysics -> nihilism -> post-metaphysics -> the poetic.\n- The Essay 3 punchline and its significance, discussed openly.\n- The Dao-De reversal's philosophical implications (how bottom-up construction is concealed and appears top-down).\n- The knowledge-as-belief thesis and its relationship to the formal apparatus.\n\nThis section answers the reader's question: \"What did I just read, taken as a whole?\"\n\n**Section B: Cross-Traditional Connections (~1,200-1,500 words)**\n\nThe Afterword's distinctive contribution -- scholarly positioning that exists nowhere else in the volume. Drawing on all nine expert analyses:\n\n- **Kantian parallels:** The meaning question as \"another kind of Kantian question\" (the author's own phrase in the Appendix). S_E as conditions of possible experience. The departure from Kant's fixed transcendental apparatus toward an evolving, constructive one. The intersubjectivity solution via natural transformation eta.\n- **Phenomenological connections:** Phenomena as starting point (cf. Husserl's Lebenswelt). The relationship between Jing and intentional constitution. Departures from Heidegger's ontological project.\n- **Existentialist positioning:** The Poetic compared with Nietzsche's amor fati, Camus's revolt, Heidegger's Gelassenheit -- and how it differs from all three. The \"livability\" of the author's post-nihilistic stance (the cat-raiser, the coin-flipper as figures of everyday life, not philosophical heroes).\n- **Buddhist structural parallels:** Madhyamaka middle way (pre-metaphysics/nihilism/post-metaphysics paralleling eternalism/nihilism/middle way). Yogacara visaya and the constructed object-domain. Chan awakening stages. The Diamond Sutra dream-simile and 梦境.\n- **Wittgensteinian resonances:** Language games and forms of life. Showing vs. saying. The therapeutic method and its relationship to the author's philosophical experiments.\n- **Chinese philosophical tradition:** The radical reinterpretation of 形, 德, and the Dao-De hierarchy. The relationship to Neo-Confucian li/qi discussions. The 意境 aesthetic tradition. How this work departs from both Confucian and Daoist orthodoxy.\n\nThis section answers the reader's question: \"How does this relate to what I already know?\"\n\n**Section C: The Experiential Method Revisited (~500 words)**\n\nThe full descriptions that were softened in the Preface can now be stated openly. The Essay 3 sequence analyzed in detail. The significance of the method -- philosophical experiments that construct a Jing for the reader. The precedents in Mencius, Zhuangzi, Wittgenstein, and experimental philosophy. The author's category-theoretic formalization of experiential method as genuinely novel.\n\nThis section also addresses the self-referential dimension: the collection itself is a philosophical experiment on the reader, and the Afterword is the moment where the reader can reflect on what just happened to them.\n\n**Section D: Translation as Philosophical Practice (~400 words)**\n\nKey translation decisions that embody philosophical arguments:\n- The 德 virtue/character split as enactment of the author's argument.\n- The \"phenomenal X\" apparatus and its philosophical motivation.\n- The meme substitution in Essay 7 (experiential fidelity over literal accuracy).\n- The choice to leave 境 untranslated.\n- The principle stated in the Preface -- \"the experience *is* the argument\" -- as the governing translation philosophy.\n\nThis section answers: \"Why does the English sound like this?\"\n\n**Section E: What Remains Open (~300 words)**\n\nHonest acknowledgment of the collection's incompleteness and open questions:\n- The working-draft character of the Part 2 essays (todo markers, the KA conjecture).\n- The question of whether stable structures S_E have normative implications.\n- The relationship to other formal frameworks (HoTT, topos theory).\n- The question of cultural relativity of stable structures.\n- The underdeveloped treatment of temporality and death.\n\nThis section answers: \"Where does this go from here?\"\n\n---\n\n### PART 3: PROCESS\n\nOnce we agree on this proposal:\n1. I will draft the specific Preface edits (exact replacement text) and circulate for final approval.\n2. The Afterword will be drafted after the full translation is further along, since it needs to reference specific passages. For now, this structural outline serves as the blueprint.\n3. The Preface edits can be applied immediately to produce DRAFT-R3.\n\n---\n\nPlease respond with **AGREE**, **DISAGREE** (with specific objection), or **AMEND** (with specific suggested change). If you have domain-specific concerns about how your tradition is represented in the Afterword outline, now is the time to raise them."}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"18ff041f-6fb4-44b2-8a6a-5c9a5466b512"}
