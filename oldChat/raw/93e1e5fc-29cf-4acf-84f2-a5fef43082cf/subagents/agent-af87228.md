*形而上 etymology lost in translation — problem?*

The author just noticed something about the sentence: 因此，道既是最上者，是为形而上，而礼既是最下者，是为形。

The Chinese word 形而上 (metaphysical) literally contains:
- 形 (xing) = form/phenomena
- 而上 = "and above"

So 形而上 literally means "above the phenomenal/formal." The author's sentence exploits this internal structure: 道 is the HIGHEST (最上者), and is 形而上 (above form); 礼 is the LOWEST (最下者), and is 形 (form itself).

The English "metaphysical" loses this entirely — the reader cannot see that "metaphysical" literally means "above the phenomenal" or that "the phenomenal" (形) is embedded inside the word "metaphysical" (形而上).

Current translation: "Thus the Way is the highest — it is the metaphysical — while ritual conduct is the lowest — it is the phenomenal."

Questions:
1. Is losing this etymological wordplay a big problem for the reader's understanding of the passage?
2. If so, should we add a TN explaining the 形/形而上 structure?
3. Or is there a way to render it in English that preserves the relationship (e.g., "above-the-phenomenal" for 形而上)?

Brief responses.

In English, \"the metaphysical\" and \"the phenomenal\" appear to be two unrelated terms.

Waiting for the team lead's next question or instruction.
