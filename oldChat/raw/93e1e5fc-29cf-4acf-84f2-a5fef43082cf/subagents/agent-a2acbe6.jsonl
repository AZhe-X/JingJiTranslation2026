We recommended using a standard translation (Lau) in the block quote.

A standard rendering makes this instant. A custom rendering forces them to reverse-engineer which passage is being quoted.\n\n**The solution we already have is correct:**\n- Block quote: standard translation, attributed (e.g., \"trans. Lau\")\n- Author's analysis: introduce our terms with explicit justification for departure\n- This *demonstrates* sinological competence (the author knows the standard) while *also* making their own scholarly contribution (the author argues the standard is inadequate for their purposes)\n\nIf the author is second-guessing Option B, they shouldn't.
