*AGREE, with note to include Hua-yen/Indra's net in Afterword*

**AGREE** — with one domain-specific note for the Afterword blueprint.

The Buddhist connections in Section B are well-scoped. One addition I would recommend when the Afterword is drafted: the Hua-yen (華嚴) parallel deserves explicit mention alongside the Madhyamaka and Yogacara connections. The author's tower structure — where morphisms are themselves objects with their own morphisms, creating mutual interpenetration at every level — is a formal expression of Fa-zang's Indra's net (因陀羅網). This is arguably the single closest Buddhist structural analog to the category-theoretic framework, and it comes from a tradition English-language readers are less likely to know. A sentence or two in the Buddhist subsection of Section B would suffice.

This is not an objection to the current proposal — just a note for drafting. The outline as written already has room for it. Everything else — the three Preface edits, the Afterword structure, the placement, the tone, the process — is exactly right.
