Please read and share your thoughts with me.\n\n---\n\n**Editor's assessment:** The Preface is slightly long at ~2,500 words, but within normal range (standard is 1,500-3,000 for philosophically complex translations).\n\n**Editor's recommendation — Option B (strongest move):** Move the entire Key Terminological Decisions section (~800 words) out of the Preface and into a glossary introduction. This would:\n- Cut the Preface to ~1,700 words\n- Create a clean narrative arc: title → author → structure → bilingual nature → 形 reinterpretation → experiential sequences → reading advice\n- Put terminology discussion where readers will actually consult it — adjacent to the glossary itself\n- Make the Preface something a reader actually reads cover-to-cover before Essay 1\n\n**Two smaller trims also suggested:**\n1. Cut the working-draft quality paragraph from the Author section (~80 words) — redundant with Fish/Fishing section and Reading Note.\n2. Simplify the Bilingual Collection forward references (~40 words) — \"digestion,\" \"knowledge sub-category\" are forward references that confuse first-time readers. Replace with: \"Three translator's footnotes within the essay connect its key terms to the formal apparatus of Part 2.\"\n\n**What stays (non-negotiable per editor):**\n- On the Title\n- Fish and Fishing\n- The Reinterpretation of 形\n- Experiential Sequences\n- A Note on Reading\n\n---\n\nDo you agree with the editor's Option B (move terminology to glossary intro)? Or should terminology stay in the Preface? Brief response — agree/disagree + one-sentence reason.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"cc7af0ef-88c0-4b0e-ae8c-0b0254e93fa0","timestamp":"2026-02-11T06:29:50.172Z"}
