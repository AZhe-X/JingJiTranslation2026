*Debate *

The author wants to discuss chinese-phil-expert's proposal: "constitutive nature" for 德.

Chinese-phil-expert's argument was:
- "Constitutive" means "having the power to establish or compose" — neutral on whether innate or constructed
- "Nature" captures "what-it-is-ness" without moral baggage
- Has philosophical pedigree across Kant (constitutive vs. regulative), phenomenology (constitutive analysis), and philosophy of science
- Maps well to the author's constructivist usage: 德 is the constitutive principle that emerges from bottom-up assembly of phenomena

Those who voted differently: what is your specific objection to "constitutive nature"? And chinese-phil-expert: defend it against the main counterarguments (too heavy for running text? "nature" collides with 性?)

Brief responses please — focus on the strongest objection or defense.

In phenomenology, \"constitutive analysis\" means something precise about how consciousness structures objects. A reader trained in either tradition will read \"constitutive nature\" through those lenses — and the author is doing neither Kantian constitution nor Husserlian constitutive analysis.

Sent my objection: "constitutive" is a term of art that imports Kantian/phenomenological frameworks the author is not working within, while "defining" is plain English that maps directly to the author's own word 定义. But I noted it's my second choice and I wouldn't object if the team prefers it.
