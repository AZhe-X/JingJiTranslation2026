*All 3 Preface edits + YAML applied, DRAFT-R3 confirmed*

All edits applied and verified. The Translator's Preface is now DRAFT-R3.

**Summary of changes made:**

1. **Edit 1 (line 46):** "of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat" -> "of confronting the absurd through increasingly familiar examples"

2. **Edit 2 (line 50):** Full structural claims paragraph replaced with topic-only text: "The three essays of Part 1 examine, respectively, collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity -- each through a distinctive philosophical method the author does not yet name. The four essays of Part 2 develop the formal framework behind that method: the concepts of the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and a categorical formalism for the structure of experience. The relationship between the two parts is itself part of the argument."

3. **Edit 3 (line 95):** Essay 3 punchline and case listing removed. New text describes method without revealing result: "In Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order, progressing from the mythic to the mundane. The progression itself is the philosophical payload: by the final example, the reader is invited to test the essay's claim against their own experience. The recognition that follows -- which cannot be produced by argument alone -- is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it."

4. **YAML header:** Status updated to DRAFT-R3 with full note documenting changes, consensus, and dissents.

5. **Lines 97, 99:** Confirmed unchanged.
