Good calibration question. If the reader can predict specific experiential outcomes from the Preface alone, we know R3 still spoils too much.\n\n**REVISION 2 (Defer Q4 to Part 2 only):** APPROVE. This is exactly my recommendation. The counter to phil-mind-expert's concern is stated well -- if Q2 doesn't surface experiential effects unprompted, that silence is itself data.\n\n**REVISION 3 (Split engagement/pacing question):** APPROVE. Clean separation of distinct experiential dimensions.\n\n**REVISION 4 (Stayed with you / didn't land):** APPROVE. The shift from evaluative to experiential framing is correct for this protocol's purpose.\n\n**REVISION 5 (Request marginal notes):** APPROVE. The revised optional framing (\"If you made any marks or notes...\") handles the self-consciousness issue well. Pre-reflective data is more valuable than post-hoc answers to our questions.\n\n**REVISION 6 (No essay-specific per-essay questions):** APPROVE. Unanimous is right. This is the most important architectural decision in the protocol.\n\n**REVISION 7 (Expand Critical Experiential Checks):** APPROVE WITH AMENDMENTS.\n\nThree points:\n\n(a) **Essay 3 probe -- my earlier recommendation stands**: \"across the three examples\" should be \"as you moved through the essay's examples.\" The essay has four stages (Sisyphus, office worker, entrepreneur, cat owner). Saying \"three\" may cause the reader to skip reporting on the entrepreneur pivot, which is structurally important -- it is where alienation is isolated as the variable. This is a small wording change but it matters for what data we get back.\n\n(b) **Essay 7 probe -- strong agreement with the design principle** you attributed to me. Correct: do NOT name the sentences. Whether the reader recalls which two sentences are being referenced is diagnostic. However, I want to flag again: this probe also tests the English meme-sentence substitution. A negative result is ambiguous between \"the experiment doesn't work\" and \"the English substitute doesn't produce the right structural position.\" The analysis team should be prepared for this interpretive challenge. This doesn't change the probe wording -- just the internal interpretation.\n\n(c) **Essay 1 probe -- mild concern**: \"There's an extended comparison to physics\" is slightly leading in that it directs the reader to the renormalization analogy specifically. The essay also contains the ocean-wave analogy, the cell/body analogy, and the final reflection on individual interest as itself an abstraction. A more open probe might be: \"What stood out to you from the first essay?\" But I recognize this may be too generic to draw out anything useful. I don't object to the current wording -- just noting the trade-off.\n\n**REVISION 8 (Internal flag for Essay 5-6 transition):** APPROVE. This is a good catch. The register shift is sharp and the generic pacing questions should surface it, but actively watching for it is prudent.\n\n**OVERALL: APPROVE WITH THE ESSAY 3 WORDING AMENDMENT.** Everything else is either approved outright or flagged as a non-blocking observation.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"92603b3d-d429-450d-a7fe-7b5edad400fe","timestamp":"2026-02-11T09:22:25.855Z"}
