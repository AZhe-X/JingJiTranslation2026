*Review proposed translator profile*

DISCUSSION: Proposed profile for the dedicated philosophical translator agent. Please review and respond with whether you AGREE, or if you want to ADD, CHANGE, or REMOVE anything.

Proposed profile:
1. Native-level command of both Chinese and English
2. Philosophical training (not purely literary)
3. Literary sensibility (not purely academic)
4. Category theory / mathematical notation literacy
5. Experience with register shifts (colloquial ↔ technical ↔ poetic)
6. Translator models: Burton Watson, A.C. Graham, Brook Ziporyn

Please respond with:
- AGREE (if you're satisfied with the profile as-is)
- Or specific additions/changes/removals with justification

This is discussion time -- if you disagree with another expert's suggestion, say so. We want consensus before proceeding.

As discussed in my Section 11, the experiential arc of each essay is load-bearing -- the pacing, the order of examples, the buildup to reversal moments. This is not a standard requirement for philosophical translation. Burton Watson translating the Zhuangzi had this sensitivity; someone translating analytic philosophy papers would not need it.

Vote sent. I agree with the proposed profile and added two points:

1. **Sensitivity to performative/experimental dimensions** -- the essays' experiential arcs are load-bearing and must be preserved
2. **Familiarity with existing English translations of Chinese philosophical terms** -- the translator must know how Legge, Waley, Watson, Graham, Ziporyn etc. have rendered key terms, to position the author's non-standard usage correctly

I also clarified which translator model (Watson/Graham/Ziporyn) is best suited to which essays, and noted one thing I would NOT add (contemporary Chinese internet culture expertise).
