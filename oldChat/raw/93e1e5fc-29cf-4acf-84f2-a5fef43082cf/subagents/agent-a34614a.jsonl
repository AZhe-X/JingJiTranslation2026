Edit 3 (Essay 3 rewrite) is particularly well-crafted — it practices what it preaches by describing the method without abstracting the experience. The decision to remove the specific case listing (Sisyphus, office worker, cat) is the right editorial call; the essay title already does sufficient teasing.\n\nEdit 4 (keeping Essay 4 as-is) is also correct — the reversal is processual, and the essay itself announces it before performing it.\n\n**AMEND — Section B (Cross-Traditional Connections), Philosophy of Mind:**\n\nThe outline currently places the intersubjectivity solution via eta under \"Kantian parallels.\" I recommend it be treated under a dedicated Philosophy of Mind subsection instead (or at minimum cross-referenced there), because the eta-based intersubjectivity account is primarily a philosophy-of-mind contribution that *subsumes* several existing proposals as special cases:\n\n- Zahavi's empathy as other-directed intentionality (shared eta)\n- Gallese's shared manifold hypothesis (shared eta in sensorimotor subcategory)\n- Brandom's inferentialism (shared eta in language subcategory)\n\nIt also connects directly to the other-minds argument in Essay 4 (the projection of phenomenal humaneness/rightness onto others), which is a philosophy-of-mind point, not a Kantian one. The Kantian parallel for intersubjectivity is real but narrower — it concerns the transcendental conditions for shared experience, whereas the eta account provides a structural mechanism.\n\nI would suggest the Philosophy of Mind subsection in Section B cover:\n- The natural transformation (eta) model of understanding\n- The other-minds argument in Essay 4\n- Intersubjectivity via shared eta-structure (structural commensurability without shared qualia)\n- The tower structure as meta-cognition model (cf. Higher-Order Thought theories)\n- The \"philosophical experiment\" methodology and neurophenomenology (Varela)\n- The \"basket\" metaphor and cognitive closure (McGinn)\n\nThis is a minor structural point — the content would be the same either way. Everything else in the proposal is excellent.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"91275fc6-0c05-40ab-a668-9a2569fcdc01","timestamp":"2026-02-11T07:48:43.401Z"}
