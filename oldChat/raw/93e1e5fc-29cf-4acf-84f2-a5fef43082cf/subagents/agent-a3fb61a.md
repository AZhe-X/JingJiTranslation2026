*Prior paragraph already explains 形而上 — still need inline?*

New context: the author points out that BEFORE the 道德仁义礼 passage, there is already a paragraph that explicitly explains the 形/形而上/上 structure:

"前形而上学有一个形式上的错误理解，既是对'上'的理解。形而上学的英文，'metaphysics'，字面上来看，既是元物理。倘若把物理理解为现象，那么形而上学所描述的，既是产生现象的原因。然而事实上...形而上学事实上是自现象而产生的。所谓'上'，应当是我们基于现象之上而有的一套理解，而非自上而下由形而上生成了形。"

This paragraph already:
- Explains that "metaphysics" literally means 元物理 (meta-physics)
- Reinterprets 上 (above) as "built upon phenomena" not "generating phenomena from above"
- Explicitly says the direction is wrong: 形而上 should mean "constructed upon 形," not "generating 形 from above"

Given that the reader will have ALREADY read this explanation before encountering the 道德仁义礼 sentence ("the Way is 形而上, ritual conduct is 形"), is the inline "above-the-phenomenal" still needed? Or is a TN sufficient — since the author's own text already does the explanatory work?

Reconsider. Brief response.

**A TN is sufficient. Drop the inline calque.**

If the author's own preceding paragraph already explicitly deconstructs the 形/形而上/上 structure — reinterpreting the directionality, explaining the meta-physics etymology, arguing that 形而上 means "constructed upon phenomena" rather than "generating phenomena from above" — then the reader arrives at the 道德仁义礼 sentence *already equipped* with the structural understanding.

The inline "above-the-phenomenal" calque would actually be counterproductive in this context, because:

1. **It reinstates the naive reading the author just dismantled.** "Above-the-phenomenal" implies the vertical directionality (上 = above) that the preceding paragraph explicitly rejects. The author argued that 上 should mean "built upon," not "above." Our calque would undo that work.

2. **The author's own text is doing the job better than we can.** A translator's inline calque is a workaround for when the source text doesn't explain itself. Here, the source text *does* explain itself — and more precisely than any calque could.

3. **Redundancy signals distrust of the reader.** If the explanation is already there one paragraph earlier, re-explaining inline says "I don't think you were paying attention."

**Recommendation:**
- Block quote: use "metaphysical (形而上, *xing er shang*)" and "the phenomenal (形, *xing*)" — standard glossed format
- Brief TN: cross-reference the preceding paragraph's discussion of 形而上 for readers who want to revisit the structural analysis
- No inline calque

The author's own text is the best translation apparatus here. Trust it.

Revised my recommendation: drop the "above-the-phenomenal" inline calque entirely. The author's own preceding paragraph already deconstructs the 形/形而上 structure more precisely than any translator's apparatus could — and critically, the calque would actually *contradict* the author's reinterpretation of 上 as "built upon" rather than "above." Standard glossed format plus a brief cross-referencing TN is all that's needed. Trust the author's text.
