One remaining issue I want to flag:\n\n**Essay 3 Critical Check (line 84):** \"What happened to your experience across the three examples?\"\n\nThis still says \"three examples.\" The essay contains four stages: Sisyphus, the office worker, the entrepreneur, and the cat owner. The entrepreneur is the pivot (structurally identical labor to the office worker, but no absurdity because the meaning is internal). A reader might segment the essay as three examples (grouping office worker and entrepreneur) or four (separating them). Saying \"three\" imposes a segmentation that may not match theirs, which undermines the non-leading principle stated in line 91.\n\nI recommend changing to:\n\n> \"What happened to your experience across the examples in Essay 3?\"\n\nThis is a minor wording change that makes the probe genuinely non-leading about how the reader parsed the essay's structure. Whether they say \"three\" or \"four\" or describe them differently is itself data.\n\nEverything else looks right. The Essay 2 probe was resolved well via the Bob-scenarios approach, with the register test handled indirectly through Internal Analysis Note #2. The overall architecture is sound.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"80a257e1-6b4a-451c-afd5-addd0b25fc4c","timestamp":"2026-02-11T09:22:54.727Z"}
