Philosophical training (not purely literary)\n3. Literary sensibility (not purely academic)\n4. Category theory / mathematical notation literacy\n5. Experience with register shifts (colloquial ↔ technical ↔ poetic)\n6. Translator models: Burton Watson, A.C.

The translator needs to understand this and preserve it. This is different from standard \"literary sensibility\" (point 3). A literary translator preserves beauty; what we need here is a translator who understands that the *argumentative sequence itself* is doing experiential work on the reader, and who can reproduce that effect in English.\n\nThis is not covered by \"literary sensibility\" or \"philosophical training\" individually -- it requires the specific understanding that philosophical prose can be simultaneously descriptive and performative. The translator models listed (Watson, Graham, Ziporyn) are excellent for classical Chinese philosophical translation, but none of them faced the challenge of translating prose that is *designed to restructure the reader's experience in real time through carefully sequenced examples*. The closest precedent I can think of in philosophical translation is the challenge of translating Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations, where the sequence of examples and remarks is itself philosophically load-bearing and cannot be rearranged.\n\n**Proposed wording:** Add point 7: \"Awareness that certain passages function as philosophical experiments on the reader -- the translator must preserve exact sequencing, pacing, and escalation of examples, not merely their propositional content.\"\n\n### Addition 2: Familiarity with Kantian/transcendental terminology in English\n\nThis is a narrower point. The author explicitly frames the meaning question as \"another kind of Kantian question\" and the appendix draws a parallel with Kant's project of \"laying a legitimacy foundation.\" English-language readers with philosophical training will approach this work through the Kantian lens first -- it is the most accessible Western framework for understanding what the author is doing. The translator needs to know the standard English translations of key Kantian terms (phenomenon/appearance, thing-in-itself, synthetic a priori, conditions of possibility, transcendental, categories, forms of intuition, etc.) well enough to deploy or avoid Kantian terminology with precision. Accidentally using \"transcendental\" where the author means something different, or avoiding it where the parallel is intended, would mislead readers.\n\nThis may already be covered by \"philosophical training\" (point 2), but given the explicit Kantian dimension of the text, it is worth specifying.\n\n**Proposed wording:** Amend point 2 to: \"Philosophical training (not purely literary), with particular familiarity with Kantian/transcendental terminology in English, given the author's explicit engagement with this tradition.\"\n\n### On the translator models\n\nWatson, Graham, and Ziporyn are excellent choices for the classical Chinese material. I would add one more model for the more technical/contemporary essays: **the English translations of Husserl by Dermot Moran or David Carr** -- not because the author is Husserlian, but because these translators successfully render dense phenomenological-technical prose in clear English while preserving the precise structure of the arguments. The K1策略 and 范畴论与境 essays require this kind of technical-yet-readable prose, which is a different register from what Watson or Graham typically produce.\n\n### On category theory / mathematical notation literacy (point 4)\n\nAGREE this is essential. I want to reinforce: the mathematical notation must be rendered in standard English mathematical conventions. LaTeX formatting, standard category-theory terminology (functor, natural transformation, universal property, colimit, etc.), and the author's own notational choices (E, P, T, S_E, etc.) should all be preserved exactly. The translator does not need to be a mathematician, but needs enough literacy to avoid introducing errors into the formalism.\n\n### Everything else\n\nPoints 1, 3, 5, 6 -- fully agree as stated.
