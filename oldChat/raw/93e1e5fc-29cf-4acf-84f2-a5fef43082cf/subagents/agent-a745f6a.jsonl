Please review and respond with **APPROVE**, **APPROVE WITH AMENDMENT** (state the amendment), or **OBJECT** (state reason). I'll iterate until we reach consensus.\n\n---\n\n### REVISION 1: Add baseline-expectation question after Preface\n\n**Current:** 3 questions (oriented? too much/too little? wish told/not told?)\n\n**Proposed addition:**\n> \"Based on the preface alone, what kind of reading experience are you expecting?\"\n\n**Rationale:** Gives us a baseline to compare against actual experience. Also tests whether the Preface over-primes (e.g., if reader says \"I expect to feel absurdity dissolve through a cat example,\" we've spoiled too much). Supported by phenomenology-expert (baseline expectation is standard in phenomenological research design), epistemology-expert (calibration question), and my own analysis.\n\n**Status:** Broadly supported. No objections received.\n\n---\n\n### REVISION 2: Defer question 4 to Part 2 essays only\n\n**Current:** All 5 per-essay questions delivered after every essay, including: \"Did you feel like the essay was asking you to *experience* something rather than just understand an argument?\"\n\n**Proposed change:** Deliver question 4 only from **Essay 4 onward** (Part 2). For Essays 1-3 (Part 1 / Fish), use only questions 1-3 and 5.\n\n**Rationale:** Part 1 (Fish) is designed to work without the reader knowing they're undergoing philosophical experiments. Asking \"did the essay ask you to *experience* something?\" after Essay 1 plants the experiential-method idea, partially spoiling the Fish/Fishing distinction. The \"clicked or shifted\" question (Q2) already captures experiential effects without naming the method. Supported by wittgenstein-expert (naming the method defeats it), chinese-phil-expert (the Fish/Fishing structure depends on this naivete), buddhism-expert (parallel to not explaining a koan before giving it), and kantian-expert (priming concern).\n\n**Dissent:** phil-mind-expert notes that some readers may not report experiential effects at all without prompting — Q2 alone may not surface them. **Counter:** If Q2 doesn't surface them unprompted, that's itself diagnostic — it means the experiential sequences didn't produce strong enough effects to be noticed without a leading question.\n\n**Status:** Strong majority support. Phil-mind-expert's concern noted but overridden by anti-priming consensus.\n\n---\n\n### REVISION 3: Split engagement/pacing question into two\n\n**Current:** \"Did you want to keep reading? Where did your attention flag?\"\n\n**Proposed split:**\n> Q5a: \"Did you want to keep reading after this essay?\"\n> Q5b: \"Were there any passages where your attention flagged or you had to push through?\"\n\n**Rationale:** These test different things. A reader might say \"yes, I wanted to keep reading\" AND report three passages where attention flagged. Combining them into one question risks losing the pacing data. Supported by epistemology-expert (double-barreled questions are methodologically weak), phenomenology-expert (engagement and difficulty are distinct experiential dimensions).\n\n**Status:** Broadly supported. No objections.\n\n---\n\n### REVISION 4: Refine \"worked best/worst\" wording\n\n**Current:** \"Which essays worked best and worst as reading experiences? Why?\"\n\n**Proposed revision:**\n> \"Which essays stayed with you most, and which felt like they didn't fully land? Why?\"\n\n**Rationale:** \"Worked best and worst\" puts the reader in critical-assessment mode. \"Stayed with you / didn't land\" keeps them in experiential-report mode — more consistent with the protocol's overall approach. Supported by phenomenology-expert (experiential vs. evaluative framing), metaphysics-expert (avoids implying there are \"right answers\").\n\n**Minor dissent:** translator-2 prefers the original wording as more direct. **Counter:** Directness is good, but the shift from evaluative to experiential framing serves the protocol's purpose better.\n\n**Status:** Majority support. Translator-2's preference noted.\n\n---\n\n### REVISION 5: Request marginal notes alongside per-essay reports\n\n**Current:** Reading instructions say \"mark it\" but don't explicitly ask the reader to submit marginal notes.\n\n**Proposed addition to per-essay delivery:** Before delivering the per-essay questions, add:\n> \"Before answering the questions below, please first share any marginal notes or marks you made while reading this essay.\"\n\n**Rationale:** Marginal notes are uncontaminated by the reporting questions — they capture what the reader noticed *during* reading, before any post-hoc framing. This makes the Critical Experiential Checks at the end confirmatory rather than primary. Supported by phenomenology-expert (pre-reflective data is more reliable), kantian-expert (distinguishes between experience and retrospective report), phil-mind-expert (ecological validity).\n\n**Potential issue (buddhism-expert):** Some readers may not make marginal notes at all, or may feel self-conscious about sharing \"rough\" notes. **Mitigation:** Frame it as optional: \"If you made any marks or notes while reading, please share them first.\" This avoids making non-note-takers feel they failed a task.\n\n**Revised wording:**\n> \"If you made any marks or notes while reading, please share them now — even brief ones. Then answer the questions below.\"\n\n**Status:** Broadly supported with revised framing.\n\n---\n\n### REVISION 6: NO essay-specific per-essay questions\n\n**The team lead asked whether to add essay-specific questions alongside the generic per-essay template.**\n\n**Decision: NO. Unanimous.**\n\n**Rationale:** Essay-specific questions inherently reveal what we think is important about each essay, priming the reader for later essays. If we ask about renormalization after Essay 1, the reader approaches Essay 4's physics metaphors with heightened attention. If we ask about sequential examples after Essay 2, the reader watches for them in Essay 3. This is the exact contamination the protocol extraction was designed to prevent.\n\nAll submissions independently converge on this conclusion. The right architecture is already in the protocol: generic questions during reading, targeted probes after all reading is complete.\n\n**Status:** Unanimous. No essay-specific per-essay questions.\n\n---\n\n### REVISION 7: Expand Critical Experiential Checks\n\n**Current:** 3 probes (Essay 3, Essay 4, Essay 7)\n\n**Proposed expansion to 7 probes:**\n\n1. **Essay 1:** \"In the first essay, there's an extended comparison to physics. How did that land for you?\"\n2. **Essay 2:** \"Essay 2 was written in English by the author. Did you notice a difference? What was it like?\"\n3. **Essay 3:** \"What happened to your experience across the three examples?\" *(unchanged)*\n4. **Essay 4:** \"When the author walked through the hierarchy twice, what did you notice?\" *(unchanged)*\n5. **Essay 5:** \"What did you make of the dreamscape concept?\"\n6. **Essay 6:** \"In Essay 6, the author uses magic book stories to explain mathematical concepts, and also discusses the Ship of Theseus. What was your experience of those passages?\"\n7. **Essay 7:** \"When you encountered the two contrasting sentences, what was your experience?\" *(unchanged)*\n8. **Appendix:** \"In the Appendix, the author discusses coin-flipping and lists many everyday activities. What was your experience of those passages?\"\n\n**Rationale:** Each essay has distinct experiential payloads that generic questions may not draw out. Since these probes are delivered only after ALL reading is complete, they cannot contaminate the reading experience. All probes are non-leading and open-ended.\n\n**Key design principle (wittgenstein-expert):** The Essay 7 probe should NOT name the sentences — whether the reader can recall which two sentences are being referred to is itself diagnostic of whether the contrast landed.\n\n**Supported by:** All submissions independently recommend expanding this section. Specific probe suggestions converge strongly.\n\n**Status:** Strong consensus. Minor wording variations to be settled.\n\n---\n\n### REVISION 8: Add structural flag — Essay 5 to Essay 6 transition\n\n**This is not a protocol change but a data-watching instruction.**\n\n**Proposed addition to the protocol (as an internal note, not delivered to reader):**\n\n> *Internal note for analysis:* Watch the per-essay reports for the Essay 5 → Essay 6 transition. This is the sharpest register shift in the collection (poetic-philosophical to mathematical-methodological). If the reader reports losing momentum, flagging attention, or confusion at this boundary, this is important data about whether we need a stronger bridge in the translation apparatus.\n\n**Rationale:** Identified through re-reading all essays in sequence. Essay 5 ends abruptly; Essay 6 opens with methodological preamble. The generic Q5a/Q5b (\"want to keep reading?\" / \"attention flag?\") should capture this, but we should actively watch for it.\n\n**Status:** Informational. No objections expected.\n\n---\n\n### SUMMARY OF ALL CHANGES\n\n| # | Change | Status |\n|---|--------|--------|\n| 1 | Add baseline-expectation question after Preface | Broadly supported |\n| 2 | Defer Q4 (\"experience vs. argument\") to Part 2 only | Strong majority |\n| 3 | Split engagement/pacing into Q5a + Q5b | Broadly supported |\n| 4 | \"Stayed with you / didn't land\" replaces \"best/worst\" | Majority (1 mild dissent) |\n| 5 | Request marginal notes before per-essay questions | Broadly supported (revised framing) |\n| 6 | NO essay-specific per-essay questions | Unanimous |\n| 7 | Expand Critical Experiential Checks from 3 to 8 probes | Strong consensus |\n| 8 | Internal flag: watch Essay 5→6 transition | Informational |\n\n---\n\n**Please respond with APPROVE, APPROVE WITH AMENDMENT, or OBJECT for each revision (or for the plan as a whole).
