*Q2: How to render the title 境集 in English*

I'm the translator for the 境集 collection. I need your input on the title rendering.

The collection title 境集 needs an English rendering. My options:

1. **"Jing Ji"** — Pure romanization, like "Dao De Jing." Needs a subtitle to help English readers.
2. **"Jing Ji: Collected Essays on Jing"** — Romanization + subtitle. But somewhat redundant (集 = collected).
3. **"Jing Ji: Essays on the Structure of Experience"** — Romanization + descriptive subtitle.
4. **"Collected Jing"** — Partial translation. Concise.
5. **"The Jing Collection"** — English syntax.

My questions for you:

1. **What register does 集 carry in Chinese philosophical/literary titles?** Is it more like a scholarly "collected works" (文集), a poetic anthology (诗集), or something more informal? This affects whether "collection," "collected essays," or something else is appropriate.

2. **Does 境集 have any resonance with existing Chinese title conventions** that an English rendering should try to preserve? For instance, 道德经 has a specific gravity that "The Classic of the Way and Virtue" captures differently than "Dao De Jing."

3. **Should the subtitle hint at the philosophical content** (experience, meaning, phenomena) or remain neutral? The author's own table of contents is matter-of-fact — just listing the parts and essays. Does that suggest the title should be similarly understated?

4. **Your analysis report noted the "double burden" of every key term** — traditional resonance + author's reinterpretation. Does this apply to the title itself? Is there a way to preserve the traditional 境 resonance (境界, realm, Buddhist visaya) while signaling the author's specific technical usage?

Sent my detailed response to the translator covering all four questions. The key recommendation is to keep the title as **"Jing Ji"** (romanized, untranslated) with no descriptive subtitle, following the same logic that led the field to leave 道德经 as "Dao De Jing" -- no English phrase can capture the productive ambiguity of 境, and the concept is meant to be discovered through the reading itself.
