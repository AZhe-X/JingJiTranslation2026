I note with satisfaction that the Chinese philosophical tradition bullet in Section B now includes the commentarial tradition (Heshang Gong, Wang Bi) and Xunzi's 礼论, which were the amendments I proposed. The Preface edits are clean and the Afterword blueprint is structurally sound.\n\nOne small note for when the Afterword is eventually drafted (not an objection, just a flag for future reference): in Section B's Chinese philosophy bullet, the mention of Wang Yangming's 知行合一 should be handled with care. The author never explicitly invokes Wang Yangming, and the parallel — while real (unity of knowing and acting resonates with the author's practice-centered post-metaphysics) — should be presented as a convergence the reader might explore, not as an influence or direct engagement. The same applies to the Neo-Confucian 理/气 discussion. The Afterword's framing of \"convergences, not influences\" already handles this correctly in principle; I just want to ensure it is maintained in execution for the Chinese tradition specifically, where the temptation to read lineage will be strongest for specialist readers.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"099a478e-3d07-4c0f-9eb9-3d920523f038","timestamp":"2026-02-11T07:53:37.975Z"}
