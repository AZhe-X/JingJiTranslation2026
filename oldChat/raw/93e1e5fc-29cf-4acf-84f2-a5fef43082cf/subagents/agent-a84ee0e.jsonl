It works. Here is my assessment.\n\n## Does the mechanism work?\n\nYes. The -scape suffix in English already carries the right connotations: landscape, seascape, mindscape, soundscape -- all mean \"the structured appearance of X as experienced from a standpoint.\" This is remarkably close to what 境 means for the author.

But check it against the other 境-compounds in the collection:\n\n- **境界**: Does \"boundary-scape\" work? Not really. 境界 in its traditional sense means \"boundary/limit\" or \"level of attainment.\" The author uses 境界 in the 范畴论与境 essay in the traditional sense (\"在语言的境界内\" -- within the bounds of language). Here -scape does not fit; \"bounds\" or \"limits\" is more accurate. This is fine -- 境界 is a traditional term used in its traditional sense, distinct from the author's technical 境.\n\n- **意境**: \"meaning-scape\" or \"mind-scape\"?
