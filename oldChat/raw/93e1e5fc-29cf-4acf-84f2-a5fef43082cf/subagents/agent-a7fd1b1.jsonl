Now please assign an importance weight (0-10) to each factor below. 10 = absolutely essential, 0 = not needed.\n\nScore each of the following:\n\n1. Native-level command of both Chinese and English\n2. Philosophical training (not purely literary)\n3. Literary sensibility (not purely academic)\n4. Category theory / mathematical notation literacy\n5. Experience with register shifts (colloquial ↔ technical ↔ poetic ↔ analytic)\n6. Familiarity with Chinese philosophical translation conventions (how 仁/义/礼/道/德 have been rendered by Legge, Waley, Watson, Graham, Ziporyn, etc.)\n7. Sensitivity to performative/experimental dimensions (experiential sequences as load-bearing content, preserving ordering/pacing/escalation)\n8. Familiarity with Western existentialist/phenomenological translation conventions (standard English for Camus, Heidegger, Husserl, Sartre, Wittgenstein)\n9. Familiarity with Buddhist translation chains (Sanskrit → Chinese → English)\n10. Familiarity with Kantian/transcendental terminology in English\n11. Familiarity with analytic philosophy of language register (Anscombe, Brandom, etc.)\n\nPlease respond with just your scores, e.g.:\n1: 10, 2: 9, 3: 8, ... etc.\n\nBrief justification for any score you give below 5 or above 9 is welcome but not required. Keep it concise.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"df9bae40-e93f-4f88-ad25-f1ae9d5e7ca2","timestamp":"2026-02-10T21:40:56.411Z"}
