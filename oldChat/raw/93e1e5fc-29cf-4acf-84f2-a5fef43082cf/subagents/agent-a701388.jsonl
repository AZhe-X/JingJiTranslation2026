The nihilism-as-consequence sentence, even though it is more of a framing claim than an experiential payoff, still pre-interprets the relationship between Essays 4 and 5 in a way that the reader could discover on their own. The replacement (\"The three essays of Part 1 examine, respectively, collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity...\") achieves the same orienting function more cleanly.
