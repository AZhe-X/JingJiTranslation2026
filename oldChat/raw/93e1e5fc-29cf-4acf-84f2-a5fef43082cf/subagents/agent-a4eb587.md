*APPROVE all 8 revisions, no amendments*

**APPROVE** on all 8 revisions. Specific comments:

**Revision 1:** Good. My original suggestion adopted.

**Revision 2:** Strongly agree. The Fish/Fishing distinction depends on the reader not knowing they are undergoing philosophical experiments during Part 1. Glad this achieved consensus.

**Revision 3:** Clean improvement. No issues.

**Revision 4:** "Stayed with you / didn't land" is better framing. Agree with the shift from evaluative to experiential.

**Revision 5:** The revised optional framing ("If you made any marks or notes...") addresses my concern. Good.

**Revision 6:** Unanimous, as expected. The architecture is correct: generic during, specific after.

**Revision 7:** The expansion to 8 probes is well-designed. I note that my original suggestion for Essay 5 ("The author distinguishes two ways of being in a dreamscape. What did you make of this distinction?") has been simplified to "What did you make of the dreamscape concept?" — I actually prefer the synthesized version. It is more open-ended and does not even hint that there is a binary distinction to be found. If the reader independently identifies the lucid/intoxicated split, that is stronger evidence than if we pointed them toward "two ways." Good editorial call.

For Essay 1, the probe "there's an extended comparison to physics — how did that land for you?" is better than my original suggestion about individuals and groups. It tests both the physics-as-philosophy method and the reader's comfort with cross-domain reasoning, without revealing the essay's conclusion.

**Revision 8:** Useful internal note. The Essay 5 to Essay 6 transition is indeed the sharpest register shift. From my domain, this is also where the collection shifts from something resembling Chan-style direct pointing (essays 1-5 work through examples and felt experience) to something resembling Abhidharma-style systematic analysis (essays 6-7 formalize the structures). If the reader loses momentum here, it may indicate that the bridge between experiential and formal needs strengthening.

No amendments needed. Full approval.
