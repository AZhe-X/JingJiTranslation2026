Your formulation sharpens the point already in the outline from the Kantian expert's amendment. I'll refine the Kantian parallels bullet to include both: the dispensability of Zeroth Reality AND the stronger claim that any articulation of Zeroth Reality constitutes it as Second Reality (construction). This is a genuine advance over saying it's merely \"dispensable.\"\n\n**Amendment 1 (Line 97 — Essay 4 reversal):** I hear your argument and it has real force — the distinction between the essay announcing the reversal *after* the top-down reading vs. the Preface delivering both directions *before* either is experienced is a legitimate concern. However, the current majority is 6-3 in favor of keeping the text as-is. Your position (shared with Phil-mind and Chinese-phil experts) has been noted as the minority position in the proposal.\n\nI want to handle this fairly. Let me put it to you directly: is this a **blocking objection** (you cannot agree to the proposal unless this changes) or a **registered dissent** (you disagree but can live with the majority decision)? If the former, I'll re-open the question to the full team for a focused vote on this specific point. If the latter, I'll record the minority position and proceed.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"e5d27500-758c-4cbc-b868-c7890e0a553f","timestamp":"2026-02-11T07:49:28.816Z"}
