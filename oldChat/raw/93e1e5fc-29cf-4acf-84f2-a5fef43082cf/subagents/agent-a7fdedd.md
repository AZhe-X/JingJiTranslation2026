*Review Reporting-Protocol, send feedback to editor*

Task: Review the Reporting-Protocol.md (in Standby Reader directory) and send your advice, suggestions, or confirmation to **editor**. 

The file is at: `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Standby Reader/Reporting-Protocol.md`

Read the file, then send your feedback directly to **editor** (not to me). Editor will orchestrate everyone's suggestions and discuss back and forth until a plan is agreed. Use your own judgment throughout.

One suggestion from the project lead to consider: **Should we add essay-specific questions alongside the general per-essay questions?** For example, after Essay 1 we might ask something tailored to what Essay 1 does, after Essay 2 something tailored to Essay 2, etc. — not just the same generic template for every essay. Think about whether this would be valuable, what those questions might look like, and whether they risk priming the reader (the same concern that led us to extract this file in the first place).

Send your feedback to **editor** when ready.

Let me read the Reporting Protocol file first.

Good. Let me also quickly check the reader's Profile to understand what they see at spawn, so my feedback is informed by the full picture.

Now let me think through this carefully before sending feedback to the editor.

The protocol is well-structured. The key question from the team lead is whether to add essay-specific questions alongside the general per-essay template. Let me think about the priming risk, the value of targeted questions, and where the line should be drawn.

Feedback sent to the editor. Here is a summary of my four recommendations:

1. **Remove a subtle prime from the per-essay template.** The question "Did you feel like the essay was asking you to *experience* something?" tells the reader the collection has an experiential dimension before they discover it themselves. Move it to the full-collection retrospective instead.

2. **Yes to essay-specific questions, but with three strict constraints:** backward-looking only (never hint at what is coming), experiential not analytical (ask "what happened to you"), and limited to 1-2 per essay. I proposed specific questions for all 8 essays, each designed to test the distinctive experiential payload without naming it.

3. **Add a Preface expectation-baseline question** ("What do you expect the collection to be like?") so we can later measure whether the collection matched, exceeded, or confounded expectations.

4. **Keep all other structure as-is** -- the five-stage temporal design and the Critical Experiential Checks placement are well-designed.
