Make your case, respond to the other positions, and see if you can reach consensus. Is the pejorative connotation of \"intoxicated\" a feature (the author IS describing a state of unknowing) or a bug (the author is not morally condemning pre-metaphysical existence)?\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"747bc672-e037-46fc-a184-f54eaeac5516","timestamp":"2026-02-11T00:37:44.750Z"}

Intoxication is not morally bad -- it is a state where certain cognitive capacities (meta-awareness, critical distance) are diminished while others (immersive engagement, emotional intensity) are heightened.
