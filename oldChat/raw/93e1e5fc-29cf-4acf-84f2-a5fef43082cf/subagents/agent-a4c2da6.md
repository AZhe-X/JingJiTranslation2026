*Acknowledged feedback, noted sequential delivery proposal*

Thanks — your feedback aligns strongly with the compiled plan. Key points:

**Already incorporated:**
- NO essay-specific per-essay questions: You're in the majority (5 NO vs 3 YES with constraints). Plan puts all essay-specific probing in Critical Checks at end.
- Essay 5 and Essay 1 Critical Checks: Both in the expanded checks (you're the 8th independent proposal for Essay 5).
- Q4 softening: Incorporated (epistemology-expert's wording, which is close to yours).
- "Tell a friend" prompts: Unchanged.

**New proposal I'm noting:**
- **Sequential delivery of Critical Experiential Checks:** This is an excellent point not raised by anyone else. If we deliver all 8 probes at once, the reader sees the full set and can construct a retrospective narrative across essays. Delivering them one at a time (Essay 1 first, wait for response, then Essay 2, etc.) preserves the independence of each report. I'll flag this for the next iteration — it's a delivery-mechanism change, not a content change, but it matters methodologically.

Standing by per team lead's instructions. Thanks.

Good — the editor has acknowledged the pipeline and noted the sequential delivery point for Critical Experiential Checks. That's a methodological refinement worth incorporating.

Let me update the Reporting Protocol to capture this delivery mechanism note, since the editor flagged it as worth recording.

The editor's point about sequential delivery is a methodological improvement. The protocol currently says "Deliver ONLY after the final prompts are submitted" but doesn't specify whether the 8 probes should be delivered all at once or one at a time. Since the protocol is marked FINAL, I should add this as a delivery-mechanism note rather than changing the content. Let me add it to the Important block.

The edit was denied. The protocol is marked FINAL — the user may be protecting it from changes. This is the right outcome; the protocol has team consensus. I should note this as a pending refinement rather than editing the locked document.

The project is in a holding pattern while translator-2 works on Task #29 (Essay 4 passage revision). I see some new in-progress tasks (#32, #33) for chinese-phil-expert and chinese-phil-expert-2 that I didn't create — these may be expert consultation threads spawned by the translator's work.

Let me check on the status of Task #29 and the new tasks to understand what's happening.

Tasks #32 and #33 appear to be expert agent threads that were spawned — likely for handling consultation questions. Task #29 is in progress, which means translator-2 is working on the Essay 4 revision.

The project is proceeding as planned. Nothing requires my intervention right now — the translator is working on the assigned revision, and expert consultation threads are active. I'll wait for translator-2 to complete Task #29 or for any team member to send a message requiring direction.
