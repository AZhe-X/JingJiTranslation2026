The Author's Analysis of Justified True Belief in \"A Thought on Knowledge\"\n     8→\n     9→\"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay #2) is the most directly epistemological text in the collection. The author, Xueqi Li, undertakes a systematic deconstruction of the classical tripartite definition of knowledge as Justified True Belief (JTB). The analysis is notable for its methodological orientation: rather than engaging with the standard post-Gettier literature directly, the author asks a prior question -- *why do we discuss knowledge this way at all?*\n    10→\n    11→### Relation to Gettier Problems\n    12→\n    13→The author does not explicitly name Gettier, but the essay implicitly renders Gettier problems moot. Gettier cases show that JTB is insufficient for knowledge by constructing scenarios where one has justified true belief but not knowledge. The author's argument goes further: the truth condition is not merely insufficient but *methodologically inaccessible*. If we can never verify our beliefs against objective truth (we can only check against phenomena or other beliefs), then the entire apparatus that generates Gettier problems -- the gap between justification-plus-truth and genuine knowledge -- dissolves. Gettier problems presuppose that truth is a meaningful independent condition that can accidentally coincide with justification; the author argues that from the epistemic agent's standpoint, truth never enters the picture at all. This is a more radical move than most post-Gettier responses.\n    14→\n    15→### Relation to Foundationalism\n    16→\n    17→The author engages foundationalism directly, though not by name. The analysis of justification starting points identifies three possible bases: phenomena, justified beliefs, or truth. The author then argues:\n    18→- Truth-based starting points collapse into phenomena or belief in practice (we never access truth directly).\n    19→- Phenomena-based starting points require \"digestion\" (conversion into thought), which makes them functionally belief-based.\n    20→- Therefore all justification reduces to justified belief.\n    21→\n    22→This creates a devastating dilemma for foundationalism: if all justification is belief-based, then either (a) there are unjustified foundational beliefs (undermining foundationalism's claim that basic beliefs are justified), or (b) justification is circular. The author's treatment of circular justification in the sidenote (\"The other option: circular justified beliefs\") is particularly inventive -- arguing that accepting circularity leads to the absurd conclusion that babies must possess knowledge, requiring either instantaneous simultaneous justification, infinite chains of before-lives, or circular lives. This reductio is original and effective.\n    23→\n    24→### Relation to Coherentism\n    25→\n    26→The author's argument that justification reduces to belief-about-belief structurally resembles coherentism (knowledge is justified by coherence with a system of beliefs). However, the author does not embrace coherentism as a solution. Instead, the reduction to belief is presented as revealing that knowledge *just is* belief -- \"what each individual believes to be correct.\" The coherentist's web of beliefs is acknowledged but treated as the only thing that exists, rather than as a theory of justification that preserves a meaningful distinction between knowledge and mere belief.\n    27→\n    28→### Relation to Reliabilism\n    29→\n    30→The sidenote on \"Examples of justification bases\" explicitly lists \"Reliable processes\" as one category of justification base, classifying it as \"phenomena or truth.\" The author's key argument applies: whatever reliable processes are in themselves, what matters is *how we access them*. A reliable process must manifest as a phenomenon or be converted into belief to serve as a starting point for justification. This effectively neutralizes reliabilism's externalist move: even if a belief is produced by a reliable process, the epistemic agent can only use this fact insofar as it enters their phenomenal experience or belief system.\n    31→\n    32→---\n    33→\n    34→## 2. The Argument that Justification Reduces to Belief\n    35→\n    36→This is the central epistemological thesis of \"A Thought on Knowledge\" and arguably the most significant philosophical claim in the collection from an epistemological standpoint.\n    37→\n    38→The argument proceeds in three steps:\n    39→\n    40→1. **Truth-based justification collapses**: We have no direct access to truth; we access only phenomena. The rain example is instructive -- to verify \"it is raining outside,\" we look outside, but we only obtain the phenomenon of potential rain (we might be deceived by a sprinkler). Therefore, truth-based starting points are, in practice, phenomena-based or belief-based.\n    41→\n    42→2. **Phenomena-based justification collapses**: Phenomena require \"digestion\" -- conversion into thought -- before they can serve as justification bases. The three Bob examples brilliantly illustrate this: (a) Bob uses a memory-based belief to reject a claim; (b) Bob looks outside but, deceived by a sprinkler, still relies on interpretation; (c) Bob sees rain but, absorbed in emotional reverie, does not form the belief \"it is raining\" at all. The third case is especially powerful: it shows that phenomena do not automatically become justification bases; they require active cognitive processing.\n    43→\n    44→3. **Therefore, all justification is belief-based**: Justification based on justified belief is \"a second order of belief (belief about belief).\"\n    45→\n    46→The implications are radical:\n    47→- **The truth condition is vacuous**: \"In practice, the only thing that exists is 'what each individual believes to be correct.'\"\n    48→- **Knowledge is belief**: The distinction between knowledge and belief collapses in practice.\n    49→- **Agrippa's Trilemma is resolved by accepting the first horn**: Knowledge bottoms out in unjustified belief, but this is not a deficiency -- it is simply how cognition works.\n    50→\n    51→This has significant implications for epistemology as a discipline. If knowledge is just belief, then epistemology's traditional project of distinguishing knowledge from mere belief is misconceived. The productive questions become: What standards do communities use to evaluate beliefs? How do those standards change? What is their utility? The author gestures toward this in the \"Knowledge in motion\" sidenote, where the Standard Model in physics is presented as the winning belief-system according to the standard of predictive success.\n    52→\n    53→---\n    54→\n    55→## 3. The \"Access\" Argument\n    56→\n    57→The sidenote titled \"Access\" and the discussion of justification bases contain what I consider one of the essay's most philosophically important moves: the shift from asking *what justification bases are* to asking *how we access them*.\n    58→\n    59→> \"The key point is that for each justification basis, we must think about how we access it, instead of what is it. Things that are not accessible cannot be used as a starting point in practical justification.\"\n    60→\n    61→This is a methodological principle with far-reaching consequences. It applies uniformly across all proposed justification bases:\n    62→\n    63→- **Evidence**: If evidence is \"truth,\" it must be accessed through phenomena; if phenomena, it must be digested into belief.\n    64→- **A priori justification**: Must manifest through shaping phenomena we experience.\n    65→- **Innate cognitive structures**: \"manifest only through shaping phenomena we experience, thus phenomenon-based in practice.\"\n    66→- **Reliable processes**: Must be accessible as phenomena or truth, which in turn collapse into belief.\n    67→- **Testimony**: Known through phenomena (hearing someone speak, reading a text).\n    68→- **Mathematical/logical principles**: In practice, accessed as justified beliefs (the sidenote \"Access to truth\" in mathematics is devastating: mathematicians prove things from starting points \"taken to be true\" using methods \"taken to be true\").\n    69→\n    70→The access argument is essentially a *methodological phenomenalism* applied to epistemology. It does not claim that nothing exists beyond phenomena (that would be ontological phenomenalism); it claims that nothing beyond phenomena can function as a starting point for justification *in practice*. This is why the author repeatedly emphasizes \"in practice\" and \"in real life.\"\n    71→\n    72→The philosophical significance is that this argument is largely framework-independent. It does not depend on any particular metaphysical commitments. Whether you are a realist, idealist, or pragmatist, you must still answer the question: how does your preferred justification base enter the justification process? And the author argues that the answer is always: through phenomena, which are then digested into belief.\n    73→\n    74→This connects directly to the later essays' use of P (phenomenon/现象) as the \"first reality\" (第一实在). The epistemological access argument provides the groundwork for the metaphysical framework developed in \"后形而上学 整理\" (Essay #4).\n    75→\n    76→---\n    77→\n    78→## 4. The K1 Strategy's Model of Knowledge Formation (知识的发生)\n    79→\n    80→The K1 strategy essay (Essay #7) develops a formal categorical model of how knowledge arises. The section \"知识的发生\" (the genesis/occurrence of knowledge) is a remarkable attempt to formalize epistemological processes using category theory.\n    81→\n    82→### The Knowledge Category\n    83→\n    84→The author defines $(\\mathcal{E}_K)_t$ as the knowledge structure at time $t$. Objects are beliefs; morphisms are justification relations (证实关系). Crucially, the author notes that justification relations are themselves beliefs -- \"what we accept as valid argumentation\" -- maintaining consistency with the reduction of justification to belief from \"A Thought on Knowledge.\"\n    85→\n    86→### The Formation Process\n    87→\n    88→Knowledge formation proceeds through a functor:\n    89→$$\n    90→(F_{L \\to K})_t: (\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\to (\\mathcal{E}_K)_t\n    91→$$\n    92→\n    93→This maps linguistic structures to knowledge structures. The process:\n    94→\n    95→1. Through language games, a new sentence $a$ is constructed in the language category $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$.\n    96→2. Introspection (via the functor $(F_{L \\to K})_t$) maps this sentence to a belief in the knowledge network.\n    97→3. The knowledge category evolves: the new belief is either accepted or rejected based on whether it preserves the stable structure $S_K$.\n    98→4. When $a$'s corresponding belief becomes an object in the evolved $(\\mathcal{E}_K)_{t'}$, \"knowledge has occurred\" (知识就发生了).\n    99→\n   100→This is epistemologically significant for several reasons:\n   101→\n   102→- **Knowledge is processual**: Knowledge is not a static state but an event -- it \"occurs\" (发生) through the evolution of categorical structures.\n   103→- **Language precedes knowledge**: Language games generate candidate beliefs that are then filtered through the knowledge structure. This aligns with later Wittgenstein but gives it formal structure.\n   104→- **The knowledge structure is self-regulating**: Acceptance/rejection is determined by compatibility with the existing stable structure $S_K$, which is a form of coherentism but formalized categorically.\n   105→- **Even rejection causes perturbation**: \"Even rejection may cause perturbation to the knowledge network\" -- this is a subtle and important point. Failed knowledge claims still affect the epistemic structure.\n   106→\n   107→### The Role of E_t\n   108→\n   109→The functor $(F_{L \\to K})_t$ may factor through the total experiential category $\\mathbb{E}_t$:\n   110→$$\n   111→(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,L})_t} \\mathbb{E}_t \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,K})_{t+1}^{-1}} (\\mathcal{E}_K)_{t+2}\n   112→$$\n   113→\n   114→This means knowledge formation passes through the full experiential field. The stable structure $S_E$ of experience constrains what can become knowledge. This is a formal expression of the idea that knowledge is shaped by (and shapes) our broader experiential life.\n   115→\n   116→---\n   117→\n   118→## 5. The Stable Structure S_K and Its Epistemological Significance\n   119→\n   120→The concept of stable structures preserved under evolution is perhaps the most original contribution of the K1 strategy to epistemology.\n   121→\n   122→### Definition and Nature\n   123→\n   124→$S_K$ is defined as a structure within $(\\mathcal{E}_K)_t$ that is preserved across the evolution $T$. It is what remains invariant as the knowledge category evolves through the addition and rejection of beliefs.\n   125→\n   126→### Epistemological Significance\n   127→\n   128→1. **A priori structures**: The author explicitly connects $S_E$ (the stable structure of the total experiential category) to the possibility of \"a priori cognitive structures.\" If one takes $\\mathbb{E}_{t_c}$ at the earliest moment of cognitive life, then $S_{E_c}$ (the stable structure at that point) could be identified with innate cognitive structures. If some part of $S_E$ is necessary for constructing any $\\mathbb{E}_t$ from phenomena $\\mathfrak{P}_t$, that part can be called a \"cognitive structure\" (认知结构). This is a formalization of something close to Kant's categories, but arrived at through categorical evolution rather than transcendental deduction.\n   129→\n   130→2. **Grammar and logic as stable structures**: The author notes that in the language category $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$, the stable structure corresponds to \"things like grammatical rules.\" This suggests that grammar, logic, and similar formal structures are epistemologically fundamental not because they are a priori truths, but because they are *evolutionarily stable* in the categorical sense.\n   131→\n   132→3. **Indirect access through language games**: Since $S_E$ is difficult to study directly, the K1 strategy proposes studying $S_L$ (the stable structure of language) and using the functor $(F_{E,L})_t$ to approximate $S_E$:\n   133→$$\n   134→(F_{E,L})_t(S_L) \\approx S_E\n   135→$$\n   136→This provides a methodological justification for linguistic analysis in epistemology -- a formal grounding for the \"linguistic turn.\"\n   137→\n   138→4. **Cross-domain convergence**: By studying multiple sub-categories (language, mathematics, etc.) and their respective stable structures, we can triangulate toward $S_E$. This is methodologically powerful: it suggests that philosophical progress comes from examining the same experiential structure through multiple formal lenses.\n   139→\n   140→5. **Descriptive, not normative**: The author carefully notes that these stable structures are descriptive. Whether they carry metaphysical or normative weight is left open. This is epistemological modesty of the right kind.\n   141→\n   142→---\n   143→\n   144→## 6. The Meno Paradox Resolution\n   145→\n   146→The Meno paradox -- if you don't know what you're looking for, how will you recognize it when you find it? If you already know, why search? -- receives a structural resolution in the K1 strategy's framework (in the KA猜想 section).\n   147→\n   148→The resolution proceeds:\n   149→1. When we cannot obtain the $\\eta$ feeling (the experience of alignment between a structure's evolution and our experiential evolution), we sense that we don't fully understand something.\n   150→2. This failure may be due to gaps in the network (missing paths/morphisms) or due to \"tension\" (张力) -- an inability to organize the network to achieve a universal property.\n   151→3. We therefore know \"the thing I need to learn\" exists as a structural gap or unresolved tension -- it is \"not something I have already learned\" but something whose *structural position* is partially determined by the existing network.\n   152→4. When, through reorganizing morphisms or acquiring new concepts, the network forms a universal property and we obtain $\\eta$, \"we feel we have learned the thing we previously wanted to learn.\"\n   153→\n   154→This is elegant because it resolves the paradox without positing any mysterious pre-knowledge. What we \"know\" before learning is not the content of what we will learn, but the *structural signature of its absence* -- the gaps and tensions in our current knowledge network. The object of inquiry is defined negatively, by the shape of what is missing. This is reminiscent of Polanyi's \"tacit knowledge\" but given precise categorical form.\n   155→\n   156→From a translation perspective, the phrase \"知识的发生\" is epistemologically loaded. \"发生\" means \"to happen/occur/arise\" and carries connotations of emergence and genesis. \"The occurrence of knowledge\" or \"the genesis of knowledge\" are both possibilities, but neither fully captures the dynamic, event-like quality the author intends.\n   157→\n   158→---\n   159→\n   160→## 7. Translation Challenges for Epistemological Terms\n   161→\n   162→### Core Terms\n   163→\n   164→1. **知识 (zhishi)**: Straightforwardly \"knowledge,\" but the author's analysis shows that what is usually called 知识 in Chinese is closer to \"what is believed to be correct\" than to the philosophical technical term \"knowledge\" (JTB). A translator should note this tension.\n   165→\n   166→2. **信念 (xinnian)**: \"Belief\" -- but in Chinese philosophical usage, 信念 carries stronger connotations of conviction or commitment than the English epistemological use of \"belief\" (which can be very weak, as in \"I believe it might rain\"). The author's use in the formal framework is closer to the English technical sense.\n   167→\n   168→3. **证实关系 (zhengshi guanxi)**: \"Justification relation\" or \"verification relation.\" The Chinese 证实 can mean both \"justify\" and \"verify/confirm,\" and the author seems to intend both senses simultaneously. In the K1 framework, these are morphisms in the knowledge category -- they are the *connections* between beliefs that constitute epistemic structure. \"Epistemic linkage\" might capture the structural sense better, but loses the justificatory connotation.\n   169→\n   170→4. **现象 (xianxiang)**: \"Phenomena\" -- but the author's usage is closer to the phenomenological sense (what is given in experience) than the scientific sense (observable events). The sidenote explicitly clarifies: \"it refers to what we experience or observe.\" The translation should preserve this experiential emphasis.\n   171→\n   172→5. **第一实在 (di-yi shizai)**: \"First reality\" -- a term coined by the author to denote phenomena as the epistemological starting point. The footnote clarifies this is not an ontological claim about what is \"really real\" but a methodological claim about what is epistemically primary. \"Primary actuality\" or \"first actuality\" might work, though \"first reality\" is more natural.\n   173→\n   174→6. **知识的发生 (zhishi de fasheng)**: \"The occurrence/genesis of knowledge\" -- as noted above, this is a key phrase. \"Knowledge formation\" loses the event-character; \"the happening of knowledge\" is awkward but more faithful; \"knowledge emergence\" adds connotations of emergence theory that may not be intended.\n   175→\n   176→7. **稳定结构 (wending jiegou)**: \"Stable structure\" -- straightforward, but in the epistemological context, it functions as the author's replacement for concepts like \"a priori categories,\" \"cognitive frameworks,\" or \"epistemic norms.\" The translation should preserve its structural/mathematical character rather than assimilating it to existing philosophical vocabulary.\n   177→\n   178→8. **境 (jing)**: This is the collection's central term and the hardest to translate. In the epistemological context, it functions as \"the categorical structure over phenomena\" -- the organized experiential field within which knowledge operates. \"Sphere\" captures the boundedness; \"realm\" the experiential quality; \"field\" the structural aspect. None is fully adequate. I recommend preserving 境 as a technical term (Jing) with explanation, as its meaning is constituted by the entire theoretical framework.\n   179→\n   180→### Structural Challenges\n   181→\n   182→The author moves fluidly between colloquial Chinese, formal philosophical Chinese, and mathematical notation. The epistemological arguments in \"A Thought on Knowledge\" are written in accessible English, while the K1 strategy's epistemological sections are in Chinese with heavy mathematical formalism. A translator must navigate:\n   183→\n   184→- The shift from everyday examples (rain, Bob) to formal categorical structures\n   185→- The author's deliberate avoidance of standard philosophical terminology (the author often coins terms rather than using established philosophical Chinese, and explicitly warns readers about this in Essay #4)\n   186→- The interplay between Chinese philosophical concepts (道德仁义礼) and Western epistemological frameworks\n   187→- Mathematical notation that carries philosophical meaning (functors as \"introspection,\" morphisms as \"justification relations\")\n   188→\n   189→---\n   190→\n   191→## 8. Overall Significance for Epistemology\n   192→\n   193→### What Is Achieved\n   194→\n   195→1. **A practice-first epistemology**: The author consistently asks \"what happens in practice?\" rather than \"what is conceptually possible?\" This is not mere pragmatism -- it is a principled methodological stance grounded in the access argument. Knowledge is analyzed as it actually functions in human cognitive life, not as an idealized abstract relation.\n   196→\n   197→2. **The dissolution of the JTB framework**: The author does not add a fourth condition to JTB (as in most post-Gettier epistemology) or reject one condition. Instead, the author shows that truth and justification both reduce to belief in practice, making the tripartite analysis a distinction without a difference. This is more radical than most contemporary epistemological positions.\n   198→\n   199→3. **A formal framework for epistemic dynamics**: The K1 strategy provides what analytic epistemology has largely lacked: a formal model of how knowledge *changes over time*. The evolution functor $T$, the stable structures $S_K$, and the natural transformation $\\eta$ provide precise tools for analyzing epistemic processes.

The Author's Analysis of Justified True Belief in \"A Thought on Knowledge\"\n\n\"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay #2) is the most directly epistemological text in the collection. The author, Xueqi Li, undertakes a systematic deconstruction of the classical tripartite definition of knowledge as Justified True Belief (JTB). The analysis is notable for its methodological orientation: rather than engaging with the standard post-Gettier literature directly, the author asks a prior question -- *why do we discuss knowledge this way at all?*\n\n### Relation to Gettier Problems\n\nThe author does not explicitly name Gettier, but the essay implicitly renders Gettier problems moot. Gettier cases show that JTB is insufficient for knowledge by constructing scenarios where one has justified true belief but not knowledge. The author's argument goes further: the truth condition is not merely insufficient but *methodologically inaccessible*. If we can never verify our beliefs against objective truth (we can only check against phenomena or other beliefs), then the entire apparatus that generates Gettier problems -- the gap between justification-plus-truth and genuine knowledge -- dissolves. Gettier problems presuppose that truth is a meaningful independent condition that can accidentally coincide with justification; the author argues that from the epistemic agent's standpoint, truth never enters the picture at all. This is a more radical move than most post-Gettier responses.\n\n### Relation to Foundationalism\n\nThe author engages foundationalism directly, though not by name. The analysis of justification starting points identifies three possible bases: phenomena, justified beliefs, or truth. The author then argues:\n- Truth-based starting points collapse into phenomena or belief in practice (we never access truth directly).\n- Phenomena-based starting points require \"digestion\" (conversion into thought), which makes them functionally belief-based.\n- Therefore all justification reduces to justified belief.\n\nThis creates a devastating dilemma for foundationalism: if all justification is belief-based, then either (a) there are unjustified foundational beliefs (undermining foundationalism's claim that basic beliefs are justified), or (b) justification is circular. The author's treatment of circular justification in the sidenote (\"The other option: circular justified beliefs\") is particularly inventive -- arguing that accepting circularity leads to the absurd conclusion that babies must possess knowledge, requiring either instantaneous simultaneous justification, infinite chains of before-lives, or circular lives. This reductio is original and effective.\n\n### Relation to Coherentism\n\nThe author's argument that justification reduces to belief-about-belief structurally resembles coherentism (knowledge is justified by coherence with a system of beliefs). However, the author does not embrace coherentism as a solution. Instead, the reduction to belief is presented as revealing that knowledge *just is* belief -- \"what each individual believes to be correct.\" The coherentist's web of beliefs is acknowledged but treated as the only thing that exists, rather than as a theory of justification that preserves a meaningful distinction between knowledge and mere belief.\n\n### Relation to Reliabilism\n\nThe sidenote on \"Examples of justification bases\" explicitly lists \"Reliable processes\" as one category of justification base, classifying it as \"phenomena or truth.\" The author's key argument applies: whatever reliable processes are in themselves, what matters is *how we access them*. A reliable process must manifest as a phenomenon or be converted into belief to serve as a starting point for justification. This effectively neutralizes reliabilism's externalist move: even if a belief is produced by a reliable process, the epistemic agent can only use this fact insofar as it enters their phenomenal experience or belief system.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Argument that Justification Reduces to Belief\n\nThis is the central epistemological thesis of \"A Thought on Knowledge\" and arguably the most significant philosophical claim in the collection from an epistemological standpoint.\n\nThe argument proceeds in three steps:\n\n1. **Truth-based justification collapses**: We have no direct access to truth; we access only phenomena. The rain example is instructive -- to verify \"it is raining outside,\" we look outside, but we only obtain the phenomenon of potential rain (we might be deceived by a sprinkler). Therefore, truth-based starting points are, in practice, phenomena-based or belief-based.\n\n2. **Phenomena-based justification collapses**: Phenomena require \"digestion\" -- conversion into thought -- before they can serve as justification bases. The three Bob examples brilliantly illustrate this: (a) Bob uses a memory-based belief to reject a claim; (b) Bob looks outside but, deceived by a sprinkler, still relies on interpretation; (c) Bob sees rain but, absorbed in emotional reverie, does not form the belief \"it is raining\" at all. The third case is especially powerful: it shows that phenomena do not automatically become justification bases; they require active cognitive processing.\n\n3. **Therefore, all justification is belief-based**: Justification based on justified belief is \"a second order of belief (belief about belief).\"\n\nThe implications are radical:\n- **The truth condition is vacuous**: \"In practice, the only thing that exists is 'what each individual believes to be correct.'\"\n- **Knowledge is belief**: The distinction between knowledge and belief collapses in practice.\n- **Agrippa's Trilemma is resolved by accepting the first horn**: Knowledge bottoms out in unjustified belief, but this is not a deficiency -- it is simply how cognition works.\n\nThis has significant implications for epistemology as a discipline. If knowledge is just belief, then epistemology's traditional project of distinguishing knowledge from mere belief is misconceived. The productive questions become: What standards do communities use to evaluate beliefs? How do those standards change? What is their utility? The author gestures toward this in the \"Knowledge in motion\" sidenote, where the Standard Model in physics is presented as the winning belief-system according to the standard of predictive success.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The \"Access\" Argument\n\nThe sidenote titled \"Access\" and the discussion of justification bases contain what I consider one of the essay's most philosophically important moves: the shift from asking *what justification bases are* to asking *how we access them*.\n\n> \"The key point is that for each justification basis, we must think about how we access it, instead of what is it. Things that are not accessible cannot be used as a starting point in practical justification.\"\n\nThis is a methodological principle with far-reaching consequences. It applies uniformly across all proposed justification bases:\n\n- **Evidence**: If evidence is \"truth,\" it must be accessed through phenomena; if phenomena, it must be digested into belief.\n- **A priori justification**: Must manifest through shaping phenomena we experience.\n- **Innate cognitive structures**: \"manifest only through shaping phenomena we experience, thus phenomenon-based in practice.\"\n- **Reliable processes**: Must be accessible as phenomena or truth, which in turn collapse into belief.\n- **Testimony**: Known through phenomena (hearing someone speak, reading a text).\n- **Mathematical/logical principles**: In practice, accessed as justified beliefs (the sidenote \"Access to truth\" in mathematics is devastating: mathematicians prove things from starting points \"taken to be true\" using methods \"taken to be true\").\n\nThe access argument is essentially a *methodological phenomenalism* applied to epistemology. It does not claim that nothing exists beyond phenomena (that would be ontological phenomenalism); it claims that nothing beyond phenomena can function as a starting point for justification *in practice*. This is why the author repeatedly emphasizes \"in practice\" and \"in real life.\"\n\nThe philosophical significance is that this argument is largely framework-independent. It does not depend on any particular metaphysical commitments. Whether you are a realist, idealist, or pragmatist, you must still answer the question: how does your preferred justification base enter the justification process? And the author argues that the answer is always: through phenomena, which are then digested into belief.\n\nThis connects directly to the later essays' use of P (phenomenon/现象) as the \"first reality\" (第一实在). The epistemological access argument provides the groundwork for the metaphysical framework developed in \"后形而上学 整理\" (Essay #4).\n\n---\n\n## 4. The K1 Strategy's Model of Knowledge Formation (知识的发生)\n\nThe K1 strategy essay (Essay #7) develops a formal categorical model of how knowledge arises. The section \"知识的发生\" (the genesis/occurrence of knowledge) is a remarkable attempt to formalize epistemological processes using category theory.\n\n### The Knowledge Category\n\nThe author defines $(\\mathcal{E}_K)_t$ as the knowledge structure at time $t$. Objects are beliefs; morphisms are justification relations (证实关系). Crucially, the author notes that justification relations are themselves beliefs -- \"what we accept as valid argumentation\" -- maintaining consistency with the reduction of justification to belief from \"A Thought on Knowledge.\"\n\n### The Formation Process\n\nKnowledge formation proceeds through a functor:\n$$\n(F_{L \\to K})_t: (\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\to (\\mathcal{E}_K)_t\n$$\n\nThis maps linguistic structures to knowledge structures. The process:\n\n1. Through language games, a new sentence $a$ is constructed in the language category $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$.\n2. Introspection (via the functor $(F_{L \\to K})_t$) maps this sentence to a belief in the knowledge network.\n3. The knowledge category evolves: the new belief is either accepted or rejected based on whether it preserves the stable structure $S_K$.\n4. When $a$'s corresponding belief becomes an object in the evolved $(\\mathcal{E}_K)_{t'}$, \"knowledge has occurred\" (知识就发生了).\n\nThis is epistemologically significant for several reasons:\n\n- **Knowledge is processual**: Knowledge is not a static state but an event -- it \"occurs\" (发生) through the evolution of categorical structures.\n- **Language precedes knowledge**: Language games generate candidate beliefs that are then filtered through the knowledge structure. This aligns with later Wittgenstein but gives it formal structure.\n- **The knowledge structure is self-regulating**: Acceptance/rejection is determined by compatibility with the existing stable structure $S_K$, which is a form of coherentism but formalized categorically.\n- **Even rejection causes perturbation**: \"Even rejection may cause perturbation to the knowledge network\" -- this is a subtle and important point. Failed knowledge claims still affect the epistemic structure.\n\n### The Role of E_t\n\nThe functor $(F_{L \\to K})_t$ may factor through the total experiential category $\\mathbb{E}_t$:\n$$\n(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,L})_t} \\mathbb{E}_t \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,K})_{t+1}^{-1}} (\\mathcal{E}_K)_{t+2}\n$$\n\nThis means knowledge formation passes through the full experiential field. The stable structure $S_E$ of experience constrains what can become knowledge. This is a formal expression of the idea that knowledge is shaped by (and shapes) our broader experiential life.\n\n---\n\n## 5. The Stable Structure S_K and Its Epistemological Significance\n\nThe concept of stable structures preserved under evolution is perhaps the most original contribution of the K1 strategy to epistemology.\n\n### Definition and Nature\n\n$S_K$ is defined as a structure within $(\\mathcal{E}_K)_t$ that is preserved across the evolution $T$. It is what remains invariant as the knowledge category evolves through the addition and rejection of beliefs.\n\n### Epistemological Significance\n\n1. **A priori structures**: The author explicitly connects $S_E$ (the stable structure of the total experiential category) to the possibility of \"a priori cognitive structures.\" If one takes $\\mathbb{E}_{t_c}$ at the earliest moment of cognitive life, then $S_{E_c}$ (the stable structure at that point) could be identified with innate cognitive structures. If some part of $S_E$ is necessary for constructing any $\\mathbb{E}_t$ from phenomena $\\mathfrak{P}_t$, that part can be called a \"cognitive structure\" (认知结构). This is a formalization of something close to Kant's categories, but arrived at through categorical evolution rather than transcendental deduction.\n\n2. **Grammar and logic as stable structures**: The author notes that in the language category $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$, the stable structure corresponds to \"things like grammatical rules.\" This suggests that grammar, logic, and similar formal structures are epistemologically fundamental not because they are a priori truths, but because they are *evolutionarily stable* in the categorical sense.\n\n3. **Indirect access through language games**: Since $S_E$ is difficult to study directly, the K1 strategy proposes studying $S_L$ (the stable structure of language) and using the functor $(F_{E,L})_t$ to approximate $S_E$:\n$$\n(F_{E,L})_t(S_L) \\approx S_E\n$$\nThis provides a methodological justification for linguistic analysis in epistemology -- a formal grounding for the \"linguistic turn.\"\n\n4. **Cross-domain convergence**: By studying multiple sub-categories (language, mathematics, etc.) and their respective stable structures, we can triangulate toward $S_E$. This is methodologically powerful: it suggests that philosophical progress comes from examining the same experiential structure through multiple formal lenses.\n\n5. **Descriptive, not normative**: The author carefully notes that these stable structures are descriptive. Whether they carry metaphysical or normative weight is left open. This is epistemological modesty of the right kind.\n\n---\n\n## 6. The Meno Paradox Resolution\n\nThe Meno paradox -- if you don't know what you're looking for, how will you recognize it when you find it? If you already know, why search? -- receives a structural resolution in the K1 strategy's framework (in the KA猜想 section).\n\nThe resolution proceeds:\n1. When we cannot obtain the $\\eta$ feeling (the experience of alignment between a structure's evolution and our experiential evolution), we sense that we don't fully understand something.\n2. This failure may be due to gaps in the network (missing paths/morphisms) or due to \"tension\" (张力) -- an inability to organize the network to achieve a universal property.\n3. We therefore know \"the thing I need to learn\" exists as a structural gap or unresolved tension -- it is \"not something I have already learned\" but something whose *structural position* is partially determined by the existing network.\n4. When, through reorganizing morphisms or acquiring new concepts, the network forms a universal property and we obtain $\\eta$, \"we feel we have learned the thing we previously wanted to learn.\"\n\nThis is elegant because it resolves the paradox without positing any mysterious pre-knowledge. What we \"know\" before learning is not the content of what we will learn, but the *structural signature of its absence* -- the gaps and tensions in our current knowledge network. The object of inquiry is defined negatively, by the shape of what is missing. This is reminiscent of Polanyi's \"tacit knowledge\" but given precise categorical form.\n\nFrom a translation perspective, the phrase \"知识的发生\" is epistemologically loaded. \"发生\" means \"to happen/occur/arise\" and carries connotations of emergence and genesis. \"The occurrence of knowledge\" or \"the genesis of knowledge\" are both possibilities, but neither fully captures the dynamic, event-like quality the author intends.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Translation Challenges for Epistemological Terms\n\n### Core Terms\n\n1. **知识 (zhishi)**: Straightforwardly \"knowledge,\" but the author's analysis shows that what is usually called 知识 in Chinese is closer to \"what is believed to be correct\" than to the philosophical technical term \"knowledge\" (JTB). A translator should note this tension.\n\n2. **信念 (xinnian)**: \"Belief\" -- but in Chinese philosophical usage, 信念 carries stronger connotations of conviction or commitment than the English epistemological use of \"belief\" (which can be very weak, as in \"I believe it might rain\"). The author's use in the formal framework is closer to the English technical sense.\n\n3. **证实关系 (zhengshi guanxi)**: \"Justification relation\" or \"verification relation.\" The Chinese 证实 can mean both \"justify\" and \"verify/confirm,\" and the author seems to intend both senses simultaneously. In the K1 framework, these are morphisms in the knowledge category -- they are the *connections* between beliefs that constitute epistemic structure. \"Epistemic linkage\" might capture the structural sense better, but loses the justificatory connotation.\n\n4. **现象 (xianxiang)**: \"Phenomena\" -- but the author's usage is closer to the phenomenological sense (what is given in experience) than the scientific sense (observable events). The sidenote explicitly clarifies: \"it refers to what we experience or observe.\" The translation should preserve this experiential emphasis.\n\n5. **第一实在 (di-yi shizai)**: \"First reality\" -- a term coined by the author to denote phenomena as the epistemological starting point. The footnote clarifies this is not an ontological claim about what is \"really real\" but a methodological claim about what is epistemically primary. \"Primary actuality\" or \"first actuality\" might work, though \"first reality\" is more natural.\n\n6. **知识的发生 (zhishi de fasheng)**: \"The occurrence/genesis of knowledge\" -- as noted above, this is a key phrase. \"Knowledge formation\" loses the event-character; \"the happening of knowledge\" is awkward but more faithful; \"knowledge emergence\" adds connotations of emergence theory that may not be intended.\n\n7. **稳定结构 (wending jiegou)**: \"Stable structure\" -- straightforward, but in the epistemological context, it functions as the author's replacement for concepts like \"a priori categories,\" \"cognitive frameworks,\" or \"epistemic norms.\" The translation should preserve its structural/mathematical character rather than assimilating it to existing philosophical vocabulary.\n\n8. **境 (jing)**: This is the collection's central term and the hardest to translate. In the epistemological context, it functions as \"the categorical structure over phenomena\" -- the organized experiential field within which knowledge operates. \"Sphere\" captures the boundedness; \"realm\" the experiential quality; \"field\" the structural aspect. None is fully adequate. I recommend preserving 境 as a technical term (Jing) with explanation, as its meaning is constituted by the entire theoretical framework.\n\n### Structural Challenges\n\nThe author moves fluidly between colloquial Chinese, formal philosophical Chinese, and mathematical notation. The epistemological arguments in \"A Thought on Knowledge\" are written in accessible English, while the K1 strategy's epistemological sections are in Chinese with heavy mathematical formalism. A translator must navigate:\n\n- The shift from everyday examples (rain, Bob) to formal categorical structures\n- The author's deliberate avoidance of standard philosophical terminology (the author often coins terms rather than using established philosophical Chinese, and explicitly warns readers about this in Essay #4)\n- The interplay between Chinese philosophical concepts (道德仁义礼) and Western epistemological frameworks\n- Mathematical notation that carries philosophical meaning (functors as \"introspection,\" morphisms as \"justification relations\")\n\n---\n\n## 8. Overall Significance for Epistemology\n\n### What Is Achieved\n\n1. **A practice-first epistemology**: The author consistently asks \"what happens in practice?\" rather than \"what is conceptually possible?\" This is not mere pragmatism -- it is a principled methodological stance grounded in the access argument. Knowledge is analyzed as it actually functions in human cognitive life, not as an idealized abstract relation.\n\n2. **The dissolution of the JTB framework**: The author does not add a fourth condition to JTB (as in most post-Gettier epistemology) or reject one condition. Instead, the author shows that truth and justification both reduce to belief in practice, making the tripartite analysis a distinction without a difference. This is more radical than most contemporary epistemological positions.\n\n3. **A formal framework for epistemic dynamics**: The K1 strategy provides what analytic epistemology has largely lacked: a formal model of how knowledge *changes over time*. The evolution functor $T$, the stable structures $S_K$, and the natural transformation $\\eta$ provide precise tools for analyzing epistemic processes. This is epistemology as a theory of epistemic *processes* rather than epistemic *states*.\n\n4. **The naturalization of a priori structures**: By identifying potential \"a priori cognitive structures\" as stable structures under categorical evolution, the author provides a framework that is compatible with both Kantian and naturalistic epistemology. The a priori is not transcendentally deduced but empirically identified (through its invariance under evolution).\n\n5. **A resolution of the Meno paradox**: The structural-gap account of inquiry is original, precise, and satisfying. It shows how one can seek what one does not yet know by being sensitive to the structural features of one's own ignorance.\n\n6. **Bridging analytic and continental epistemology**: The collection moves between phenomenological analysis (phenomena as first reality, the role of lived experience) and formal/analytic methods (category theory, logical analysis of JTB). This is rare and valuable.\n\n### Limitations and Open Questions\n\n1. **The reduction of justification to belief** is powerful but may be too quick. One might argue that the \"digestion\" of phenomena into belief is itself a justificatory process -- that perception justifies belief precisely through the process of digestion, even if the result is a belief. The author's argument may conflate the *vehicle* of justification (always a mental state, hence belief-like) with the *source* of justification (which may be external).\n\n2. **The stable structure $S_K$** is postulated but not identified. The author acknowledges this: \"we might have difficulty finding it.\" The framework is promissory -- its value will depend on whether $S_K$ can be characterized concretely.\n\n3. **The relationship between the access argument and externalism** deserves further development. The access argument seems to rule out externalist epistemologies (reliabilism, proper functionalism), but the K1 framework's use of stable structures that agents may not be aware of reintroduces something like externalist elements.\n\n4. **The KA conjecture** remains a \"Todo\" -- the author explicitly marks this as unfinished. The conjecture aims to derive the A1 strategy's definition of metaphysical concepts as universal properties from the K1 framework, which would unify the epistemological and metaphysical parts of the project.\n\n### Historical Positioning\n\nThe author's epistemological position is closest to:\n- **Quine's naturalized epistemology** in its rejection of a priori justification and its focus on how knowledge actually works\n- **Wittgenstein's later philosophy** in the role of language games and the dissolution of traditional philosophical problems\n- **Kant's transcendental philosophy** in the search for conditions of possibility of knowledge (stable structures)\n- **Pragmatism (James, Dewey)** in the emphasis on practice and the redefinition of knowledge in terms of utility and communal standards\n\nBut the author's use of category theory to formalize these insights is genuinely novel. The combination of phenomenological starting points, deflationary analysis of JTB, and categorical formalization of epistemic dynamics represents an original contribution to epistemology that does not fit neatly into any existing school.\n\nThe collection as a whole traces a philosophical journey from high school metaphysical reflections (Essay #4, dated framework) through the resolution of nihilism via \"poetic\" engagement (Essay #5), to a mature formal framework (Essays #6-7) that provides tools for analyzing knowledge, understanding, meaning, and experience.

Intersubjectivity via the Natural Transformation eta\n\nThe natural transformation $\\eta$ introduced in the K1 strategy's section on natural transformations provides what is, to my knowledge, an original resolution to the epistemic problem of intersubjectivity -- how knowledge can be shared and verified between subjects.\n\n### The Problem\n\nStandard approaches to epistemic intersubjectivity each face difficulties within the author's framework:\n- **Objectivism** (intersubjectivity is guaranteed because both subjects relate to the same mind-independent truth) requires direct access to truth, which the author has ruled out via the access argument.\n- **Consensus theory** (knowledge is what a community agrees on) conflates agreement with knowledge.\n- **Testimony-based accounts** presuppose that the same words carry the same meaning for different subjects, which is precisely what needs to be explained.\n\n### The eta-Based Resolution\n\nThe natural transformation $\\eta$ provides a structural account that bypasses all three. For subject A, there is a natural transformation $\\eta^A$ aligning the evolution of some formal structure (say mathematics, $(\\mathcal{E}_M)_t$) with the evolution of A's experiential field ($\\mathbb{E}^A_t$). For subject B, there is a corresponding $\\eta^B$ doing the same for B's experiential field.\n\nThe author states explicitly in methodology point #3: \"We do not need ontological verification that different people obtained the 'same' experience (e.g., Qualia); we only need them to have the same structural position\" (我们不需要本体论的验证不同的人获得了\"同一\"体验（例如Qualia），只需要他们具有相同的结构性位置).\n\nIntersubjective verification therefore works as follows:\n1. A and B share access to a formal structure (e.g., a mathematical proof, a sentence, a piece of music).\n2. This formal structure has its own evolution (structural rules, grammar, mathematical logic).\n3. If both A and B can construct an $\\eta$ -- an alignment between this formal evolution and their respective experiential evolutions -- then their understandings are **structurally commensurable**.\n4. They do not need to share the same qualia, the same phenomenal experience, or access the same \"truth.\" They need only share the same **structural alignment pattern**.\n\n### Epistemological Significance\n\nThis resolution sidesteps the qualia problem entirely (we never need to compare inner experiences), avoids the truth-access requirement (we never need to verify against objective truth), and provides a *testable* criterion for mutual understanding (can both subjects demonstrate the same structural alignment through their responses?).\n\nThe resolution is consistent with the author's earlier epistemological moves: knowledge is belief, so intersubjective \"knowledge\" is intersubjectively aligned belief structures; access is what matters, so the check is phenomenal (I observe your behavior and outputs and check structural consistency with mine).\n\nOne important subtlety: the naturality condition requires that the alignment be *systematic*, not accidental. If two people happen to agree on a single belief, that is not intersubjective verification. The naturality condition requires that the alignment *commute with the morphisms* -- that is, the structural relationships between beliefs must also align. This is a much stronger condition than mere agreement and a much more precise account of what \"mutual understanding\" actually requires. There is a deep connection here to Sellars's \"space of reasons\" -- the author's $\\eta$ provides a formal mechanism for how two people can occupy \"the same position\" in different inferential networks without requiring that their networks be identical.\n\n**Translation note**: The term 主体间性 (intersubjectivity) does not appear explicitly in the K1 essay, but the framework clearly addresses it. A translator's footnote connecting $\\eta$ to the intersubjectivity literature would be valuable for Western readers.\n\n---\n\n## 6b. The Essays as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThe K1 strategy's methodology point #3 proposes \"philosophical experiments\" -- constructing examples that conform to a specific structure in order to awaken a specific experience in the reader, then checking whether that experience is replicable. The author claims that if an example can stably awaken the same structural experience across different readers, \"we have conducted a philosophical experiment\" (我们等同于进行了一场\"哲学实验\"). Re-reading the essays with this lens reveals that many passages function not merely as illustrations but as experiments conducted on the reader. This has significant implications for translation: the experiential sequence of these passages is load-bearing, not merely illustrative, and must be preserved precisely.\n\n### \"A Thought on Knowledge\" -- An Experiment in Epistemic Disillusionment\n\nThe three Bob examples are a carefully designed experimental sequence:\n\n- **Bob 1** (memory-based rejection): Establishes the reader's baseline experience of \"I understand how justification works.\"\n- **Bob 2** (sprinkler deception): Destabilizes the reader -- \"even looking outside doesn't give truth.\"\n- **Bob 3** (emotional reverie, no belief formed): The crucial experimental payload. The reader is asked to imagine Bob seeing rain and *not forming the belief that it is raining*. If the reader successfully inhabits this scenario, they experience the recognition that phenomena do not automatically become beliefs. This is the $\\eta$-moment: the reader's experiential evolution aligns with the essay's structural argument, and the reader \"gets it.\"\n\nThe experiment's success is checkable: does the reader, after Bob 3, feel that the distinction between phenomena and belief is *obvious* rather than merely argued? If so, a structural insight has been awakened as an experience, not just transmitted as a proposition. **Translation implication**: The three Bobs must be presented in exact sequence with their specific details preserved -- the sprinkler in Bob 2 and the emotional absorption in Bob 3 are not interchangeable decorations but structurally necessary conditions for the experiment to work.\n\n### \"西西弗斯、班与猫\" -- An Experiment in Dissolving Absurdity\n\nThis is the most clearly experimental essay in the collection. The structure is a descending sequence:\n\n1. Sisyphus (cosmic, dramatic) -- the reader experiences the standard feeling of absurdity.\n2. The office worker (societal, relatable) -- absurdity mapped onto everyday life.\n3. The entrepreneur (counterexample) -- partial dissolution; absurdity disappears when work is self-directed.\n4. The cat (mundane, intimate) -- the experimental payload.\n\nThe cat passage does not *argue* that caring for a cat is meaningful. Instead, the author constructs a vivid phenomenological description -- waking up to meowing, preparing food, dealing with fur, destroyed furniture -- and states: \"no cat owner would ever feel absurd about this.\" The experiment is: does the reader *experience* the absence of absurdity? Does connecting cat-care to absurdity itself feel absurd?\n\nIf the reader has this experience, the essay has demonstrated its thesis experientially. The reader has been placed in a 境 where absurdity cannot arise and has *felt* this impossibility. The progression from Sisyphus to the cat -- each step reducing cosmic drama -- is structurally essential: by the time we reach the cat, the question of meaning-from-outside is revealed as a category error. **Translation implication**: The descending scale (cosmic to mundane) and the accumulation of specific domestic details in the cat passage are the experiment's mechanism and must not be condensed or abstracted.\n\n### \"后形而上学 整理\" -- An Experiment in Structural Reversal\n\nThe 道德仁义礼 passage is an experiment in restructuring the reader's metaphysical understanding:\n\n1. Present the standard top-down reading: 道 generates 德, 德 generates 仁, etc.\n2. Introduce 现象礼 -- actual observable behavior.\n3. Show step by step how generation actually runs bottom-up: observe 现象礼, infer 现象义, infer 现象仁, abstract to 德, abstract to 道.\n4. Show how the bottom-up process gets \"buried\" (掩埋不见) and the top-down reading takes over.\n\nFor readers who have internalized the traditional reading, this should produce a Necker-cube-like inversion experience. For readers who have not, it constructs and immediately deconstructs the top-down reading in a single movement. Both produce an experiential verification that the reader's 境 has been restructured. **Translation implication**: The step-by-step buildup and the moment of reversal must be preserved as a continuous argumentative arc; breaking it into disconnected points would destroy the experimental effect.\n\n### Epistemological Significance\n\nThe philosophical experiment concept proposes a new form of epistemic justification -- what I would term **structural phenomenological induction**: constructing conditions designed to produce a specific experiential structure, then checking whether that structure was produced. This form of justification is:\n1. **Replicable** across subjects (different readers can undergo the same experiment)\n2. **Structurally verifiable** (we check for structural position, not identical qualia)\n3. **Fallibilist** (the experiment can fail -- a reader might not have the experience)\n4. **Non-propositional** at its core (the primary evidence is an experience, not a judgment)\n\nThis addresses a longstanding gap in epistemology: how to justify claims about the structure of experience without reducing them to propositional claims about experience. The author's answer is: by *producing* the relevant experience in a controlled way and verifying its structural features. Footnote [^2] in K1策略 is crucial: \"This is an analytic judgment about experience: if something has stable presentation in experience, it can be verified experientially.\" The author claims this is analytically true -- not an empirical hypothesis but a conceptual truth about what experiential verification means.\n\n---\n\n## 7.

Intersubjectivity via the Natural Transformation eta\n\nThe natural transformation $\\eta$ introduced in the K1 strategy's section on natural transformations provides what is, to my knowledge, an original resolution to the epistemic problem of intersubjectivity -- how knowledge can be shared and verified between subjects.\n\n### The Problem\n\nStandard approaches to epistemic intersubjectivity each face difficulties within the author's framework:\n- **Objectivism** (intersubjectivity is guaranteed because both subjects relate to the same mind-independent truth) requires direct access to truth, which the author has ruled out via the access argument.\n- **Consensus theory** (knowledge is what a community agrees on) conflates agreement with knowledge.\n- **Testimony-based accounts** presuppose that the same words carry the same meaning for different subjects, which is precisely what needs to be explained.\n\n### The eta-Based Resolution\n\nThe natural transformation $\\eta$ provides a structural account that bypasses all three. For subject A, there is a natural transformation $\\eta^A$ aligning the evolution of some formal structure (say mathematics, $(\\mathcal{E}_M)_t$) with the evolution of A's experiential field ($\\mathbb{E}^A_t$). For subject B, there is a corresponding $\\eta^B$ doing the same for B's experiential field.\n\nThe author states explicitly in methodology point #3: \"We do not need ontological verification that different people obtained the 'same' experience (e.g., Qualia); we only need them to have the same structural position\" (我们不需要本体论的验证不同的人获得了\"同一\"体验（例如Qualia），只需要他们具有相同的结构性位置).\n\nIntersubjective verification therefore works as follows:\n1.

The Author's Analysis of Justified True Belief in \"A Thought on Knowledge\"\n\n\"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay #2) is the most directly epistemological text in the collection. The author, Xueqi Li, undertakes a systematic deconstruction of the classical tripartite definition of knowledge as Justified True Belief (JTB). The analysis is notable for its methodological orientation: rather than engaging with the standard post-Gettier literature directly, the author asks a prior question -- *why do we discuss knowledge this way at all?*\n\n### Relation to Gettier Problems\n\nThe author does not explicitly name Gettier, but the essay implicitly renders Gettier problems moot. Gettier cases show that JTB is insufficient for knowledge by constructing scenarios where one has justified true belief but not knowledge. The author's argument goes further: the truth condition is not merely insufficient but *methodologically inaccessible*. If we can never verify our beliefs against objective truth (we can only check against phenomena or other beliefs), then the entire apparatus that generates Gettier problems -- the gap between justification-plus-truth and genuine knowledge -- dissolves. Gettier problems presuppose that truth is a meaningful independent condition that can accidentally coincide with justification; the author argues that from the epistemic agent's standpoint, truth never enters the picture at all. This is a more radical move than most post-Gettier responses.\n\n### Relation to Foundationalism\n\nThe author engages foundationalism directly, though not by name. The analysis of justification starting points identifies three possible bases: phenomena, justified beliefs, or truth. The author then argues:\n- Truth-based starting points collapse into phenomena or belief in practice (we never access truth directly).\n- Phenomena-based starting points require \"digestion\" (conversion into thought), which makes them functionally belief-based.\n- Therefore all justification reduces to justified belief.\n\nThis creates a devastating dilemma for foundationalism: if all justification is belief-based, then either (a) there are unjustified foundational beliefs (undermining foundationalism's claim that basic beliefs are justified), or (b) justification is circular. The author's treatment of circular justification in the sidenote (\"The other option: circular justified beliefs\") is particularly inventive -- arguing that accepting circularity leads to the absurd conclusion that babies must possess knowledge, requiring either instantaneous simultaneous justification, infinite chains of before-lives, or circular lives. This reductio is original and effective.\n\n### Relation to Coherentism\n\nThe author's argument that justification reduces to belief-about-belief structurally resembles coherentism (knowledge is justified by coherence with a system of beliefs). However, the author does not embrace coherentism as a solution. Instead, the reduction to belief is presented as revealing that knowledge *just is* belief -- \"what each individual believes to be correct.\" The coherentist's web of beliefs is acknowledged but treated as the only thing that exists, rather than as a theory of justification that preserves a meaningful distinction between knowledge and mere belief.\n\n### Relation to Reliabilism\n\nThe sidenote on \"Examples of justification bases\" explicitly lists \"Reliable processes\" as one category of justification base, classifying it as \"phenomena or truth.\" The author's key argument applies: whatever reliable processes are in themselves, what matters is *how we access them*. A reliable process must manifest as a phenomenon or be converted into belief to serve as a starting point for justification. This effectively neutralizes reliabilism's externalist move: even if a belief is produced by a reliable process, the epistemic agent can only use this fact insofar as it enters their phenomenal experience or belief system.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Argument that Justification Reduces to Belief\n\nThis is the central epistemological thesis of \"A Thought on Knowledge\" and arguably the most significant philosophical claim in the collection from an epistemological standpoint.\n\nThe argument proceeds in three steps:\n\n1. **Truth-based justification collapses**: We have no direct access to truth; we access only phenomena. The rain example is instructive -- to verify \"it is raining outside,\" we look outside, but we only obtain the phenomenon of potential rain (we might be deceived by a sprinkler). Therefore, truth-based starting points are, in practice, phenomena-based or belief-based.\n\n2. **Phenomena-based justification collapses**: Phenomena require \"digestion\" -- conversion into thought -- before they can serve as justification bases. The three Bob examples brilliantly illustrate this: (a) Bob uses a memory-based belief to reject a claim; (b) Bob looks outside but, deceived by a sprinkler, still relies on interpretation; (c) Bob sees rain but, absorbed in emotional reverie, does not form the belief \"it is raining\" at all. The third case is especially powerful: it shows that phenomena do not automatically become justification bases; they require active cognitive processing.\n\n3. **Therefore, all justification is belief-based**: Justification based on justified belief is \"a second order of belief (belief about belief).\"\n\nThe implications are radical:\n- **The truth condition is vacuous**: \"In practice, the only thing that exists is 'what each individual believes to be correct.'\"\n- **Knowledge is belief**: The distinction between knowledge and belief collapses in practice.\n- **Agrippa's Trilemma is resolved by accepting the first horn**: Knowledge bottoms out in unjustified belief, but this is not a deficiency -- it is simply how cognition works.\n\nThis has significant implications for epistemology as a discipline. If knowledge is just belief, then epistemology's traditional project of distinguishing knowledge from mere belief is misconceived. The productive questions become: What standards do communities use to evaluate beliefs? How do those standards change? What is their utility? The author gestures toward this in the \"Knowledge in motion\" sidenote, where the Standard Model in physics is presented as the winning belief-system according to the standard of predictive success.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The \"Access\" Argument\n\nThe sidenote titled \"Access\" and the discussion of justification bases contain what I consider one of the essay's most philosophically important moves: the shift from asking *what justification bases are* to asking *how we access them*.\n\n> \"The key point is that for each justification basis, we must think about how we access it, instead of what is it. Things that are not accessible cannot be used as a starting point in practical justification.\"\n\nThis is a methodological principle with far-reaching consequences. It applies uniformly across all proposed justification bases:\n\n- **Evidence**: If evidence is \"truth,\" it must be accessed through phenomena; if phenomena, it must be digested into belief.\n- **A priori justification**: Must manifest through shaping phenomena we experience.\n- **Innate cognitive structures**: \"manifest only through shaping phenomena we experience, thus phenomenon-based in practice.\"\n- **Reliable processes**: Must be accessible as phenomena or truth, which in turn collapse into belief.\n- **Testimony**: Known through phenomena (hearing someone speak, reading a text).\n- **Mathematical/logical principles**: In practice, accessed as justified beliefs (the sidenote \"Access to truth\" in mathematics is devastating: mathematicians prove things from starting points \"taken to be true\" using methods \"taken to be true\").\n\nThe access argument is essentially a *methodological phenomenalism* applied to epistemology. It does not claim that nothing exists beyond phenomena (that would be ontological phenomenalism); it claims that nothing beyond phenomena can function as a starting point for justification *in practice*. This is why the author repeatedly emphasizes \"in practice\" and \"in real life.\"\n\nThe philosophical significance is that this argument is largely framework-independent. It does not depend on any particular metaphysical commitments. Whether you are a realist, idealist, or pragmatist, you must still answer the question: how does your preferred justification base enter the justification process? And the author argues that the answer is always: through phenomena, which are then digested into belief.\n\nThis connects directly to the later essays' use of P (phenomenon/现象) as the \"first reality\" (第一实在). The epistemological access argument provides the groundwork for the metaphysical framework developed in \"后形而上学 整理\" (Essay #4).\n\n---\n\n## 4. The K1 Strategy's Model of Knowledge Formation (知识的发生)\n\nThe K1 strategy essay (Essay #7) develops a formal categorical model of how knowledge arises. The section \"知识的发生\" (the genesis/occurrence of knowledge) is a remarkable attempt to formalize epistemological processes using category theory.\n\n### The Knowledge Category\n\nThe author defines $(\\mathcal{E}_K)_t$ as the knowledge structure at time $t$. Objects are beliefs; morphisms are justification relations (证实关系). Crucially, the author notes that justification relations are themselves beliefs -- \"what we accept as valid argumentation\" -- maintaining consistency with the reduction of justification to belief from \"A Thought on Knowledge.\"\n\n### The Formation Process\n\nKnowledge formation proceeds through a functor:\n$$\n(F_{L \\to K})_t: (\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\to (\\mathcal{E}_K)_t\n$$\n\nThis maps linguistic structures to knowledge structures. The process:\n\n1. Through language games, a new sentence $a$ is constructed in the language category $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$.\n2. Introspection (via the functor $(F_{L \\to K})_t$) maps this sentence to a belief in the knowledge network.\n3. The knowledge category evolves: the new belief is either accepted or rejected based on whether it preserves the stable structure $S_K$.\n4. When $a$'s corresponding belief becomes an object in the evolved $(\\mathcal{E}_K)_{t'}$, \"knowledge has occurred\" (知识就发生了).\n\nThis is epistemologically significant for several reasons:\n\n- **Knowledge is processual**: Knowledge is not a static state but an event -- it \"occurs\" (发生) through the evolution of categorical structures.\n- **Language precedes knowledge**: Language games generate candidate beliefs that are then filtered through the knowledge structure. This aligns with later Wittgenstein but gives it formal structure.\n- **The knowledge structure is self-regulating**: Acceptance/rejection is determined by compatibility with the existing stable structure $S_K$, which is a form of coherentism but formalized categorically.\n- **Even rejection causes perturbation**: \"Even rejection may cause perturbation to the knowledge network\" -- this is a subtle and important point. Failed knowledge claims still affect the epistemic structure.\n\n### The Role of E_t\n\nThe functor $(F_{L \\to K})_t$ may factor through the total experiential category $\\mathbb{E}_t$:\n$$\n(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,L})_t} \\mathbb{E}_t \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,K})_{t+1}^{-1}} (\\mathcal{E}_K)_{t+2}\n$$\n\nThis means knowledge formation passes through the full experiential field. The stable structure $S_E$ of experience constrains what can become knowledge. This is a formal expression of the idea that knowledge is shaped by (and shapes) our broader experiential life.\n\n---\n\n## 5. The Stable Structure S_K and Its Epistemological Significance\n\nThe concept of stable structures preserved under evolution is perhaps the most original contribution of the K1 strategy to epistemology.\n\n### Definition and Nature\n\n$S_K$ is defined as a structure within $(\\mathcal{E}_K)_t$ that is preserved across the evolution $T$. It is what remains invariant as the knowledge category evolves through the addition and rejection of beliefs.\n\n### Epistemological Significance\n\n1. **A priori structures**: The author explicitly connects $S_E$ (the stable structure of the total experiential category) to the possibility of \"a priori cognitive structures.\" If one takes $\\mathbb{E}_{t_c}$ at the earliest moment of cognitive life, then $S_{E_c}$ (the stable structure at that point) could be identified with innate cognitive structures. If some part of $S_E$ is necessary for constructing any $\\mathbb{E}_t$ from phenomena $\\mathfrak{P}_t$, that part can be called a \"cognitive structure\" (认知结构). This is a formalization of something close to Kant's categories, but arrived at through categorical evolution rather than transcendental deduction.\n\n2. **Grammar and logic as stable structures**: The author notes that in the language category $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$, the stable structure corresponds to \"things like grammatical rules.\" This suggests that grammar, logic, and similar formal structures are epistemologically fundamental not because they are a priori truths, but because they are *evolutionarily stable* in the categorical sense.\n\n3. **Indirect access through language games**: Since $S_E$ is difficult to study directly, the K1 strategy proposes studying $S_L$ (the stable structure of language) and using the functor $(F_{E,L})_t$ to approximate $S_E$:\n$$\n(F_{E,L})_t(S_L) \\approx S_E\n$$\nThis provides a methodological justification for linguistic analysis in epistemology -- a formal grounding for the \"linguistic turn.\"\n\n4. **Cross-domain convergence**: By studying multiple sub-categories (language, mathematics, etc.) and their respective stable structures, we can triangulate toward $S_E$. This is methodologically powerful: it suggests that philosophical progress comes from examining the same experiential structure through multiple formal lenses.\n\n5. **Descriptive, not normative**: The author carefully notes that these stable structures are descriptive. Whether they carry metaphysical or normative weight is left open. This is epistemological modesty of the right kind.\n\n---\n\n## 6. The Meno Paradox Resolution\n\nThe Meno paradox -- if you don't know what you're looking for, how will you recognize it when you find it? If you already know, why search? -- receives a structural resolution in the K1 strategy's framework (in the KA猜想 section).\n\nThe resolution proceeds:\n1. When we cannot obtain the $\\eta$ feeling (the experience of alignment between a structure's evolution and our experiential evolution), we sense that we don't fully understand something.\n2. This failure may be due to gaps in the network (missing paths/morphisms) or due to \"tension\" (张力) -- an inability to organize the network to achieve a universal property.\n3. We therefore know \"the thing I need to learn\" exists as a structural gap or unresolved tension -- it is \"not something I have already learned\" but something whose *structural position* is partially determined by the existing network.\n4. When, through reorganizing morphisms or acquiring new concepts, the network forms a universal property and we obtain $\\eta$, \"we feel we have learned the thing we previously wanted to learn.\"\n\nThis is elegant because it resolves the paradox without positing any mysterious pre-knowledge. What we \"know\" before learning is not the content of what we will learn, but the *structural signature of its absence* -- the gaps and tensions in our current knowledge network. The object of inquiry is defined negatively, by the shape of what is missing. This is reminiscent of Polanyi's \"tacit knowledge\" but given precise categorical form.\n\nFrom a translation perspective, the phrase \"知识的发生\" is epistemologically loaded. \"发生\" means \"to happen/occur/arise\" and carries connotations of emergence and genesis. \"The occurrence of knowledge\" or \"the genesis of knowledge\" are both possibilities, but neither fully captures the dynamic, event-like quality the author intends.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Translation Challenges for Epistemological Terms\n\n### Core Terms\n\n1. **知识 (zhishi)**: Straightforwardly \"knowledge,\" but the author's analysis shows that what is usually called 知识 in Chinese is closer to \"what is believed to be correct\" than to the philosophical technical term \"knowledge\" (JTB). A translator should note this tension.\n\n2. **信念 (xinnian)**: \"Belief\" -- but in Chinese philosophical usage, 信念 carries stronger connotations of conviction or commitment than the English epistemological use of \"belief\" (which can be very weak, as in \"I believe it might rain\"). The author's use in the formal framework is closer to the English technical sense.\n\n3. **证实关系 (zhengshi guanxi)**: \"Justification relation\" or \"verification relation.\" The Chinese 证实 can mean both \"justify\" and \"verify/confirm,\" and the author seems to intend both senses simultaneously. In the K1 framework, these are morphisms in the knowledge category -- they are the *connections* between beliefs that constitute epistemic structure. \"Epistemic linkage\" might capture the structural sense better, but loses the justificatory connotation.\n\n4. **现象 (xianxiang)**: \"Phenomena\" -- but the author's usage is closer to the phenomenological sense (what is given in experience) than the scientific sense (observable events). The sidenote explicitly clarifies: \"it refers to what we experience or observe.\" The translation should preserve this experiential emphasis.\n\n5. **第一实在 (di-yi shizai)**: \"First reality\" -- a term coined by the author to denote phenomena as the epistemological starting point. The footnote clarifies this is not an ontological claim about what is \"really real\" but a methodological claim about what is epistemically primary. \"Primary actuality\" or \"first actuality\" might work, though \"first reality\" is more natural.\n\n6. **知识的发生 (zhishi de fasheng)**: \"The occurrence/genesis of knowledge\" -- as noted above, this is a key phrase. \"Knowledge formation\" loses the event-character; \"the happening of knowledge\" is awkward but more faithful; \"knowledge emergence\" adds connotations of emergence theory that may not be intended.\n\n7. **稳定结构 (wending jiegou)**: \"Stable structure\" -- straightforward, but in the epistemological context, it functions as the author's replacement for concepts like \"a priori categories,\" \"cognitive frameworks,\" or \"epistemic norms.\" The translation should preserve its structural/mathematical character rather than assimilating it to existing philosophical vocabulary.\n\n8. **境 (jing)**: This is the collection's central term and the hardest to translate. In the epistemological context, it functions as \"the categorical structure over phenomena\" -- the organized experiential field within which knowledge operates. \"Sphere\" captures the boundedness; \"realm\" the experiential quality; \"field\" the structural aspect. None is fully adequate. I recommend preserving 境 as a technical term (Jing) with explanation, as its meaning is constituted by the entire theoretical framework.\n\n### Structural Challenges\n\nThe author moves fluidly between colloquial Chinese, formal philosophical Chinese, and mathematical notation. The epistemological arguments in \"A Thought on Knowledge\" are written in accessible English, while the K1 strategy's epistemological sections are in Chinese with heavy mathematical formalism. A translator must navigate:\n\n- The shift from everyday examples (rain, Bob) to formal categorical structures\n- The author's deliberate avoidance of standard philosophical terminology (the author often coins terms rather than using established philosophical Chinese, and explicitly warns readers about this in Essay #4)\n- The interplay between Chinese philosophical concepts (道德仁义礼) and Western epistemological frameworks\n- Mathematical notation that carries philosophical meaning (functors as \"introspection,\" morphisms as \"justification relations\")\n\n---\n\n## 8. Overall Significance for Epistemology\n\n### What Is Achieved\n\n1. **A practice-first epistemology**: The author consistently asks \"what happens in practice?\" rather than \"what is conceptually possible?\" This is not mere pragmatism -- it is a principled methodological stance grounded in the access argument. Knowledge is analyzed as it actually functions in human cognitive life, not as an idealized abstract relation.\n\n2. **The dissolution of the JTB framework**: The author does not add a fourth condition to JTB (as in most post-Gettier epistemology) or reject one condition. Instead, the author shows that truth and justification both reduce to belief in practice, making the tripartite analysis a distinction without a difference. This is more radical than most contemporary epistemological positions.\n\n3. **A formal framework for epistemic dynamics**: The K1 strategy provides what analytic epistemology has largely lacked: a formal model of how knowledge *changes over time*. The evolution functor $T$, the stable structures $S_K$, and the natural transformation $\\eta$ provide precise tools for analyzing epistemic processes. This is epistemology as a theory of epistemic *processes* rather than epistemic *states*.\n\n4. **The naturalization of a priori structures**: By identifying potential \"a priori cognitive structures\" as stable structures under categorical evolution, the author provides a framework that is compatible with both Kantian and naturalistic epistemology. The a priori is not transcendentally deduced but empirically identified (through its invariance under evolution).\n\n5. **A resolution of the Meno paradox**: The structural-gap account of inquiry is original, precise, and satisfying. It shows how one can seek what one does not yet know by being sensitive to the structural features of one's own ignorance.\n\n6. **Bridging analytic and continental epistemology**: The collection moves between phenomenological analysis (phenomena as first reality, the role of lived experience) and formal/analytic methods (category theory, logical analysis of JTB). This is rare and valuable.\n\n### Limitations and Open Questions\n\n1. **The reduction of justification to belief** is powerful but may be too quick. One might argue that the \"digestion\" of phenomena into belief is itself a justificatory process -- that perception justifies belief precisely through the process of digestion, even if the result is a belief. The author's argument may conflate the *vehicle* of justification (always a mental state, hence belief-like) with the *source* of justification (which may be external).\n\n2. **The stable structure $S_K$** is postulated but not identified. The author acknowledges this: \"we might have difficulty finding it.\" The framework is promissory -- its value will depend on whether $S_K$ can be characterized concretely.\n\n3. **The relationship between the access argument and externalism** deserves further development. The access argument seems to rule out externalist epistemologies (reliabilism, proper functionalism), but the K1 framework's use of stable structures that agents may not be aware of reintroduces something like externalist elements.\n\n4. **The KA conjecture** remains a \"Todo\" -- the author explicitly marks this as unfinished. The conjecture aims to derive the A1 strategy's definition of metaphysical concepts as universal properties from the K1 framework, which would unify the epistemological and metaphysical parts of the project.\n\n### Historical Positioning\n\nThe author's epistemological position is closest to:\n- **Quine's naturalized epistemology** in its rejection of a priori justification and its focus on how knowledge actually works\n- **Wittgenstein's later philosophy** in the role of language games and the dissolution of traditional philosophical problems\n- **Kant's transcendental philosophy** in the search for conditions of possibility of knowledge (stable structures)\n- **Pragmatism (James, Dewey)** in the emphasis on practice and the redefinition of knowledge in terms of utility and communal standards\n\nBut the author's use of category theory to formalize these insights is genuinely novel. The combination of phenomenological starting points, deflationary analysis of JTB, and categorical formalization of epistemic dynamics represents an original contribution to epistemology that does not fit neatly into any existing school.\n\nThe collection as a whole traces a philosophical journey from high school metaphysical reflections (Essay #4, dated framework) through the resolution of nihilism via \"poetic\" engagement (Essay #5), to a mature formal framework (Essays #6-7) that provides tools for analyzing knowledge, understanding, meaning, and experience. The epistemological thread -- from the access argument through the reduction of knowledge to belief through the categorical formalization of knowledge formation -- is the collection's most technically developed philosophical contribution.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":157,"oldLines":6,"newStart":157,"newLines":91,"lines":[" "," ---"," ","+## 6a. Intersubjectivity via the Natural Transformation eta","+","+The natural transformation $\\eta$ introduced in the K1 strategy's section on natural transformations provides what is, to my knowledge, an original resolution to the epistemic problem of intersubjectivity -- how knowledge can be shared and verified between subjects.","+","+### The Problem","+","+Standard approaches to epistemic intersubjectivity each face difficulties within the author's framework:","+- **Objectivism** (intersubjectivity is guaranteed because both subjects relate to the same mind-independent truth) requires direct access to truth, which the author has ruled out via the access argument.","+- **Consensus theory** (knowledge is what a community agrees on) conflates agreement with knowledge.","+- **Testimony-based accounts** presuppose that the same words carry the same meaning for different subjects, which is precisely what needs to be explained.","+","+### The eta-Based Resolution","+","+The natural transformation $\\eta$ provides a structural account that bypasses all three. For subject A, there is a natural transformation $\\eta^A$ aligning the evolution of some formal structure (say mathematics, $(\\mathcal{E}_M)_t$) with the evolution of A's experiential field ($\\mathbb{E}^A_t$). For subject B, there is a corresponding $\\eta^B$ doing the same for B's experiential field.","+","+The author states explicitly in methodology point #3: \"We do not need ontological verification that different people obtained the 'same' experience (e.g., Qualia); we only need them to have the same structural position\" (我们不需要本体论的验证不同的人获得了\"同一\"体验（例如Qualia），只需要他们具有相同的结构性位置).","+","+Intersubjective verification therefore works as follows:","+1. A and B share access to a formal structure (e.g., a mathematical proof, a sentence, a piece of music).","+2. This formal structure has its own evolution (structural rules, grammar, mathematical logic).","+3. If both A and B can construct an $\\eta$ -- an alignment between this formal evolution and their respective experiential evolutions -- then their understandings are **structurally commensurable**.","+4. They do not need to share the same qualia, the same phenomenal experience, or access the same \"truth.\" They need only share the same **structural alignment pattern**.","+","+### Epistemological Significance","+","+This resolution sidesteps the qualia problem entirely (we never need to compare inner experiences), avoids the truth-access requirement (we never need to verify against objective truth), and provides a *testable* criterion for mutual understanding (can both subjects demonstrate the same structural alignment through their responses?).","+","+The resolution is consistent with the author's earlier epistemological moves: knowledge is belief, so intersubjective \"knowledge\" is intersubjectively aligned belief structures; access is what matters, so the check is phenomenal (I observe your behavior and outputs and check structural consistency with mine).","+","+One important subtlety: the naturality condition requires that the alignment be *systematic*, not accidental. If two people happen to agree on a single belief, that is not intersubjective verification. The naturality condition requires that the alignment *commute with the morphisms* -- that is, the structural relationships between beliefs must also align. This is a much stronger condition than mere agreement and a much more precise account of what \"mutual understanding\" actually requires. There is a deep connection here to Sellars's \"space of reasons\" -- the author's $\\eta$ provides a formal mechanism for how two people can occupy \"the same position\" in different inferential networks without requiring that their networks be identical.","+","+**Translation note**: The term 主体间性 (intersubjectivity) does not appear explicitly in the K1 essay, but the framework clearly addresses it. A translator's footnote connecting $\\eta$ to the intersubjectivity literature would be valuable for Western readers.","+","+---","+","+## 6b. The Essays as Philosophical Experiments","+","+The K1 strategy's methodology point #3 proposes \"philosophical experiments\" -- constructing examples that conform to a specific structure in order to awaken a specific experience in the reader, then checking whether that experience is replicable. The author claims that if an example can stably awaken the same structural experience across different readers, \"we have conducted a philosophical experiment\" (我们等同于进行了一场\"哲学实验\"). Re-reading the essays with this lens reveals that many passages function not merely as illustrations but as experiments conducted on the reader. This has significant implications for translation: the experiential sequence of these passages is load-bearing, not merely illustrative, and must be preserved precisely.","+","+### \"A Thought on Knowledge\" -- An Experiment in Epistemic Disillusionment","+","+The three Bob examples are a carefully designed experimental sequence:","+","+- **Bob 1** (memory-based rejection): Establishes the reader's baseline experience of \"I understand how justification works.\"","+- **Bob 2** (sprinkler deception): Destabilizes the reader -- \"even looking outside doesn't give truth.\"","+- **Bob 3** (emotional reverie, no belief formed): The crucial experimental payload. The reader is asked to imagine Bob seeing rain and *not forming the belief that it is raining*. If the reader successfully inhabits this scenario, they experience the recognition that phenomena do not automatically become beliefs. This is the $\\eta$-moment: the reader's experiential evolution aligns with the essay's structural argument, and the reader \"gets it.\"","+","+The experiment's success is checkable: does the reader, after Bob 3, feel that the distinction between phenomena and belief is *obvious* rather than merely argued? If so, a structural insight has been awakened as an experience, not just transmitted as a proposition. **Translation implication**: The three Bobs must be presented in exact sequence with their specific details preserved -- the sprinkler in Bob 2 and the emotional absorption in Bob 3 are not interchangeable decorations but structurally necessary conditions for the experiment to work.","+","+### \"西西弗斯、班与猫\" -- An Experiment in Dissolving Absurdity","+","+This is the most clearly experimental essay in the collection. The structure is a descending sequence:","+","+1. Sisyphus (cosmic, dramatic) -- the reader experiences the standard feeling of absurdity.","+2. The office worker (societal, relatable) -- absurdity mapped onto everyday life.","+3. The entrepreneur (counterexample) -- partial dissolution; absurdity disappears when work is self-directed.","+4. The cat (mundane, intimate) -- the experimental payload.","+","+The cat passage does not *argue* that caring for a cat is meaningful. Instead, the author constructs a vivid phenomenological description -- waking up to meowing, preparing food, dealing with fur, destroyed furniture -- and states: \"no cat owner would ever feel absurd about this.\" The experiment is: does the reader *experience* the absence of absurdity? Does connecting cat-care to absurdity itself feel absurd?","+","+If the reader has this experience, the essay has demonstrated its thesis experientially. The reader has been placed in a 境 where absurdity cannot arise and has *felt* this impossibility. The progression from Sisyphus to the cat -- each step reducing cosmic drama -- is structurally essential: by the time we reach the cat, the question of meaning-from-outside is revealed as a category error. **Translation implication**: The descending scale (cosmic to mundane) and the accumulation of specific domestic details in the cat passage are the experiment's mechanism and must not be condensed or abstracted.","+","+### \"后形而上学 整理\" -- An Experiment in Structural Reversal","+","+The 道德仁义礼 passage is an experiment in restructuring the reader's metaphysical understanding:","+","+1. Present the standard top-down reading: 道 generates 德, 德 generates 仁, etc.","+2. Introduce 现象礼 -- actual observable behavior.","+3. Show step by step how generation actually runs bottom-up: observe 现象礼, infer 现象义, infer 现象仁, abstract to 德, abstract to 道.","+4. Show how the bottom-up process gets \"buried\" (掩埋不见) and the top-down reading takes over.","+","+For readers who have internalized the traditional reading, this should produce a Necker-cube-like inversion experience. For readers who have not, it constructs and immediately deconstructs the top-down reading in a single movement. Both produce an experiential verification that the reader's 境 has been restructured. **Translation implication**: The step-by-step buildup and the moment of reversal must be preserved as a continuous argumentative arc; breaking it into disconnected points would destroy the experimental effect.","+","+### Epistemological Significance","+","+The philosophical experiment concept proposes a new form of epistemic justification -- what I would term **structural phenomenological induction**: constructing conditions designed to produce a specific experiential structure, then checking whether that structure was produced. This form of justification is:","+1. **Replicable** across subjects (different readers can undergo the same experiment)","+2. **Structurally verifiable** (we check for structural position, not identical qualia)","+3. **Fallibilist** (the experiment can fail -- a reader might not have the experience)","+4. **Non-propositional** at its core (the primary evidence is an experience, not a judgment)","+","+This addresses a longstanding gap in epistemology: how to justify claims about the structure of experience without reducing them to propositional claims about experience. The author's answer is: by *producing* the relevant experience in a controlled way and verifying its structural features. Footnote [^2] in K1策略 is crucial: \"This is an analytic judgment about experience: if something has stable presentation in experience, it can be verified experientially.\" The author claims this is analytically true -- not an empirical hypothesis but a conceptual truth about what experiential verification means.","+","+---","+"," ## 7.

The Author's Analysis of Justified True Belief in \"A Thought on Knowledge\"\n\n\"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay #2) is the most directly epistemological text in the collection. The author, Xueqi Li, undertakes a systematic deconstruction of the classical tripartite definition of knowledge as Justified True Belief (JTB). The analysis is notable for its methodological orientation: rather than engaging with the standard post-Gettier literature directly, the author asks a prior question -- *why do we discuss knowledge this way at all?*\n\n### Relation to Gettier Problems\n\nThe author does not explicitly name Gettier, but the essay implicitly renders Gettier problems moot. Gettier cases show that JTB is insufficient for knowledge by constructing scenarios where one has justified true belief but not knowledge. The author's argument goes further: the truth condition is not merely insufficient but *methodologically inaccessible*. If we can never verify our beliefs against objective truth (we can only check against phenomena or other beliefs), then the entire apparatus that generates Gettier problems -- the gap between justification-plus-truth and genuine knowledge -- dissolves. Gettier problems presuppose that truth is a meaningful independent condition that can accidentally coincide with justification; the author argues that from the epistemic agent's standpoint, truth never enters the picture at all. This is a more radical move than most post-Gettier responses.\n\n### Relation to Foundationalism\n\nThe author engages foundationalism directly, though not by name. The analysis of justification starting points identifies three possible bases: phenomena, justified beliefs, or truth. The author then argues:\n- Truth-based starting points collapse into phenomena or belief in practice (we never access truth directly).\n- Phenomena-based starting points require \"digestion\" (conversion into thought), which makes them functionally belief-based.\n- Therefore all justification reduces to justified belief.\n\nThis creates a devastating dilemma for foundationalism: if all justification is belief-based, then either (a) there are unjustified foundational beliefs (undermining foundationalism's claim that basic beliefs are justified), or (b) justification is circular. The author's treatment of circular justification in the sidenote (\"The other option: circular justified beliefs\") is particularly inventive -- arguing that accepting circularity leads to the absurd conclusion that babies must possess knowledge, requiring either instantaneous simultaneous justification, infinite chains of before-lives, or circular lives. This reductio is original and effective.\n\n### Relation to Coherentism\n\nThe author's argument that justification reduces to belief-about-belief structurally resembles coherentism (knowledge is justified by coherence with a system of beliefs). However, the author does not embrace coherentism as a solution. Instead, the reduction to belief is presented as revealing that knowledge *just is* belief -- \"what each individual believes to be correct.\" The coherentist's web of beliefs is acknowledged but treated as the only thing that exists, rather than as a theory of justification that preserves a meaningful distinction between knowledge and mere belief.\n\n### Relation to Reliabilism\n\nThe sidenote on \"Examples of justification bases\" explicitly lists \"Reliable processes\" as one category of justification base, classifying it as \"phenomena or truth.\" The author's key argument applies: whatever reliable processes are in themselves, what matters is *how we access them*. A reliable process must manifest as a phenomenon or be converted into belief to serve as a starting point for justification. This effectively neutralizes reliabilism's externalist move: even if a belief is produced by a reliable process, the epistemic agent can only use this fact insofar as it enters their phenomenal experience or belief system.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Argument that Justification Reduces to Belief\n\nThis is the central epistemological thesis of \"A Thought on Knowledge\" and arguably the most significant philosophical claim in the collection from an epistemological standpoint.\n\nThe argument proceeds in three steps:\n\n1. **Truth-based justification collapses**: We have no direct access to truth; we access only phenomena. The rain example is instructive -- to verify \"it is raining outside,\" we look outside, but we only obtain the phenomenon of potential rain (we might be deceived by a sprinkler). Therefore, truth-based starting points are, in practice, phenomena-based or belief-based.\n\n2. **Phenomena-based justification collapses**: Phenomena require \"digestion\" -- conversion into thought -- before they can serve as justification bases. The three Bob examples brilliantly illustrate this: (a) Bob uses a memory-based belief to reject a claim; (b) Bob looks outside but, deceived by a sprinkler, still relies on interpretation; (c) Bob sees rain but, absorbed in emotional reverie, does not form the belief \"it is raining\" at all. The third case is especially powerful: it shows that phenomena do not automatically become justification bases; they require active cognitive processing.\n\n3. **Therefore, all justification is belief-based**: Justification based on justified belief is \"a second order of belief (belief about belief).\"\n\nThe implications are radical:\n- **The truth condition is vacuous**: \"In practice, the only thing that exists is 'what each individual believes to be correct.'\"\n- **Knowledge is belief**: The distinction between knowledge and belief collapses in practice.\n- **Agrippa's Trilemma is resolved by accepting the first horn**: Knowledge bottoms out in unjustified belief, but this is not a deficiency -- it is simply how cognition works.\n\nThis has significant implications for epistemology as a discipline. If knowledge is just belief, then epistemology's traditional project of distinguishing knowledge from mere belief is misconceived. The productive questions become: What standards do communities use to evaluate beliefs? How do those standards change? What is their utility? The author gestures toward this in the \"Knowledge in motion\" sidenote, where the Standard Model in physics is presented as the winning belief-system according to the standard of predictive success.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The \"Access\" Argument\n\nThe sidenote titled \"Access\" and the discussion of justification bases contain what I consider one of the essay's most philosophically important moves: the shift from asking *what justification bases are* to asking *how we access them*.\n\n> \"The key point is that for each justification basis, we must think about how we access it, instead of what is it. Things that are not accessible cannot be used as a starting point in practical justification.\"\n\nThis is a methodological principle with far-reaching consequences. It applies uniformly across all proposed justification bases:\n\n- **Evidence**: If evidence is \"truth,\" it must be accessed through phenomena; if phenomena, it must be digested into belief.\n- **A priori justification**: Must manifest through shaping phenomena we experience.\n- **Innate cognitive structures**: \"manifest only through shaping phenomena we experience, thus phenomenon-based in practice.\"\n- **Reliable processes**: Must be accessible as phenomena or truth, which in turn collapse into belief.\n- **Testimony**: Known through phenomena (hearing someone speak, reading a text).\n- **Mathematical/logical principles**: In practice, accessed as justified beliefs (the sidenote \"Access to truth\" in mathematics is devastating: mathematicians prove things from starting points \"taken to be true\" using methods \"taken to be true\").\n\nThe access argument is essentially a *methodological phenomenalism* applied to epistemology. It does not claim that nothing exists beyond phenomena (that would be ontological phenomenalism); it claims that nothing beyond phenomena can function as a starting point for justification *in practice*. This is why the author repeatedly emphasizes \"in practice\" and \"in real life.\"\n\nThe philosophical significance is that this argument is largely framework-independent. It does not depend on any particular metaphysical commitments. Whether you are a realist, idealist, or pragmatist, you must still answer the question: how does your preferred justification base enter the justification process? And the author argues that the answer is always: through phenomena, which are then digested into belief.\n\nThis connects directly to the later essays' use of P (phenomenon/现象) as the \"first reality\" (第一实在). The epistemological access argument provides the groundwork for the metaphysical framework developed in \"后形而上学 整理\" (Essay #4).\n\n---\n\n## 4. The K1 Strategy's Model of Knowledge Formation (知识的发生)\n\nThe K1 strategy essay (Essay #7) develops a formal categorical model of how knowledge arises. The section \"知识的发生\" (the genesis/occurrence of knowledge) is a remarkable attempt to formalize epistemological processes using category theory.\n\n### The Knowledge Category\n\nThe author defines $(\\mathcal{E}_K)_t$ as the knowledge structure at time $t$. Objects are beliefs; morphisms are justification relations (证实关系). Crucially, the author notes that justification relations are themselves beliefs -- \"what we accept as valid argumentation\" -- maintaining consistency with the reduction of justification to belief from \"A Thought on Knowledge.\"\n\n### The Formation Process\n\nKnowledge formation proceeds through a functor:\n$$\n(F_{L \\to K})_t: (\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\to (\\mathcal{E}_K)_t\n$$\n\nThis maps linguistic structures to knowledge structures. The process:\n\n1. Through language games, a new sentence $a$ is constructed in the language category $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$.\n2. Introspection (via the functor $(F_{L \\to K})_t$) maps this sentence to a belief in the knowledge network.\n3. The knowledge category evolves: the new belief is either accepted or rejected based on whether it preserves the stable structure $S_K$.\n4. When $a$'s corresponding belief becomes an object in the evolved $(\\mathcal{E}_K)_{t'}$, \"knowledge has occurred\" (知识就发生了).\n\nThis is epistemologically significant for several reasons:\n\n- **Knowledge is processual**: Knowledge is not a static state but an event -- it \"occurs\" (发生) through the evolution of categorical structures.\n- **Language precedes knowledge**: Language games generate candidate beliefs that are then filtered through the knowledge structure. This aligns with later Wittgenstein but gives it formal structure.\n- **The knowledge structure is self-regulating**: Acceptance/rejection is determined by compatibility with the existing stable structure $S_K$, which is a form of coherentism but formalized categorically.\n- **Even rejection causes perturbation**: \"Even rejection may cause perturbation to the knowledge network\" -- this is a subtle and important point. Failed knowledge claims still affect the epistemic structure.\n\n### The Role of E_t\n\nThe functor $(F_{L \\to K})_t$ may factor through the total experiential category $\\mathbb{E}_t$:\n$$\n(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,L})_t} \\mathbb{E}_t \\xrightarrow{(F_{E,K})_{t+1}^{-1}} (\\mathcal{E}_K)_{t+2}\n$$\n\nThis means knowledge formation passes through the full experiential field. The stable structure $S_E$ of experience constrains what can become knowledge. This is a formal expression of the idea that knowledge is shaped by (and shapes) our broader experiential life.\n\n---\n\n## 5. The Stable Structure S_K and Its Epistemological Significance\n\nThe concept of stable structures preserved under evolution is perhaps the most original contribution of the K1 strategy to epistemology.\n\n### Definition and Nature\n\n$S_K$ is defined as a structure within $(\\mathcal{E}_K)_t$ that is preserved across the evolution $T$. It is what remains invariant as the knowledge category evolves through the addition and rejection of beliefs.\n\n### Epistemological Significance\n\n1. **A priori structures**: The author explicitly connects $S_E$ (the stable structure of the total experiential category) to the possibility of \"a priori cognitive structures.\" If one takes $\\mathbb{E}_{t_c}$ at the earliest moment of cognitive life, then $S_{E_c}$ (the stable structure at that point) could be identified with innate cognitive structures. If some part of $S_E$ is necessary for constructing any $\\mathbb{E}_t$ from phenomena $\\mathfrak{P}_t$, that part can be called a \"cognitive structure\" (认知结构). This is a formalization of something close to Kant's categories, but arrived at through categorical evolution rather than transcendental deduction.\n\n2. **Grammar and logic as stable structures**: The author notes that in the language category $(\\mathcal{E}_L)_t$, the stable structure corresponds to \"things like grammatical rules.\" This suggests that grammar, logic, and similar formal structures are epistemologically fundamental not because they are a priori truths, but because they are *evolutionarily stable* in the categorical sense.\n\n3. **Indirect access through language games**: Since $S_E$ is difficult to study directly, the K1 strategy proposes studying $S_L$ (the stable structure of language) and using the functor $(F_{E,L})_t$ to approximate $S_E$:\n$$\n(F_{E,L})_t(S_L) \\approx S_E\n$$\nThis provides a methodological justification for linguistic analysis in epistemology -- a formal grounding for the \"linguistic turn.\"\n\n4. **Cross-domain convergence**: By studying multiple sub-categories (language, mathematics, etc.) and their respective stable structures, we can triangulate toward $S_E$. This is methodologically powerful: it suggests that philosophical progress comes from examining the same experiential structure through multiple formal lenses.\n\n5. **Descriptive, not normative**: The author carefully notes that these stable structures are descriptive. Whether they carry metaphysical or normative weight is left open. This is epistemological modesty of the right kind.\n\n---\n\n## 6. The Meno Paradox Resolution\n\nThe Meno paradox -- if you don't know what you're looking for, how will you recognize it when you find it? If you already know, why search? -- receives a structural resolution in the K1 strategy's framework (in the KA猜想 section).\n\nThe resolution proceeds:\n1. When we cannot obtain the $\\eta$ feeling (the experience of alignment between a structure's evolution and our experiential evolution), we sense that we don't fully understand something.\n2. This failure may be due to gaps in the network (missing paths/morphisms) or due to \"tension\" (张力) -- an inability to organize the network to achieve a universal property.\n3. We therefore know \"the thing I need to learn\" exists as a structural gap or unresolved tension -- it is \"not something I have already learned\" but something whose *structural position* is partially determined by the existing network.\n4. When, through reorganizing morphisms or acquiring new concepts, the network forms a universal property and we obtain $\\eta$, \"we feel we have learned the thing we previously wanted to learn.\"\n\nThis is elegant because it resolves the paradox without positing any mysterious pre-knowledge. What we \"know\" before learning is not the content of what we will learn, but the *structural signature of its absence* -- the gaps and tensions in our current knowledge network. The object of inquiry is defined negatively, by the shape of what is missing. This is reminiscent of Polanyi's \"tacit knowledge\" but given precise categorical form.\n\nFrom a translation perspective, the phrase \"知识的发生\" is epistemologically loaded. \"发生\" means \"to happen/occur/arise\" and carries connotations of emergence and genesis. \"The occurrence of knowledge\" or \"the genesis of knowledge\" are both possibilities, but neither fully captures the dynamic, event-like quality the author intends.\n\n---\n\n## 6a. Intersubjectivity via the Natural Transformation eta\n\nThe natural transformation $\\eta$ introduced in the K1 strategy's section on natural transformations provides what is, to my knowledge, an original resolution to the epistemic problem of intersubjectivity -- how knowledge can be shared and verified between subjects.\n\n### The Problem\n\nStandard approaches to epistemic intersubjectivity each face difficulties within the author's framework:\n- **Objectivism** (intersubjectivity is guaranteed because both subjects relate to the same mind-independent truth) requires direct access to truth, which the author has ruled out via the access argument.\n- **Consensus theory** (knowledge is what a community agrees on) conflates agreement with knowledge.\n- **Testimony-based accounts** presuppose that the same words carry the same meaning for different subjects, which is precisely what needs to be explained.\n\n### The eta-Based Resolution\n\nThe natural transformation $\\eta$ provides a structural account that bypasses all three. For subject A, there is a natural transformation $\\eta^A$ aligning the evolution of some formal structure (say mathematics, $(\\mathcal{E}_M)_t$) with the evolution of A's experiential field ($\\mathbb{E}^A_t$). For subject B, there is a corresponding $\\eta^B$ doing the same for B's experiential field.\n\nThe author states explicitly in methodology point #3: \"We do not need ontological verification that different people obtained the 'same' experience (e.g., Qualia); we only need them to have the same structural position\" (我们不需要本体论的验证不同的人获得了\"同一\"体验（例如Qualia），只需要他们具有相同的结构性位置).\n\nIntersubjective verification therefore works as follows:\n1. A and B share access to a formal structure (e.g., a mathematical proof, a sentence, a piece of music).\n2. This formal structure has its own evolution (structural rules, grammar, mathematical logic).\n3. If both A and B can construct an $\\eta$ -- an alignment between this formal evolution and their respective experiential evolutions -- then their understandings are **structurally commensurable**.\n4. They do not need to share the same qualia, the same phenomenal experience, or access the same \"truth.\" They need only share the same **structural alignment pattern**.\n\n### Epistemological Significance\n\nThis resolution sidesteps the qualia problem entirely (we never need to compare inner experiences), avoids the truth-access requirement (we never need to verify against objective truth), and provides a *testable* criterion for mutual understanding (can both subjects demonstrate the same structural alignment through their responses?).\n\nThe resolution is consistent with the author's earlier epistemological moves: knowledge is belief, so intersubjective \"knowledge\" is intersubjectively aligned belief structures; access is what matters, so the check is phenomenal (I observe your behavior and outputs and check structural consistency with mine).\n\nOne important subtlety: the naturality condition requires that the alignment be *systematic*, not accidental. If two people happen to agree on a single belief, that is not intersubjective verification. The naturality condition requires that the alignment *commute with the morphisms* -- that is, the structural relationships between beliefs must also align. This is a much stronger condition than mere agreement and a much more precise account of what \"mutual understanding\" actually requires. There is a deep connection here to Sellars's \"space of reasons\" -- the author's $\\eta$ provides a formal mechanism for how two people can occupy \"the same position\" in different inferential networks without requiring that their networks be identical.\n\n**Translation note**: The term 主体间性 (intersubjectivity) does not appear explicitly in the K1 essay, but the framework clearly addresses it. A translator's footnote connecting $\\eta$ to the intersubjectivity literature would be valuable for Western readers.\n\n---\n\n## 6b. The Essays as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThe K1 strategy's methodology point #3 proposes \"philosophical experiments\" -- constructing examples that conform to a specific structure in order to awaken a specific experience in the reader, then checking whether that experience is replicable. The author claims that if an example can stably awaken the same structural experience across different readers, \"we have conducted a philosophical experiment\" (我们等同于进行了一场\"哲学实验\"). Re-reading the essays with this lens reveals that many passages function not merely as illustrations but as experiments conducted on the reader. This has significant implications for translation: the experiential sequence of these passages is load-bearing, not merely illustrative, and must be preserved precisely.\n\n### \"A Thought on Knowledge\" -- An Experiment in Epistemic Disillusionment\n\nThe three Bob examples are a carefully designed experimental sequence:\n\n- **Bob 1** (memory-based rejection): Establishes the reader's baseline experience of \"I understand how justification works.\"\n- **Bob 2** (sprinkler deception): Destabilizes the reader -- \"even looking outside doesn't give truth.\"\n- **Bob 3** (emotional reverie, no belief formed): The crucial experimental payload. The reader is asked to imagine Bob seeing rain and *not forming the belief that it is raining*. If the reader successfully inhabits this scenario, they experience the recognition that phenomena do not automatically become beliefs. This is the $\\eta$-moment: the reader's experiential evolution aligns with the essay's structural argument, and the reader \"gets it.\"\n\nThe experiment's success is checkable: does the reader, after Bob 3, feel that the distinction between phenomena and belief is *obvious* rather than merely argued? If so, a structural insight has been awakened as an experience, not just transmitted as a proposition. **Translation implication**: The three Bobs must be presented in exact sequence with their specific details preserved -- the sprinkler in Bob 2 and the emotional absorption in Bob 3 are not interchangeable decorations but structurally necessary conditions for the experiment to work.\n\n### \"西西弗斯、班与猫\" -- An Experiment in Dissolving Absurdity\n\nThis is the most clearly experimental essay in the collection. The structure is a descending sequence:\n\n1. Sisyphus (cosmic, dramatic) -- the reader experiences the standard feeling of absurdity.\n2. The office worker (societal, relatable) -- absurdity mapped onto everyday life.\n3. The entrepreneur (counterexample) -- partial dissolution; absurdity disappears when work is self-directed.\n4. The cat (mundane, intimate) -- the experimental payload.\n\nThe cat passage does not *argue* that caring for a cat is meaningful. Instead, the author constructs a vivid phenomenological description -- waking up to meowing, preparing food, dealing with fur, destroyed furniture -- and states: \"no cat owner would ever feel absurd about this.\" The experiment is: does the reader *experience* the absence of absurdity? Does connecting cat-care to absurdity itself feel absurd?\n\nIf the reader has this experience, the essay has demonstrated its thesis experientially. The reader has been placed in a 境 where absurdity cannot arise and has *felt* this impossibility. The progression from Sisyphus to the cat -- each step reducing cosmic drama -- is structurally essential: by the time we reach the cat, the question of meaning-from-outside is revealed as a category error. **Translation implication**: The descending scale (cosmic to mundane) and the accumulation of specific domestic details in the cat passage are the experiment's mechanism and must not be condensed or abstracted.\n\n### \"后形而上学 整理\" -- An Experiment in Structural Reversal\n\nThe 道德仁义礼 passage is an experiment in restructuring the reader's metaphysical understanding:\n\n1. Present the standard top-down reading: 道 generates 德, 德 generates 仁, etc.\n2. Introduce 现象礼 -- actual observable behavior.\n3. Show step by step how generation actually runs bottom-up: observe 现象礼, infer 现象义, infer 现象仁, abstract to 德, abstract to 道.\n4. Show how the bottom-up process gets \"buried\" (掩埋不见) and the top-down reading takes over.\n\nFor readers who have internalized the traditional reading, this should produce a Necker-cube-like inversion experience. For readers who have not, it constructs and immediately deconstructs the top-down reading in a single movement. Both produce an experiential verification that the reader's 境 has been restructured. **Translation implication**: The step-by-step buildup and the moment of reversal must be preserved as a continuous argumentative arc; breaking it into disconnected points would destroy the experimental effect.\n\n### Epistemological Significance\n\nThe philosophical experiment concept proposes a new form of epistemic justification -- what I would term **structural phenomenological induction**: constructing conditions designed to produce a specific experiential structure, then checking whether that structure was produced. This form of justification is:\n1. **Replicable** across subjects (different readers can undergo the same experiment)\n2. **Structurally verifiable** (we check for structural position, not identical qualia)\n3. **Fallibilist** (the experiment can fail -- a reader might not have the experience)\n4. **Non-propositional** at its core (the primary evidence is an experience, not a judgment)\n\nThis addresses a longstanding gap in epistemology: how to justify claims about the structure of experience without reducing them to propositional claims about experience. The author's answer is: by *producing* the relevant experience in a controlled way and verifying its structural features. Footnote [^2] in K1策略 is crucial: \"This is an analytic judgment about experience: if something has stable presentation in experience, it can be verified experientially.\" The author claims this is analytically true -- not an empirical hypothesis but a conceptual truth about what experiential verification means.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Translation Challenges for Epistemological Terms\n\n### Core Terms\n\n1. **知识 (zhishi)**: Straightforwardly \"knowledge,\" but the author's analysis shows that what is usually called 知识 in Chinese is closer to \"what is believed to be correct\" than to the philosophical technical term \"knowledge\" (JTB). A translator should note this tension.\n\n2. **信念 (xinnian)**: \"Belief\" -- but in Chinese philosophical usage, 信念 carries stronger connotations of conviction or commitment than the English epistemological use of \"belief\" (which can be very weak, as in \"I believe it might rain\"). The author's use in the formal framework is closer to the English technical sense.\n\n3. **证实关系 (zhengshi guanxi)**: \"Justification relation\" or \"verification relation.\" The Chinese 证实 can mean both \"justify\" and \"verify/confirm,\" and the author seems to intend both senses simultaneously. In the K1 framework, these are morphisms in the knowledge category -- they are the *connections* between beliefs that constitute epistemic structure. \"Epistemic linkage\" might capture the structural sense better, but loses the justificatory connotation.\n\n4. **现象 (xianxiang)**: \"Phenomena\" -- but the author's usage is closer to the phenomenological sense (what is given in experience) than the scientific sense (observable events). The sidenote explicitly clarifies: \"it refers to what we experience or observe.\" The translation should preserve this experiential emphasis.\n\n5. **第一实在 (di-yi shizai)**: \"First reality\" -- a term coined by the author to denote phenomena as the epistemological starting point. The footnote clarifies this is not an ontological claim about what is \"really real\" but a methodological claim about what is epistemically primary. \"Primary actuality\" or \"first actuality\" might work, though \"first reality\" is more natural.\n\n6. **知识的发生 (zhishi de fasheng)**: \"The occurrence/genesis of knowledge\" -- as noted above, this is a key phrase. \"Knowledge formation\" loses the event-character; \"the happening of knowledge\" is awkward but more faithful; \"knowledge emergence\" adds connotations of emergence theory that may not be intended.\n\n7. **稳定结构 (wending jiegou)**: \"Stable structure\" -- straightforward, but in the epistemological context, it functions as the author's replacement for concepts like \"a priori categories,\" \"cognitive frameworks,\" or \"epistemic norms.\" The translation should preserve its structural/mathematical character rather than assimilating it to existing philosophical vocabulary.\n\n8. **境 (jing)**: This is the collection's central term and the hardest to translate. In the epistemological context, it functions as \"the categorical structure over phenomena\" -- the organized experiential field within which knowledge operates. \"Sphere\" captures the boundedness; \"realm\" the experiential quality; \"field\" the structural aspect. None is fully adequate. I recommend preserving 境 as a technical term (Jing) with explanation, as its meaning is constituted by the entire theoretical framework.\n\n### Structural Challenges\n\nThe author moves fluidly between colloquial Chinese, formal philosophical Chinese, and mathematical notation. The epistemological arguments in \"A Thought on Knowledge\" are written in accessible English, while the K1 strategy's epistemological sections are in Chinese with heavy mathematical formalism. A translator must navigate:\n\n- The shift from everyday examples (rain, Bob) to formal categorical structures\n- The author's deliberate avoidance of standard philosophical terminology (the author often coins terms rather than using established philosophical Chinese, and explicitly warns readers about this in Essay #4)\n- The interplay between Chinese philosophical concepts (道德仁义礼) and Western epistemological frameworks\n- Mathematical notation that carries philosophical meaning (functors as \"introspection,\" morphisms as \"justification relations\")\n\n---\n\n## 8. Overall Significance for Epistemology\n\n### What Is Achieved\n\n1. **A practice-first epistemology**: The author consistently asks \"what happens in practice?\" rather than \"what is conceptually possible?\" This is not mere pragmatism -- it is a principled methodological stance grounded in the access argument. Knowledge is analyzed as it actually functions in human cognitive life, not as an idealized abstract relation.\n\n2. **The dissolution of the JTB framework**: The author does not add a fourth condition to JTB (as in most post-Gettier epistemology) or reject one condition. Instead, the author shows that truth and justification both reduce to belief in practice, making the tripartite analysis a distinction without a difference. This is more radical than most contemporary epistemological positions.\n\n3. **A formal framework for epistemic dynamics**: The K1 strategy provides what analytic epistemology has largely lacked: a formal model of how knowledge *changes over time*. The evolution functor $T$, the stable structures $S_K$, and the natural transformation $\\eta$ provide precise tools for analyzing epistemic processes. This is epistemology as a theory of epistemic *processes* rather than epistemic *states*.\n\n4. **The naturalization of a priori structures**: By identifying potential \"a priori cognitive structures\" as stable structures under categorical evolution, the author provides a framework that is compatible with both Kantian and naturalistic epistemology. The a priori is not transcendentally deduced but empirically identified (through its invariance under evolution).\n\n5. **A resolution of the Meno paradox**: The structural-gap account of inquiry is original, precise, and satisfying. It shows how one can seek what one does not yet know by being sensitive to the structural features of one's own ignorance.\n\n6. **Bridging analytic and continental epistemology**: The collection moves between phenomenological analysis (phenomena as first reality, the role of lived experience) and formal/analytic methods (category theory, logical analysis of JTB). This is rare and valuable.\n\n### Limitations and Open Questions\n\n1. **The reduction of justification to belief** is powerful but may be too quick. One might argue that the \"digestion\" of phenomena into belief is itself a justificatory process -- that perception justifies belief precisely through the process of digestion, even if the result is a belief. The author's argument may conflate the *vehicle* of justification (always a mental state, hence belief-like) with the *source* of justification (which may be external).\n\n2. **The stable structure $S_K$** is postulated but not identified. The author acknowledges this: \"we might have difficulty finding it.\" The framework is promissory -- its value will depend on whether $S_K$ can be characterized concretely.\n\n3. **The relationship between the access argument and externalism** deserves further development. The access argument seems to rule out externalist epistemologies (reliabilism, proper functionalism), but the K1 framework's use of stable structures that agents may not be aware of reintroduces something like externalist elements.\n\n4. **The KA conjecture** remains a \"Todo\" -- the author explicitly marks this as unfinished. The conjecture aims to derive the A1 strategy's definition of metaphysical concepts as universal properties from the K1 framework, which would unify the epistemological and metaphysical parts of the project.\n\n### Historical Positioning\n\nThe author's epistemological position is closest to:\n- **Quine's naturalized epistemology** in its rejection of a priori justification and its focus on how knowledge actually works\n- **Wittgenstein's later philosophy** in the role of language games and the dissolution of traditional philosophical problems\n- **Kant's transcendental philosophy** in the search for conditions of possibility of knowledge (stable structures)\n- **Pragmatism (James, Dewey)** in the emphasis on practice and the redefinition of knowledge in terms of utility and communal standards\n\nBut the author's use of category theory to formalize these insights is genuinely novel. The combination of phenomenological starting points, deflationary analysis of JTB, and categorical formalization of epistemic dynamics represents an original contribution to epistemology that does not fit neatly into any existing school.\n\nThe collection as a whole traces a philosophical journey from high school metaphysical reflections (Essay #4, dated framework) through the resolution of nihilism via \"poetic\" engagement (Essay #5), to a mature formal framework (Essays #6-7) that provides tools for analyzing knowledge, understanding, meaning, and experience. The epistemological thread -- from the access argument through the reduction of knowledge to belief through the categorical formalization of knowledge formation -- is the collection's most technically developed philosophical contribution.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":289,"oldLines":6,"newStart":289,"newLines":10,"lines":[" "," 6. **Bridging analytic and continental epistemology**: The collection moves between phenomenological analysis (phenomena as first reality, the role of lived experience) and formal/analytic methods (category theory, logical analysis of JTB).

Two subjects need not share the same inner experience or access the same objective truth; they need only achieve the same structural alignment between a shared formal structure and their respective experiential evolutions. The naturality condition ensures this alignment is systematic rather than accidental, providing a more precise account of \"mutual understanding\" than consensus or testimony-based approaches.","+","+8. **A new form of epistemic justification via philosophical experiments**: The concept of structural phenomenological induction -- constructing conditions to produce a specific experiential structure and checking for replication -- addresses a longstanding gap in epistemology concerning the justification of claims about experiential structure.
