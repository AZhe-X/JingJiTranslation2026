*Confirming 诗意 resolution: *

The author endorses the current resolution for 诗意 (shiyi):

- **"the poetic"** as the standard substantive form
- **"poetic"** as adjective
- **"poeticality"** acceptable as an occasional variant noun
- **Capitalize "the Poetic"** in the translator's introduction and glossary to signal philosophical weight

Does everyone still agree with this resolution? Any second thoughts now that we've been through the full dictionary discussion? Concise yes/no + any brief additions.

Agreed with the resolution, added a note that capitalization should extend to the main text when "the Poetic" refers to the author's technical concept, following the precedent of capitalizing "the Sublime" and "the Beautiful" in Kant's third Critique. Standing by.
