In your analysis process:\n\n1. Chronologically analyze each message and section of the conversation. For each section thoroughly identify:\n   - The user's explicit requests and intents\n   - Your approach to addressing the user's requests\n   - Key decisions, technical concepts and code patterns\n   - Specific details like:\n     - file names\n     - full code snippets\n     - function signatures\n     - file edits\n  - Errors that you ran into and how you fixed them\n  - Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.\n2. Double-check for technical accuracy and completeness, addressing each required element thoroughly.\n\nYour summary should include the following sections:\n\n1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture all of the user's explicit requests and intents in detail\n2. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, and frameworks discussed.\n3. Files and Code Sections: Enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created. Pay special attention to the most recent messages and include full code snippets where applicable and include a summary of why this file read or edit is important.\n4. Errors and fixes: List all errors that you ran into, and how you fixed them. Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.\n5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.\n6. All user messages: List ALL user messages that are not tool results. These are critical for understanding the users' feedback and changing intent.\n6. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks that you have explicitly been asked to work on.\n7. Current Work: Describe in detail precisely what was being worked on immediately before this summary request, paying special attention to the most recent messages from both user and assistant. Include file names and code snippets where applicable.\n8. Optional Next Step: List the next step that you will take that is related to the most recent work you were doing. IMPORTANT: ensure that this step is DIRECTLY in line with the user's most recent explicit requests, and the task you were working on immediately before this summary request. If your last task was concluded, then only list next steps if they are explicitly in line with the users request. Do not start on tangential requests or really old requests that were already completed without confirming with the user first.\n                       If there is a next step, include direct quotes from the most recent conversation showing exactly what task you were working on and where you left off. This should be verbatim to ensure there's no drift in task interpretation.\n\nHere's an example of how your output should be structured:\n\n<example>\n<analysis>\n[Your thought process, ensuring all points are covered thoroughly and accurately]\n</analysis>\n\n<summary>\n1.

Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user wants to carefully translate a collection of philosophical essays called 境集 (Jing Ji) from Chinese to English. The collection contains 8 essays covering post-metaphysics, category theory, epistemology, existentialism, and more. Due to the difficulty of translating philosophical terms that span Chinese, Western, and Buddhist traditions, the user requested a consultant team of domain experts to first analyze the essays, identify translation challenges, and establish consensus on key terminology before beginning translation. The overall workflow is: (1) read all essays, (2) assemble expert team, (3) have experts analyze and produce reports, (4) review reports to ensure alignment, (5) translate essay by essay with expert consultation.\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - 境集 (Jing Ji) - a collection of 8 philosophical essays by author Xueqi Li\n   - Post-metaphysics (后形而上学) - the author's framework for philosophy after nihilism\n   - Category theory used as formal language for phenomenological structures\n   - Three-reality schema: 第一实在 (First Reality/phenomena), 第二实在 (Second Reality/constructions), 第〇实在 (Zeroth Reality/unreachable ultimate)\n   - 境 (Jing/E) - structured experiential space formalized as a category on phenomena\n   - 诗意 (the Poetic) - lucid engagement with constructed meaning-structures\n   - K1 strategy - using natural transformations to describe understanding\n   - Evolution functors, stable structures S_E, tower structures\n   - Team \"jing-translation\" with 8 expert agents\n\n3.

Errors and fixes:\n   - Background Task agents (a1405ef, a0b371d) dispatched to write reports could not access conversation history (they start fresh without prior context). Fix: I wrote the reports directly myself using the Write tool.\n   - First attempt to write to subdirectories (`49 Workspace/Metaphysics/Analysis Report.md`) failed because files hadn't been read first. Fix: wrote to root workspace directory instead (user also requested \"let write it in root workspace directory\"). The experts themselves later successfully wrote their full reports to the subdirectories.\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - Successfully assembled and coordinated an 8-expert team for philosophical analysis\n   - All 8 experts completed their analyses and saved reports\n   - Cross-expert consensus was established on key translation terms\n   - Key consensus: 境→\"Jing\" (romanized), 诗意→\"the Poetic\", 恒常→\"Constancy\", 非理性→\"the non-rational\", 德→\"De\"/\"inherent character\" (NOT \"virtue\"), 虚无→\"the void\" (NOT śūnyatā)\n\n6.

Pending Tasks:\n   - User needs to review the 8 expert analysis reports in 49 Workspace to confirm alignment (\"so i know we have landed the same place\")\n   - After review/alignment, begin the actual essay-by-essay English translation of 境集\n   - The translation should be done \"one by one\" (essay by essay) and \"carefully\"\n   - 8 expert agents are idle and available for consultation during translation phase\n\n8. Current Work:\n   All 8 expert analyses are complete and saved. The user confirmed they want to compact the conversation to free context window space. I confirmed compacting is safe - it won't affect the team agents. The user is about to review the reports in 49 Workspace before we begin translation work.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Wait for user to review the expert reports and confirm alignment. Then begin essay-by-essay translation of 境集, consulting experts as needed on difficult terms. The user said: \"we need to translate it to english, and we need to do that carefully... we will do that one by one.\" The team name is \"jing-translation\" and all 8 experts (metaphysics-expert, phenomenology-expert, epistemology-expert, existentialism-expert, phil-mind-expert, kantian-expert, chinese-phil-expert, buddhism-expert) are idle and available.\n</summary>"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1147,"cache_read_input_tokens":190609,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":1147},"output_tokens":3,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CXznpqeqRiNmgdM1rZSgg","type":"assistant","uuid":"5f11f300-b27f-4142-9b15-1cc4789983e3","timestamp":"2026-02-10T17:35:37.027Z"}
