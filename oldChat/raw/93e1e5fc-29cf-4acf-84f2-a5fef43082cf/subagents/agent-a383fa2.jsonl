Please review and respond with whether you AGREE, or if you want to ADD, CHANGE, or REMOVE anything.\n\nProposed profile:\n1. Native-level command of both Chinese and English\n2. Philosophical training (not purely literary)\n3. Literary sensibility (not purely academic)\n4. Category theory / mathematical notation literacy\n5. Experience with register shifts (colloquial ↔ technical ↔ poetic)\n6. Translator models: Burton Watson, A.C. Graham, Brook Ziporyn\n\nPlease respond with:\n- AGREE (if you're satisfied with the profile as-is)\n- Or specific additions/changes/removals with justification\n\nThis is discussion time -- if you disagree with another expert's suggestion, say so. We want consensus before proceeding.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"1e0d536c-42bc-4726-9a11-2013a4fdd963","timestamp":"2026-02-10T21:36:51.674Z"}
