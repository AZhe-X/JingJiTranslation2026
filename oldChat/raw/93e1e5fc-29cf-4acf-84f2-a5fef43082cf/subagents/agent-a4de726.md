*Reminder: 文言 format applies to Laozi quote too*

Reminder from the author — we already agreed (10/10 unanimous) on the Classical Chinese Quotation Format:

1. Present original 文言 text as a **block quote**
2. Follow with **glossed English translation** — key terms glossed on first occurrence as "English (漢字, pinyin)", e.g., "humaneness (仁, ren)"
3. After first introduction, use **plain English only**
4. 现象X compounds keep "phenomenal" prefix always

This means for the Laozi block quote, the format would be:

> [Original Chinese block quote]
> "When the Way (道, dao) was lost there was virtue (德, de); when virtue was lost there was humaneness (仁, ren); when humaneness was lost there was rightness (义, yi); when rightness was lost there was ritual conduct (礼, li)."

Then in the author's analysis, plain English: "humaneness," "rightness," "ritual conduct" — with 德 shifting to "(constitutive) character" as decided.

Given THIS format — where the glossed English already includes the Chinese characters and pinyin at first occurrence — does the question of "the Way" vs "Dao" still matter? The reader sees "the Way (道, dao)" and has both. 

Reconsider your answer on 道 with this format in mind. Should it be "the Way (道, dao)" or "Dao (道)" in the glossed block quote? One word answer.

{
  "type": "message",
  "recipient": "team-lead",
  "summary": "Dao (道) — still prefer romanized",
  "content": "**\"Dao (道)\"**\n\nThe gloss format resolves the information problem either way, but the running-text question remains: after the block quote, when the author analyzes 道 across multiple paragraphs, will the reader see \"the Way\" or \"Dao\"? If we use \"the Way\" in the quote, we either switch to \"Dao\" in the analysis (same split problem) or commit to \"the Way\" throughout (which is fine but less standard in contemporary scholarship -- Van Norden, Slingerland, and Ziporyn all use \"Dao\" in running text now). \"Dao (道)\" in the quote flows seamlessly into \"Dao\" in the analysis. One less transition to manage.\n"
