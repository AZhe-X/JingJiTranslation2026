The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n    17→\n    18→No single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art.

This dual formation -- Chinese philosophical inheritance and scientific training -- is not incidental to the text. Physics concepts recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n    31→\n    32→The author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience.

Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n    45→\n    46→This is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of confronting the absurd through increasingly familiar examples. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n    47→\n    48→We recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.

The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n    55→\n    56→We have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n    57→\n    58→We have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2, and three translator's footnotes within it connect its key terms to the formal apparatus of Part 2.\n    59→\n    60→---\n    61→\n    62→## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n    63→\n    64→A note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n    65→\n    66→The Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n    67→\n    68→> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n    69→> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n    70→\n    71→In its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n    72→\n    73→The author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n    74→\n    75→This reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n    76→\n    77→A footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n    78→\n    79→---\n    80→\n    81→## A Note on Terminology\n    82→\n    83→These essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary, and the full rationale for each translation choice is provided in the Introduction to the Glossary at the end of this volume. Three points deserve advance mention here. First, the author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (\"the metaphysical\" -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (\"metaphysics\" -- the discipline that studies such constructions); we render these distinctly throughout. Second, two key concepts -- the Poetic (诗意, *shiyi*), the author's term for lucid engagement with meaning-structures, and the non-rational (非理性), the acknowledged ground of all rational activity -- are central to the collection's argument and may surprise readers expecting standard philosophical usage. Third, the reader will encounter two different English words for the same Chinese character within a single passage: 德 appears as \"virtue\" when quoting Laozi and as \"character\" when the author analyzes the concept. This is deliberate -- it reflects the author's argument that the traditional reading conceals the constructive process the essay exposes. The Glossary Introduction explains this and all other terminological decisions in full.\n    84→\n    85→---\n    86→\n    87→## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n    88→\n    89→This collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it. This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n    90→\n    91→Three examples, among many:\n    92→\n    93→In Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order, progressing from the mythic to the mundane. The progression itself is the philosophical payload: by the final example, the reader is invited to test the essay's claim against their own experience. The recognition that follows -- which cannot be produced by argument alone -- is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n    94→\n    95→In Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n    96→\n    97→In Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n    98→\n    99→We have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter. This is not a stylistic preference but a philosophical necessity: if the reader's experience is the evidence for the author's claims, then a translation that preserves the words but fails to produce the experience has lost the argument. In these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n   100→\n   101→---\n   102→\n   103→## A Note on Reading\n   104→\n   105→The author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n   106→\n   107→The three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n   108→\n   109→Readers without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n   110→\n   111→---\n   112→\n   113→*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.

This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order, progressing from the mythic to the mundane. The progression itself is the philosophical payload: by the final example, the reader is invited to test the essay's claim against their own experience. The recognition that follows -- which cannot be produced by argument alone -- is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter. This is not a stylistic preference but a philosophical necessity: if the reader's experience is the evidence for the author's claims, then a translation that preserves the words but fails to produce the experience has lost the argument. In these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation. Terminological decisions are discussed in full in the Introduction to the Glossary.*\n","numLines":114,"startLine":1,"totalLines":114}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"ecb7e686-1dce-4175-aac3-2d916903936f"}

Framed as **convergences, not influences**.\n\n**Kantian parallels:**\n- The meaning question as \"another kind of Kantian question\" (the author's own phrase in the Appendix)\n- S_E as conditions of possible experience\n- The departure from Kant's fixed transcendental apparatus toward an evolving, constructive one\n- The dispensability of Zeroth Reality (第〇实在) vs. Kant's Ding an sich as necessary limiting concept (Grenzbegriff) -- the author's Zeroth Reality loses its special position entirely through disenchantment (祛魅), enabling the post-metaphysical turn\n- The stronger claim: any articulation of Zeroth Reality constitutes it as Second Reality (construction) -- more radical than Kant's epistemic inaccessibility\n- Intersubjectivity: mention in passing as transcendental conditions for shared experience, cross-reference to Philosophy of Mind section for full treatment\n\n*(Amendment source: Kantian expert -- Zeroth Reality vs Ding an sich; Metaphysics expert -- self-undermining formulation)*\n\n**Phenomenological connections:**\n- Phenomena as starting point (cf. Husserl's Lebenswelt)\n- The relationship between Jing and intentional constitution\n- Departures from Heidegger's ontological project\n- The author's greater agentiveness compared to Heidegger's poetic dwelling\n- The tower structure (塔式结构) as the formal expression of the infinite iterability of phenomenological reflection\n- Eta/natural transformation as a formalization of Husserl's concept of fulfilled intention (erfullte Intention) -- when eta is identity, meaning-intention is perfectly filled\n- The author's 第一实在 as pre-categorical (closer to Husserl's \"manifold of intuition\" before synthesis than to Kant's already-constituted Erscheinung)\n\n*(Amendment source: Phenomenology expert -- tower as iterability, eta as fulfilled intention, First Reality as pre-categorical)*\n\n**Existentialist positioning:**\n- The Poetic compared with Nietzsche's amor fati, Camus's revolt, Heidegger's Gelassenheit -- and how it differs from all three\n- The \"livability\" of the author's post-nihilistic stance: the cat-raiser, the coin-flipper, the ritual-performer as figures of everyday life, not philosophical heroes -- contrasting with Nietzsche's Ubermensch, Camus's absurd hero, and Kierkegaard's knight of faith\n- The intoxicated/lucid dreamscape distinction as resolution of the authenticity/bad faith problematic: 沉醉 maps onto Sartre's mauvaise foi and Heidegger's das Man; 清醒 resolves the problem of being both aware of contingency and committed to one's projects. The ritual analogy (burning incense knowing it doesn't reach the dead, yet the act genuinely conveys grief) is more elegant than Sartre's underdeveloped \"pure reflection\" or Kierkegaard's \"knight of faith\"\n- The critique of Heidegger's Being-toward-death: one's own death is transcendent to oneself, therefore Being-toward-death always presupposes a metaphysical framework\n- Intersubjectivity (existentialist framing): Sartre's adversarial Look vs. the author's structural commensurability via eta (cross-reference Philosophy of Mind for full treatment)\n- The author's 诗人 (poet) vs. Heidegger's Dichter -- a significant departure with five dimensions: (1) universal vs. singular (\"我们\"/we -- everyone is a poet, not a rare chosen figure like Holderlin); (2) creator vs. receiver (paired with 创造者 -- the poet *makes*, not receives Being's disclosure); (3) self-directed vs. community-founding (\"自己生命和感受的诗人\" -- poet of one's own life, not founding dwelling for a historical people); (4) medium-indifferent vs. language-bound (any medium works -- desk arrangement, photography, cooking, memes -- language has no priority); (5) already-doing-it vs. called-to-it (\"我们已经、正在、且也将继续\" -- the task is to *notice*, not to become). The key shift: from \"How do I become authentic?\" to \"How do I notice that I already am?\" This is the capstone of the existentialist comparison and connects to the Afterword's closing gesture.\n\n*(Amendment source: Existentialism expert -- dreamscape/bad faith, Being-toward-death critique, eta as intersubjectivity, poet/Dichter finding. 11/11 voted Afterword.)*\n\n**Buddhist structural parallels:**\n- Madhyamaka middle way (pre-metaphysics/nihilism/post-metaphysics paralleling eternalism/nihilism/middle way)\n- Yogacara visaya and the constructed object-domain\n- Chan awakening stages (\"mountains are mountains again\")\n- The Diamond Sutra dream-simile and 梦境\n- Hua-yen's Indra's net (因陀羅網) and the tower structure -- mutual interpenetration at every level as the closest Buddhist structural analog to the category-theoretic framework\n- Pratityasamutpada as relational constitution\n- The author's \"already doing it\" (我们已经、正在、且也将继续) as parallel to Chan/Zen Buddha-nature (佛性) and 见性 (seeing one's nature): the insight that what is sought is already present, not something to be attained from outside. The author's universalization of the poet-figure (\"我们正是这样的创造者\") resonates with the Chan teaching that all beings already possess Buddha-nature -- the practice is recognition, not acquisition.\n\n*(Amendment source: Buddhism expert -- Hua-yen/Indra's net, Chan/Zen Buddha-nature parallel with poet/Dichter finding)*\n\n**Wittgensteinian resonances:**\n- Language games and forms of life\n- Showing vs. saying\n- The therapeutic method and its relationship to the author's philosophical experiments\n- The natural transformation eta as giving mathematical content to Wittgenstein's beetle-in-the-box insight (PI section 293): private content drops out, structural role is what matters\n- A structural (rather than communitarian) solution to the rule-following problem (addressing Kripkenstein's skepticism and the private language argument simultaneously)\n- Note for drafter: \"structural\" here means category-theoretic naturality conditions, not linguistic structuralism (Saussure)\n\n*(Drafting note source: Wittgenstein expert -- disambiguation of \"structural\")*\n\n**Chinese philosophical tradition:**\n- The radical reinterpretation of 形, 德, and the Dao-De hierarchy\n- Xunzi's 礼论 as the closest classical precedent -- and the point at which the author surpasses it by extending constructivism to 道 itself (Xunzi argued 礼 is 人为/human-made but never extended this to 道)\n- The Zhuangzi-Huizi 子非鱼 dialogue as the classical framing of the intersubjectivity problem the author's natural transformation addresses (Zhuangzi raises the problem, the Confucian tradition assumes it away via shared human nature/性善, the author resolves it structurally)\n- The relationship to Neo-Confucian 理/气 discussions and Wang Yangming's 知行合一 (handle with care: present as convergences the reader might explore, not as influences or direct engagement -- the author never explicitly invokes Wang Yangming)\n- The 意境 aesthetic tradition and the concept of 诗意\n- The Zhuangzi's 庄周梦蝶\n- How this work departs from both Confucian and Daoist orthodoxy while remaining recognizably within the Chinese philosophical tradition\n- Relationship to the commentarial tradition (Heshang Gong, Wang Bi) and Xunzi's 礼论\n\n*(Amendment source: Chinese-phil expert -- Xunzi as precedent, 子非鱼 as intersubjectivity framing; drafting note on Wang Yangming caution)*\n\n**Philosophy of Mind:**\n- The natural transformation (eta) model of understanding as the framework's most significant formal innovation\n- The other-minds argument in Essay 4 (first-person/third-person asymmetry in access to mental states as the mechanism that conceals bottom-up construction)\n- Intersubjectivity via shared eta-structure (structural commensurability without shared qualia) -- the primary home for the full intersubjectivity treatment, with connections to:\n  - Zahavi's empathy as other-directed intentionality (shared eta)\n  - Gallese's shared manifold hypothesis (shared eta in sensorimotor subcategory)\n  - Brandom's inferentialism (shared eta in language subcategory)\n- The tower structure as a model of meta-cognition (cf. Higher-Order Thought theories)\n- The \"philosophical experiment\" methodology as parallel to Varela's neurophenomenology\n- The \"basket\" metaphor and cognitive closure (McGinn)\n\n*(Amendment source: Phil-mind expert -- eta as primary phil-mind contribution, intersubjectivity consolidated here, Zahavi/Gallese/Brandom connections)*\n\n### Section C: The Experiential Method Revisited (~500 words)\n\nThe full descriptions softened in the Preface, now stated openly:\n\n- The Essay 3 sequence analyzed in detail: why the cat example works, how the progression from externalized to internally generated meaning demonstrates that absurdity is structural, not existential\n- The significance of the method: philosophical experiments that construct a Jing for the reader\n- Precedents in Mencius (孺子入井), Zhuangzi's parables, Chan 转语 (turning words), Wittgenstein's therapeutic method\n- The author's category-theoretic formalization of experiential method as genuinely novel\n- The self-referential dimension: the collection itself is a philosophical experiment on the reader; the descriptions ARE performances -- explaining the method IS demonstrating it (cf. Tractatus 4.112, PI section 133)\n- The \"two questions\" from the Appendix: \"How is philosophy possible?\" and \"How is meaning possible?\" as the collection's guiding questions, with the second connected to Kant's question about synthetic a priori knowledge (as the author explicitly invites)\n\n*(Drafting note source: Wittgenstein expert -- descriptions are performances; Translator-2 -- two questions from Appendix)*\n\n### Section D: Translation as Philosophical Practice (~400 words)\n\nKey translation decisions that embody philosophical arguments:\n\n- The 德 virtue/character split as enactment of the author's argument\n- The \"phenomenal X\" apparatus and its philosophical motivation\n- The meme substitution in Essay 7 (experiential fidelity over literal accuracy)\n- The choice to leave 境 untranslated\n- The principle stated in the Preface -- \"the experience *is* the argument\" -- as the governing translation philosophy\n- What was lost and what was gained in the crossing between languages\n\n### Section E: What Remains Open (~300 words)\n\nHonest acknowledgment of the collection's incompleteness and open questions:\n\n- The working-draft character of the Part 2 essays (todo markers, the KA conjecture)\n- The question of whether stable structures S_E have normative implications\n- The relationship to other formal frameworks (HoTT, topos theory)\n- The question of cultural relativity of stable structures\n- The underdeveloped treatment of temporality (inner time-consciousness not yet captured by the discrete evolution functor) and embodiment (the lived body as site of experience)\n- The bootstrapping problem (how do two E-structures become coordinated?)\n- Whether S_K can be concretely characterized (the KA conjecture is currently promissory)\n- An honest note on limits: the framework's individualist starting point may miss the essentially communal character of meaning that Wittgenstein emphasizes (forms of life, agreement in practice). The author addresses intersubjectivity through structural correspondence, but the starting point is always the individual subject's E_t. This is a productive tension, not a flaw.\n- The mathematical apparatus may create new confusions even as it resolves old ones\n\n*(Amendment source: Wittgenstein expert -- communal meaning as productive tension; Epistemology expert -- KA conjecture as promissory)*\n\n### Closing (~100 words)\n\nReturn the reader to their own experience. Echo the author's closing gesture in the Appendix (写在最后): we are all already constructing Jing in our daily lives. The best way to test this framework is not to evaluate its formal apparatus but to notice, in the course of an ordinary day, whether you recognize the structures it describes.\n\n*(Source: Wittgenstein expert -- closing should return reader to experience, not end on scholarly commentary)*\n\n### Optional Addition: Suggestions for Further Reading\n\nBrief pointers to:\n- Husserl, *The Crisis of European Sciences*\n- Heidegger, \"Building Dwelling Thinking\"\n- Wittgenstein, *Philosophical Investigations*\n- The Diamond Sutra\n- Mencius\n- The *Daodejing*\n\n*(Source: Phenomenology expert)*\n\n---\n\n## Process Notes\n\n- This blueprint was produced through an 11-member team process: 9 domain experts + 2 translators + 1 editor.\n- Each team member submitted an individual spoiler resolution plan; the editor synthesized these into a unified proposal.\n- The unified proposal was broadcast, debated, and revised through formal AGREE/AMEND voting.\n- Final consensus: 11/11 AGREE on the Afterword blueprint and all Preface edits.\n- Two registered non-blocking dissents on Preface edits (not affecting the Afterword):\n  - Metaphysics expert: preferred softening Edit 4 (Essay 4 reversal detail) -- outvoted 8-2\n  - Translator-2: preferred keeping specific case listing in Edit 3 (Essay 3) -- outvoted 10-1\n- The Afterword will be drafted after the full translation is further along, using this blueprint as the structural guide.\n- All accepted amendments are attributed to their sources throughout this document.\n","numLines":202,"startLine":1,"totalLines":202}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"648026bc-1990-4a9e-a7ca-0865007a461d"}
