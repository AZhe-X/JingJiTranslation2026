The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.\n\nAnalysis:\nLooking at the conversation history, this is the first user message in the conversation. The user is requesting a detailed summary of the conversation so far. However, there is no prior conversation context to summarize - this summary request is the very first interaction. There are no previous user requests, no files examined or modified, no errors encountered, no code written, and no ongoing tasks.\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user's only request so far is to create a detailed summary of the conversation. This is the first message in the conversation, so there is no prior context to summarize.\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - No technical concepts have been discussed yet.\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n   - No files have been examined, modified, or created.\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - No errors have been encountered.\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - No problems have been solved or are being troubleshot.\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - The user's first and only message is a request to create a detailed summary of the conversation so far, with specific formatting instructions and structure requirements.\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - No pending tasks have been identified or assigned.\n\n8. Current Work:\n   No work was being performed prior to this summary request. This is the beginning of the conversation.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   No next step is applicable. The conversation has just started with the summary request itself, and there are no prior tasks or user requests to continue working on. Awaiting the user's first actionable request.\n\nIf you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/el/.claude/projects/-Users-el-Dropbox-10-Kernel-11-Vault-Tower/93e1e5fc-29cf-4acf-84f2-a5fef43082cf.jsonl\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions.

This would:\n- Cut the Preface to ~1,700 words\n- Create a clean narrative arc: title → author → structure → bilingual nature → 形 reinterpretation → experiential sequences → reading advice\n- Put terminology discussion where readers will actually consult it — adjacent to the glossary itself\n- Make the Preface something a reader actually reads cover-to-cover before Essay 1\n\n**Two smaller trims also suggested:**\n1. Cut the working-draft quality paragraph from the Author section (~80 words) — redundant with Fish/Fishing section and Reading Note.\n2. Simplify the Bilingual Collection forward references (~40 words) — \"digestion,\" \"knowledge sub-category\" are forward references that confuse first-time readers.

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n    15→\n    16→集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n    17→\n    18→No single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n    19→\n    20→The author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n    21→\n    22→We treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n    23→\n    24→The \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n    25→\n    26→---\n    27→\n    28→## The Author\n    29→\n    30→The author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by vocation. This dual formation is not incidental to the text. Physics metaphors recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n    31→\n    32→The author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n    33→\n    34→The collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n    35→\n    36→---\n    37→\n    38→## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n    39→\n    40→The collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n    41→\n    42→- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n    43→- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n    44→- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n    45→\n    46→The division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n    47→\n    48→This is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n    49→\n    50→We recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n    51→\n    52→---\n    53→\n    54→## A Bilingual Collection\n    55→\n    56→One of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n    57→\n    58→We have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n    59→\n    60→We have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework.

The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n    90→\n    91→### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n    92→\n    93→The author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n    94→\n    95→### Phenomena (现象)\n    96→\n    97→The author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n    98→\n    99→### Constancy (恒常)\n   100→\n   101→The drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n   102→\n   103→### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n   104→\n   105→The author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n   106→\n   107→### The Poetic (诗意)\n   108→\n   109→The author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n   110→\n   111→\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n   112→\n   113→To make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n   114→\n   115→Readers familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n   116→\n   117→### Dreamscape (梦境)\n   118→\n   119→The author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not grounded in inherent existence, functional within its own terms.\n   120→\n   121→### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n   122→\n   123→The author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n   124→\n   125→### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n   126→\n   127→In Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n   128→\n   129→A critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n   130→\n   131→The remaining terms: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" (following Ames and Rosemont), emphasizing the inner feeling over the behavioral expression. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness,\" capturing the motivational disposition rather than the moral judgment that \"righteousness\" implies. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension.\n   132→\n   133→The author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument.\n   134→\n   135→### Three Realities\n   136→\n   137→The author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n   138→\n   139→- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n   140→- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n   141→- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n   142→\n   143→The numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\"\n   144→\n   145→### Other Terms\n   146→\n   147→**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; \"the off-tone\" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n   148→\n   149→A complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n   150→\n   151→---\n   152→\n   153→## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n   154→\n   155→This collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it.\n   156→\n   157→Three examples, among many:\n   158→\n   159→In Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n   160→\n   161→In Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n   162→\n   163→In Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n   164→\n   165→We have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter -- because in these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n   166→\n   167→---\n   168→\n   169→## A Note on Reading\n   170→\n   171→The author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n   172→\n   173→The three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n   174→\n   175→Readers without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone.

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by vocation. This dual formation is not incidental to the text. Physics metaphors recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\nThe collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\nTo make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n\nReaders familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not grounded in inherent existence, functional within its own terms.\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" (following Ames and Rosemont), emphasizing the inner feeling over the behavioral expression. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness,\" capturing the motivational disposition rather than the moral judgment that \"righteousness\" implies. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument.\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\"\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; \"the off-tone\" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter -- because in these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n\n---\n\n## Glossary\n\n*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n","numLines":186,"startLine":1,"totalLines":186}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"8e2a8ef8-73d7-4008-bf5a-c9e79e920ab1"}

Key structural observations:\n    10→\n    11→- **Two-part structure plus appendix:**\n    12→  - Part 1: 上集：鱼 (Upper Collection: Fish) — 3 essays, informal/essayistic, each can be read independently\n    13→  - Part 2: 下集：渔 (Lower Collection: Fishing) — 4 essays, more systematic/methodological, strongly interlinked, described as working drafts\n    14→  - Appendix: 1 essay of scattered thoughts\n    15→\n    16→- **鱼/渔 (Fish/Fishing) metaphor**: This is a deliberate allusion to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔 (\"give a man a fish vs. teach him to fish\"). Part 1 gives concrete philosophical reflections (the fish); Part 2 reveals the methodology behind them (the fishing). This structural metaphor is load-bearing and must be preserved in translation.\n    17→\n    18→- **Reading order is prescribed**: The author notes that the essays were written at different times and are NOT arranged chronologically, but the given order is recommended. This confirms that sequencing is philosophically intentional.\n    19→\n    20→- **Part 2 caveat**: The author warns that concepts and terminology differ from established philosophical traditions — \"需要注意甄别以免混淆\" (one must carefully distinguish to avoid confusion). This is a critical signal for translation: standard philosophical glosses may mislead.\n    21→\n    22→- **Title 境集**: 境 (jing) is a term with enormous range — boundary, realm, situation, state, environment, condition (Buddhist: visaya/gocara). The title itself is a translation challenge. Provisional: leave as romanized \"Jing Ji\" with a translator's note, or find an English rendering after full reading.\n    23→\n    24→---\n    25→\n    26→## Essay Reading Notes\n    27→\n    28→### Essay 1: 关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一\n    29→**\"A Brief Thought on Collective Interest, Part One\"**\n    30→\n    31→**Summary:** The essay examines whether \"collective interest\" (集体利益) genuinely exists or is merely an aggregate of individual interests. The author resolves this by analogy to renormalization (重整化) in physics: just as macroscopic phenomena (ocean waves) emerge from microscopic dynamics (water molecules), collective interest is a well-defined (良定义) emergent phenomenon at a different scale. The essay then argues that individuals can only understand others from their own individual standpoint — this is what makes empathy possible. Laws function like temperature: they act on microscopic individuals but have macroscopic (collective) effects.\n    32→\n    33→**Translation challenges:**\n    34→- **重整化 (renormalization)**: A physics term used philosophically. Must retain the technical precision while making the metaphorical extension clear. The author explicitly warns that renormalized phenomena are \"genuinely existent\" (切实存在) — this is a philosophical claim, not just a physics claim.\n    35→- **良定义 (well-defined)**: Mathematical jargon used philosophically. Keep as \"well-defined.\"\n    36→- **现象 (phenomenon)**: Used in a quasi-technical sense throughout. Must be consistent with how the later essays use it.\n    37→- **有效存在**: \"effective existence\" — a term borrowed from effective field theory. The author's neologism binds physics methodology to ontology.\n    38→- **Register**: The essay moves between colloquial Chinese, physics jargon, and philosophical argument. The tone is exploratory, almost thinking-aloud. Must preserve this informal-yet-rigorous quality.\n    39→- **Footnote 1** (\"只有立足自身，超越自身才有所定义\"): \"Only by standing on oneself does transcending oneself become definable.\" This is a dense philosophical claim compressed into classical-feeling Chinese. The word 立足 (stand on, be grounded in) and 超越 (transcend) need careful treatment.\n    40→- **Footnote 2**: Long and important — argues that even altruistic goals ultimately route through the individual's own interest-structure. This is not egoism but a structural claim about phenomenological access.\n    41→\n    42→**Performative structure:** The essay enacts the very move it describes — it begins from the individual's confusion, works outward to the collective, and then returns to the individual. The return is philosophically load-bearing.\n    43→\n    44→---\n    45→\n    46→### Essay 2: A Thought on Knowledge\n    47→**Already in English.** Author: Xueqi Li. Dated June 12, 2025.\n    48→\n    49→**Summary:** A systematic examination of \"knowledge as justified true belief\" (JTB) through the lens of actual epistemic practice. The author argues: (1) belief is intrinsically subjective and unconnected to objective truth; (2) our access is always to phenomena, not truth directly; (3) justification based on phenomena requires \"digestion\" into belief, so all justification is ultimately belief-based; (4) this leads to either circular justification or unjustified foundational beliefs; (5) in practice, knowledge is just \"what each individual believes to be correct.\"\n    50→\n    51→**Translation challenges:**\n    52→- This essay is already in English, so the main task is harmonization with the Chinese essays. How does 现象 in Essay 1 relate to \"phenomena\" here? They seem to be the same concept — the author's consistent use of 现象/phenomena across languages is a terminological anchor.\n    53→- The term \"digestion\" (converting phenomena into belief) is informal but philosophically precise. It likely corresponds to something in the Part 2 methodology.\n    54→- The sidenotes on physics (Standard Model, particle detection) and mathematics (proof as belief-chain) reinforce the same epistemological point as Essay 1's renormalization metaphor.\n    55→- The essay's conclusion — knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" — resonates strongly with Essay 1's claim that the individual can only start from and return to itself.\n    56→\n    57→**Performative structure:** The essay methodically walks through each component of JTB, not to refute it abstractly, but to show that *in practice* each component collapses into belief or phenomena. The Bob-and-rain examples are load-bearing — they demonstrate the digestion process.\n    58→\n    59→---\n    60→\n    61→### Essay 3: 西西弗斯、班与猫\n    62→**\"Sisyphus, Work, and Cats\"** (班 here means going to work/commuting, from 上班)\n    63→\n    64→**Summary:** The essay reinterprets Camus's absurdism. The author's core claim: absurdity arises only when one seeks meaning externally (from the universe). When meaning is internally generated, absurdity never arises. Three cases demonstrate this: (1) Sisyphus — canonical absurdist figure, but his \"revolt\" is itself an internal meaning; (2) the office worker — alienated labor creates absurdity because meaning is externalized; the same work done as one's own project (创业) dissolves absurdity; (3) cat ownership — involves repetitive, laborious, Sisyphean tasks (cleaning litter, dealing with fur), yet NO ONE who owns a cat ever feels absurd about it. The cat example is decisive: it shows that meaning does not require transcendence, rebellion, or even articulation — it is simply there, immanent in the activity itself.\n    65→\n    66→**Translation challenges:**\n    67→- **Title**: 班 is colloquial for work/commuting (from 上班). \"Sisyphus, Work, and Cats\" captures it, but loses the sonic/graphic parallel of the three monosyllables 西西弗斯、班、猫. Consider: \"Sisyphus, the Office, and the Cat.\"\n    68→- **荒谬 (absurdity)**: Standard Camus translation term. Must be consistent.\n    69→- **非和谐 (off-tone/disharmony)**: The author's own coinage (with English gloss \"off-tone\" in the original). This is a key concept — the felt discord between the self seeking meaning and the universe's silence.\n    70→- **异化 (alienation)**: Marxist resonance. The author ties absurdity to alienation — meaning externalized into labor.\n    71→- **超越 (transcendence)**: Used in scare quotes by the author. Gods and the universe are \"transcendent\" external existences. Internal meaning does not require transcendence.\n    72→- **内生 (endogenous/internally generated)**: Economics/biology term used philosophically. \"Endogenous meaning\" vs \"exogenous meaning\" could work, but may over-technicalize.\n    73→\n    74→**Performative structure:** The essay is brilliantly sequenced. It moves from the most dramatic (Sisyphus vs. the gods) through the everyday dramatic (office alienation) to the utterly mundane (cat ownership). Each step strips away a layer of grandeur. The final example is philosophically decisive precisely because it is so ordinary — no revolt, no transcendence, just a cat. The reader's own recognition (\"of course no one feels absurd about owning a cat\") is the philosophical payload. This sequencing MUST be preserved; it cannot be rearranged.\n    75→\n    76→---\n    77→\n    78→### Part 1 Cross-Cutting Observations\n    79→\n    80→1. **Individual as starting point**: All three essays begin from and return to the individual. Essay 1: the individual can only understand from its own standpoint. Essay 2: knowledge is what the individual believes. Essay 3: meaning is internally generated. This is a consistent phenomenological commitment.\n    81→\n    82→2. **现象/Phenomena**: A key term across essays. In Essay 1 it appears as emergent macroscopic phenomena. In Essay 2 it is what we have direct access to (as opposed to truth). These must be harmonized.\n    83→\n    84→3. **Physics metaphors as philosophical tools**: Renormalization (Essay 1), particle detection (Essay 2), effective field theory (Essay 1). These are not decorative — they carry philosophical weight. The author is a physicist by training.\n    85→\n    86→4. **Register**: Essays 1 and 3 are in Chinese with a thinking-aloud, exploratory register. Essay 2 is in English with a more formal, analytic-philosophy register. The collection deliberately includes both languages. Translation must decide: translate Essay 2 into Chinese? Or is the bilingual nature of the collection itself significant?\n    87→\n    88→5. **Progression**: Essay 1 (ontology of collective vs. individual) -> Essay 2 (epistemology: what can the individual know?) -> Essay 3 (existential: what about meaning?). The progression from ontology to epistemology to existential meaning is deliberate.\n    89→\n    90→---\n    91→\n    92→### Essay 4: 后形而上学 整理\n    93→**\"Post-Metaphysics: A Compilation\"**\n    94→\n    95→**Summary:** The methodological core of Part 2. The author develops a systematic framework: (1) Pre-metaphysics (前形而上学) = traditional metaphysics before nihilism; (2) Phenomena as First Reality (第一实在) — the indubitable starting point; (3) Four types of metaphysical construction (形而上), each involving recognition of repetition (恒常) then fixation into concept; (4) The Laozi example showing how 道-德-仁-义-礼 is generated in reverse from how it is understood; (5) Non-rationality (非理性) as the acknowledged ground of rational activity; (6) Post-metaphysics: grounded in phenomena, core practice = overlap of ideal and phenomena = practice = self-realization.\n    96→\n    97→**Translation challenges:**\n    98→- **前/后形而上学**: Author's coinages.

Two modes: 沉醉的 (intoxicated — faith, meaning as unquestioned first principle) and 清醒的 (lucid — knowing engagement, = 诗意/the poetic). We cannot reject all dreamscapes because we are constituted by feeling. After disenchantment, the only path is lucid engagement: poiesis.\n   113→\n   114→**Translation challenges:**\n   115→- **诗意**: THE central challenge. Not \"poetic\" or \"poetry.\" A mode of being: lucid, knowing engagement with meaning-structures. Options: \"the poetic,\" \"poiesis,\" \"poetic dwelling.\" Must consult experts.\n   116→- **梦境**: \"Dreamscape\" — spatial/environmental quality.\n   117→- **沉醉/清醒**: \"Intoxicated/Lucid.\"\n   118→- **虚妄**: Author's personal coinage (empty + presumptuous).\n   119→- **感受 and 意义 as 两面一体**: Feeling and meaning as two sides of one body.\n   120→\n   121→---\n   122→\n   123→### Essay 6: 范畴论与境 整理\n   124→**\"Category Theory and Jing: A Compilation\"**\n   125→\n   126→**Summary:** The formal mathematical backbone.

Human condition as non-tragic (constraints enable creation). Coin-flipping as poiesis. Death as transcendent to self. Category theory as one tool among many — poetry, art, memes, desk arrangement all construct jing. We are already poets of our own experience. Two questions: How is philosophy possible?

Translation must serve all registers.\n   175→\n   176→6. **Working draft quality**: Todo sections and self-corrections must be preserved — part of philosophical honesty.\n   177→\n   178→---\n   179→\n   180→## Expert Report Notes\n   181→\n   182→### Metaphysics Expert — Key Translation Insights\n   183→\n   184→1. **境 (jing)**: Expert suggests \"Sphere\" or transliterated \"Jing\" with glossary entry. Also considers \"experiential sphere.\" Advises against \"world\" (too broad) or \"state\" (too static).\n   185→2. **形而上 vs. 形而上学**: \"the metaphysical\" vs. \"metaphysics\" — distinction is load-bearing. Both must be rendered distinctly.\n   186→3. **第一/第二/第〇实在**: \"First Reality\" / \"Second Reality\" / \"Zeroth Reality\" — numbering preserved. Footnote clarifying that \"First\" is epistemic, not ontological, is essential.\n   187→4. **恒常**: \"Constancy\" — not \"permanence\" (too strong), not \"regularity\" (too weak), not \"invariance\" (too technical).\n   188→5. **非理性**: \"The non-rational\" — NOT \"irrational.\" Outside reason, not against it.\n   189→6. **现象**: \"Phenomena\" — but closer to phenomenological tradition (Husserl) than to Kant. Not \"mere appearances.\"\n   190→7. **诗意**: \"The poetic\" or \"poiesis.\" NOT poetry in literary sense. Lucid, self-aware engagement with meaning.\n   191→8. **梦境**: \"Dreamscape\" — immersive, constructed quality.\n   192→9. **沉醉/清醒**: \"Intoxicated\" / \"Lucid\" — lucid dreaming metaphor is apt.\n   193→10. **祛魅**: \"Disenchantment\" — maps to Weber's Entzauberung.\n   194→11. **联想**: \"Association\" — morphisms in E. Hume's association of ideas precedent, but upgraded via category theory.\n   195→12. **The 3-reality schema parallels**: Kantian noumenon (第〇), Husserlian Lebenswelt (第一), Carnapian frameworks (第二).\n   196→13. **Essays function as philosophical experiments** — experiential sequences are load-bearing, not merely illustrative. Must prioritize experiential rhythm over literal accuracy where they conflict.\n   197→\n   198→### Phenomenology Expert — Key Translation Insights\n   199→\n   200→1. **P as Lebenswelt**: The totality of phenomena functions like Husserl's pre-theoretical lifeworld. P is the \"phenomenological field\" given formal character.\n   201→2. **Tower structure = infinite iterability of reflection**: Morphisms becoming objects mirrors phenomenological insight that acts of consciousness can become objects of new acts recursively.\n   202→3. **Universal properties = eidetic constitution**: The concept of \"pen\" as terminal object in a subcategory formalizes Husserl's eidetic constitution — how essences are constituted through synthesis of particulars.\n   203→4. **Ship of Theseus = noematic nucleus**: The feeling that serves as universal property linking associated experiences is precisely Husserl's noematic Kern.\n   204→5. **感受 (ganshou)**: \"Feeling\" or \"felt experience\" — carries weight of both Husserl's Empfindung and Michel Henry's affection. NOT mere \"sensation.\"\n   205→6. **体验 (tiyan)**: \"Lived experience\" — Chinese equivalent of Erlebnis.\n   206→7. **E-notation**: Author's own E = Enclosed/Emotion/Experience. Expert suggests \"Enclosure\" as possible rendering but notes it loses Chinese resonances.\n   207→8. **Introspection as phenomenological method**: Using structural relations as a \"map\" to navigate experience = close to Husserl's free variation.\n   208→9. **eta = fulfilled intention (erfullte Intention)**: When eta is identity, meaning-intention is perfectly filled by the given object.\n   209→10. **Intersubjectivity via eta**: Sidesteps qualia problem entirely. Two people share understanding when structural alignment has the same form. Improves on Husserl's appresentation.\n   210→11. **Bootstrapping problem remains**: How do two E-structures become coordinated through interaction? This is the residual question.\n   211→\n   212→### Epistemology Expert — Key Translation Insights\n   213→\n   214→1. **知识 (zhishi)**: \"Knowledge\" — but author's analysis shows it is closer to \"what is believed to be correct.\"\n   215→2. **信念 (xinnian)**: \"Belief\" — Chinese carries stronger conviction connotations than English technical usage.\n   216→3. **证实关系 (zhengshi guanxi)**: \"Justification relation\" or \"verification relation\" — 证实 means both justify and verify. In K1, these are morphisms in the knowledge category.\n   217→4. **知识的发生 (zhishi de fasheng)**: \"The genesis of knowledge\" or \"the occurrence of knowledge\" — event-like, dynamic. Neither \"knowledge formation\" nor \"knowledge emergence\" is perfect.\n   218→5. **稳定结构 (wending jiegou)**: \"Stable structure\" — author's replacement for \"a priori categories.\" Keep mathematical character.\n   219→6. **Access argument**: The shift from \"what justification bases are\" to \"how we access them\" is the essay's most important move. \"Methodological phenomenalism\" applied to epistemology.\n   220→7. **Bob examples are load-bearing**: Three Bobs must appear in exact sequence with specific details (sprinkler, emotional absorption). They are a philosophical experiment.\n   221→8. **Meno paradox resolution**: Structural-gap account — we know what we seek by the shape of what is missing. Original and precise.\n   222→9. **JTB dissolution**: Author doesn't add a 4th condition (post-Gettier) or reject one — shows truth and justification both reduce to belief in practice. More radical than most contemporary positions.\n   223→\n   224→### Existentialism Expert — Key Translation Insights\n   225→\n   226→1. **荒谬 (huangmiu)**: \"Absurdity\" — but Chinese term carries stronger \"ridiculousness\" connotation than French absurde. This actually serves the argument: the absurd IS ridiculous because it's a misdirected search.\n   227→2. **虚无 (xuwu)**: \"The void\" (substantive) / \"nihilism\" (虚无主义). Chinese term has Daoist cosmological resonance (productive void) absent from Nietzsche's Nihilismus. Translator's note needed.\n   228→3. **诗意**: Expert recommends \"the poetic\" with \"poetic dwelling\" in habitative contexts. Needs translator's essay explaining it functions like Heidegger's Dichtung — world-disclosing activity, not versification.\n   229→4. **超越/超越性**: \"Transcendence\" — but used in 3 senses: (a) beyond self, (b) beyond phenomena, (c) outward-reaching quality of goals. Annotation needed.\n   230→5. **Author's 诗意 vs. Western alternatives**: More livable than Nietzsche's amor fati (too ecstatic), Camus's revolt (too heroic), Heidegger's Gelassenheit (too quietist). It is active but not heroic, aware but not detached.\n   231→6. **Cat example**: Will likely become a memorable philosophical example in its own right. The mundane is philosophically decisive precisely because it is ordinary.\n   232→7. **Death critique**: Author's objection to Heidegger's Sein-zum-Tode — death we \"live toward\" is always our conception of death shaped by our framework, not death itself.\n   233→8. **Coin-flip as 诗意**: Compact example of lucid engagement — you must genuinely invest in the constructed 境 for it to work.\n   234→\n   235→### Philosophy of Mind Expert — Key Translation Insights\n   236→\n   237→1. **E as cognitive architecture**: Category theory captures composability and hierarchy of mental operations, not just static structure. Morphism composition = coherent chains of association.\n   238→2. **Arrows-only metacategory**: No fundamental distinction between \"a concept\" and \"an association between concepts.\" Resonates with William James's radical empiricism.\n   239→3. **Tower structure = meta-cognition**: T_1 = thinking about thinking. Flattening property = meta-cognitive levels coexist in unified field (matching phenomenological observation).\n   240→4. **Meta-order is non-intrinsic**: Dragon blood example — which level of abstraction something is at depends on cognitive history. No direct analogue in standard Higher-Order Thought theories.\n   241→5. **S_E as a priori cognitive structures**: Parallels Kant's categories, Chomsky's Universal Grammar, Spelke's core knowledge. Framework contribution: characterizes these as structural invariants under categorical evolution.\n   242→6. **Basket metaphor (篮子)**: Captures cognitive closure (McGinn) — what hasn't entered P is unavailable for processing. Transforms metaphysical limit into empirical research program.\n   243→7. **eta as \"feeling of knowing\"**: Formally precise phenomenological characterization of understanding. When eta is identity = \"mastery\" (掌握). Naturality condition = \"transfer\" in education.\n   244→8. **联想 (lianxiang)**: \"Association\" — but richer. Classical associationism (Hume) upgraded with composability and identity. Closer to \"cognitive morphism.\"\n   245→9. **Universal properties as \"the feeling of a concept\"**: Not a definition or prototype but a quale — the characteristic feeling of pen-ness functioning as terminal object.\n   246→10. **Intersubjectivity**: Subsumes Zahavi's empathy, Gallese's shared manifold, Brandom's inferentialism as special cases.\n   247→\n   248→### Kantian Expert — Key Translation Insights\n   249→\n   250→1. **Author's 第一实在 is pre-categorical**: Closer to Kant's \"manifold of intuition\" before synthesis, or even sensory \"matter\" of appearance, than to Kantian Erscheinung (always already constituted). More Husserlian than Kantian.\n   251→2. **S_E parallels Kantian categories**: But author leaves S_E unspecified (to be discovered empirically), unlike Kant who deduces from table of judgments. Author's approach is more neo-Kantian.\n   252→3. **\"Another kind of Kantian question\"**: Author explicitly frames \"How is meaning possible?\" as parallel to \"How is synthetic a priori knowledge possible?\" — extending Kantian architecture to meaning/value.\n   253→4. **Category theory vs. table of categories**: Universal properties replace Kantian categories, functors replace schematism, natural transformations replace synthetic unity of apperception. Genuine formalization of what Kant gestured at.\n   254→5. **Dynamic vs. static**: Author introduces evolution functor T, making experience fundamentally dynamic. Kant's framework is static — categories don't change.\n   255→6. **eta addresses Kant's intersubjectivity gap**: Kant assumes all rational beings share same cognitive architecture but never proves it. Author's eta provides a structural, testable criterion.\n   256→7. **Non-rationality divergence**: Kant would never call the drive for metaphysics \"non-rational\" — for him, reason's demand for the unconditioned IS rational.\n   257→8. **形而上 reinterpretation**: Author reads 形 in 形而上者谓之道 as 现象 (phenomena), not the traditional \"visible form.\" This is a significant hermeneutical move that should be noted.\n   258→\n   259→### Chinese Philosophy Expert — Key Translation Insights\n   260→\n   261→1. **道德仁义礼 reversal**: No Chinese philosopher has explicitly argued the entire hierarchy is a phenomenological construction built bottom-up. Closest precedent is Xunzi's empiricism about 礼, but Xunzi never extended to 道 itself.\n   262→2. **德 (de)**: \"Inherent character\" or retain \"De.\" NOT \"virtue\" (imports moral connotations author strips away). NOT \"essence\" (imports Western metaphysical baggage being deconstructed). Author's constructivist spin: 德 is assembled from inductively generalized properties then normatively imposed as definitional.\n   263→3. **仁 (ren)**: \"Humaneness\" or \"fellow-feeling\" — author emphasizes inner feeling first, behavioral expression second.\n   264→4. **义 (yi)**: \"Moral impetus\" or \"sense of obligation\" — author emphasizes motivational bridge quality.\n   265→5. **礼 (li)**: \"Ritual conduct\" or \"patterned behavior\" at phenomenal level. NOT religious ceremony.\n   266→6. **境 as Chinese concept**: Author preserves core Buddhist insight that 境 is structured by mind, not \"the world out there.\" But transforms: formalized via category theory, given dynamic evolution. Closest traditional resonance is 境界 in its most general sense.\n   267→7. **诗意 as synthesis**: Chinese aesthetic tradition (意境) + Buddhist awareness (觉/悟) + Western post-nihilist existentialism. Rooted in Chinese sensibility but not confined by it.\n   268→8. **恒常 vs. Daoist 常 vs. Buddhist 无常**: Author's 恒常 is epistemological/pragmatic — what we seek in phenomena. Not ontological like Daoist 常 (eternal pattern) or Buddhist 无常 (no permanence).\n   269→9. **虚无 vs. Buddhist 空**: Completely different. Author's 虚无 = absence of transcendent ground. Buddhist 空 = dependent origination. Must NOT be conflated.\n   270→10. **Essays as experiments**: Parallels classical Chinese method — Mencius's 孺子入井, Zhuangzi's parables. The form IS the method. Translation must preserve experiential arc.\n   271→11. **Double burden of every key term**: Traditional resonance + author's reinterpretation. Translator must preserve both.\n   272→\n   273→### Buddhism Expert — Key Translation Insights\n   274→\n   275→1. **境 and Yogacara visaya**: Author preserves insight that 境 is domain as structured by mind, not \"world out there.\" But enriches: formalizes relations between object-takings, not just object-takings themselves.\n   276→2. **Tower structure resonates with Hua-yen (华严)**: Indra's net — mutual reflection, tower-like structure. Fa-zang's metaphor is the single best Buddhist image for what the tower construction formalizes.\n   277→3. **Post-metaphysics = Middle Way**: Pre-metaphysics (eternalism/常见) -> nihilism (断见) -> post-metaphysics (middle way). Remarkably precise structural parallel.\n   278→4. **清醒的梦境 parallels Chan awakening**: \"Mountains are mountains again\" — third stage. Full engagement with full awareness. Diamond Sutra: \"contemplate them thus while continuing practice.\"\n   279→5. **Self as universal property = anatman**: \"I\" as terminal object in subcategory, not substance = Middle Way on self. Neither eternalism nor nihilism.\n   280→6. **恒常 = first cognitive inversion (viparyasa)**: Taking impermanent as permanent. Author's analysis parallels Buddhist diagnosis precisely.\n   281→7. **Critical difference from Buddhism**: Author proposes \"post-metaphysical constancy-seeking\" (recognize and work with it lucidly) rather than \"cessation of constancy-seeking\" (overcome through insight).\n   282→8. **清醒 carries overtones of 觉 (bodhi)**: \"Lucid\" best preserves both clear-seeing and dreamscape context. Avoid \"awakened\" (too Buddhist) and \"conscious\" (too Cartesian).\n   283→9. **Author's 虚无 is NOT sunyata**: Kumarajiva rendered sunyata as 空 precisely to avoid confusion with 無. Author follows this distinction implicitly. Must be noted.\n   284→10. **Philosophical experiments = upaya (skillful means)**: Buddhist pedagogical tradition treats teachings as devices for producing experiential transformations. Koans are the purest example.\n   285→\n   286→### Wittgenstein Expert — Key Translation Insights\n   287→\n   288→1. **Language games reoriented**: Author treats language games as probes (methodological instruments), not as bedrock (Wittgenstein's use). Closer to Brandom's appropriation — taking primacy of practice and embedding in systematic project.\n   289→2. **Structure/meaning resolution via natural transformation**: Neither generates the other; they must be aligned. Formalizes Wittgenstein's meaning-as-use insight that meaning and use are co-constitutive.\n   290→3. **Natural transformation subsumes both picture theory AND meaning-as-use**: Picture theory as special case (eta = isomorphism); later Wittgenstein as general case (eta = experiential alignment).\n   291→4. **Philosophical therapy explained structurally**: Tension (张力) = subcategory lacking well-defined universal property. Therapy = restructuring category to resolve tension. Wittgenstein would resist the explanation but the account provides positive criterion for when puzzlement arises.\n   292→5. **理解 vs. 掌握**: \"Understanding\" vs. \"mastery/direct grasp.\" 掌握 = eta is identity morphism = no mediation. Important distinction for translation.\n   293→6. **Private language argument compatibility**: Author's structural position criterion IS the public criterion Wittgenstein argues sensation-terms must have. Beetle-in-the-box: private content drops out; structural role remains.\n   294→7. **On Certainty parallels**: Author's analysis and OC arrive at similar conclusions. But author dissolves knowledge/belief distinction entirely (more pragmatist); Wittgenstein preserves the grammar via hinge propositions.\n   295→8. **Forms of life vs. 境**: Parallel but not identical. Forms of life are communal background; 境 is individual structural medium. Different starting points, overlapping territory.\n   296→9. **Kripkenstein problem addressed**: Naturality condition constrains eta globally, not just at finitely many points — no room for quaddition-like deviance.\n   297→10. **Essays as experiments**: Most Wittgensteinian aspect — philosophy as activity, not doctrine. Medium is the message.\n   298→\n   299→---\n   300→\n   301→### Cross-Expert Consensus on Translation\n   302→\n   303→All 9 experts converge on several critical points:\n   304→\n   305→1. **境 should be transliterated as \"Jing\"** (or left as E in technical passages), with extensive translator's note. No single English word works.\n   306→\n   307→2. **Experiential sequences are load-bearing**: The Sisyphus/cat progression, the 道德仁义礼 reversal, the Bob examples, the 1+1=2 passage — all function as philosophical experiments on the reader. Reordering, summarizing, or abstracting them destroys the philosophical content. ALL experts flag this independently.\n   308→\n   309→3. **诗意 = \"the Poetic\"** (capitalized as philosophical stance, like \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\"). Needs translator's essay. Not poetry, not aesthetics — an existential stance.\n   310→\n   311→4. **恒常 = \"Constancy\"**: Universal agreement across experts.\n   312→\n   313→5. **非理性 = \"the non-rational\"**: Universal agreement. NOT \"irrational.\"\n   314→\n   315→6. **形而上 vs. 形而上学**: Must be rendered distinctly. \"The metaphysical\" vs. \"metaphysics.\"\n   316→\n   317→7. **The eta/natural transformation accounts for intersubjectivity**: Multiple experts (metaphysics, phenomenology, epistemology, existentialism, phil-mind, Kantian, Chinese phil, Buddhism, Wittgenstein) independently identify this as the framework's most significant innovation. Translation should make this connection visible.\n   318→\n   319→8. **Author arrives independently at positions convergent with multiple Western traditions**: Husserl (phenomenological reduction), Heidegger (critique of metaphysics, poetic dwelling), Wittgenstein (private language, meaning-as-use), Nagarjuna (emptiness, middle way), Kant (transcendental conditions). Translation must make resonances visible without reducing author's independent achievement to \"influence.\"\n   320→\n   321→---\n   322→\n   323→## Overall Translation Approach\n   324→\n   325→### 1.

On first occurrence in each essay, it receives an inline gloss: \"Jing (境, the structured experiential field).\" The formal symbol **E** is used in technical/mathematical passages (as the author does).

The translation must preserve these shifts:\n   393→\n   394→1. **Colloquial/thinking-aloud** (Essays 1, 3, parts of 8): Informal, exploratory, sometimes humorous. Use natural conversational English. Preserve run-on thoughts, self-corrections, parenthetical asides.\n   395→\n   396→2. **Analytic philosophy** (Essay 2, parts of 4): Precise, argumentative, uses technical terms (JTB, justification, phenomena). Already in English for Essay 2 — use as the register standard.\n   397→\n   398→3. **Classical Chinese quotation** (Laozi, Mengzi, Yijing in Essays 4, 8): Romanize and gloss. Provide standard English translations of classical passages, with notes on how the author departs from standard readings.\n   399→\n   400→4. **Mathematical/formal** (Essays 6, 7): Standard mathematical English. Preserve all notation. Category theory terms use established English conventions (functor, morphism, natural transformation, universal property, etc.).\n   401→\n   402→5. **Near-lyrical/poetic** (Essay 5 climax, Essay 8 conclusion): Rare in this collection, which makes these moments load-bearing.

Follow with **glossed English translation** — key terms glossed on first occurrence as \"English (漢字, pinyin)\", e.g., \"humaneness (仁, ren)\"\n   410→3. After first introduction, use **plain English only** — e.g., just \"humaneness\"\n   411→4. **现象X compounds** (现象仁, 现象礼, 现象义) keep the \"phenomenal\" prefix **always** — never drop it. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (author's coinage for lived experience) is load-bearing for the argument.\n   412→\n   413→**Refinements:**\n   414→- Re-gloss briefly at **register transitions** — when the same term (e.g., 仁) shifts from classical quotation to the author's modern analysis, add a brief \"(仁)\" reminder\n   415→- Only gloss **philosophically load-bearing terms**, not every content word\n   416→- For the author's coined compounds (现象仁 etc.), no romanization needed after first gloss — \"phenomenal humaneness\" is self-explanatory\n   417→- Make the 文言/modern Chinese boundary visible through **formatting** (block-indent for classical quotations vs. running text for the author's analysis)\n   418→\n   419→*Unanimously endorsed by all 9 experts.*\n   420→\n   421→### 5. Structural Principles\n   422→\n   423→1. **Preserve experiential sequences exactly**. Every expert independently flagged this. The Sisyphus-to-cat progression, the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li reversal, the three Bobs, the 1+1=2 passage — these are philosophical experiments. Do not reorder, summarize, or abstract.\n   424→\n   425→2. **Preserve working-draft quality**. Todo sections, self-corrections, incomplete passages, and authorial hedges (\"I think,\" \"perhaps\") are part of the philosophical honesty of the collection. Do not polish them away.\n   426→\n   427→3. **Preserve the bilingual nature**. Essay 2 is in English. The collection is deliberately bilingual. The Chinese-to-English translation encompasses 7 essays + table of contents. Essay 2 stays as-is (with minor harmonization of terminology if needed).\n   428→\n   429→4. **Preserve the fish/fishing structure**. Part 1 (上集：鱼) and Part 2 (下集：渔) must retain the structural metaphor. Translate as \"Upper Collection: Fish\" and \"Lower Collection: Fishing\" (or similar), with a translator's note on the proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔.\n   430→\n   431→5. **Footnotes and sidenotes**: Author's footnotes are often philosophically essential (e.g., Essay 1 footnote 2, Essay 4 footnote 25). Translate all footnotes. Add translator's notes sparingly — only where (a) a Chinese cultural reference would be opaque to English readers, (b) a Western philosophical parallel would help, or (c) the internet meme requires explanation.\n   432→\n   433→### 6. Translator's Apparatus (Planned)\n   434→\n   435→1. **Translator's Introduction**: Short essay explaining the title (Jing Ji), the author's intellectual profile (physicist-philosopher), the bilingual nature, the fish/fishing structure, and the experimental/performative dimension of the essays. Alert readers that experiential sequences are load-bearing.\n   436→\n   437→2. **Glossary**: Full glossary of key terms with romanization, Chinese characters, and explanations.\n   438→\n   439→3. **Translator's Notes**: Inline footnotes marked [TN] to distinguish from author's notes.\n   440→\n   441→### 7.

Experts: existentialism + phenomenology, both endorse.\n   469→- **Q2: 境集 = \"Jing Ji\"** (RESOLVED). Pure romanization, no subtitle (or \"Essays on Jing\" if publisher requires). Translator's introduction explains 境. Expert: Chinese philosophy.\n   470→- **Q3: Essay 2 untouched + minimal apparatus** (RESOLVED). Do not edit author's English. Add prefatory note (3-4 sentences) + 3 translator's footnotes connecting \"digestion,\" \"what each individual believes,\" and \"standard\" to formal counterparts. Preserve register difference as feature. Expert: epistemology.\n   471→- **Q4: 梦境 = \"dreamscape\"** (RESOLVED). Preserves Diamond Sutra dream-simile, \"-scape\" signals constructed environment, avoids \"realm\" cosmological baggage. Surreal connotation contextually controlled. Expert: Buddhism.\n   472→- **Q5: Meme sentence = English meme replacement + translator's note** (RESOLVED). Replace with English grammatically-plausible-but-semantically-void sentence. Literal translation would produce \"bad translation\" experience, not \"natively incomprehensible\" experience — different structural positions. Note cites original Chinese. Expert: Wittgenstein.\n   473→- **Q6: 虚妄 = \"vain presumption\"** (RESOLVED). NOT Buddhist 虚妄 (mṛṣā). \"Vain\" = empty + conceited (mirrors Chinese double meaning). \"Presumption\" = claiming impossible standpoint. Footnote disambiguates from Buddhist usage. Expert: Buddhism.\n   474→- **Q7: 形 = 现象 note = Introduction paragraph + footnote** (RESOLVED). Half-page in Translator's Introduction explaining Xici zhuan source and author's departure. Footnote at first occurrence of the quotation in Essay 4. Western readers would not notice the reinterpretation without a note, flattening the author's originality.

Key structural observations:\n\n- **Two-part structure plus appendix:**\n  - Part 1: 上集：鱼 (Upper Collection: Fish) — 3 essays, informal/essayistic, each can be read independently\n  - Part 2: 下集：渔 (Lower Collection: Fishing) — 4 essays, more systematic/methodological, strongly interlinked, described as working drafts\n  - Appendix: 1 essay of scattered thoughts\n\n- **鱼/渔 (Fish/Fishing) metaphor**: This is a deliberate allusion to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔 (\"give a man a fish vs. teach him to fish\"). Part 1 gives concrete philosophical reflections (the fish); Part 2 reveals the methodology behind them (the fishing). This structural metaphor is load-bearing and must be preserved in translation.\n\n- **Reading order is prescribed**: The author notes that the essays were written at different times and are NOT arranged chronologically, but the given order is recommended. This confirms that sequencing is philosophically intentional.\n\n- **Part 2 caveat**: The author warns that concepts and terminology differ from established philosophical traditions — \"需要注意甄别以免混淆\" (one must carefully distinguish to avoid confusion). This is a critical signal for translation: standard philosophical glosses may mislead.\n\n- **Title 境集**: 境 (jing) is a term with enormous range — boundary, realm, situation, state, environment, condition (Buddhist: visaya/gocara). The title itself is a translation challenge. Provisional: leave as romanized \"Jing Ji\" with a translator's note, or find an English rendering after full reading.\n\n---\n\n## Essay Reading Notes\n\n### Essay 1: 关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一\n**\"A Brief Thought on Collective Interest, Part One\"**\n\n**Summary:** The essay examines whether \"collective interest\" (集体利益) genuinely exists or is merely an aggregate of individual interests. The author resolves this by analogy to renormalization (重整化) in physics: just as macroscopic phenomena (ocean waves) emerge from microscopic dynamics (water molecules), collective interest is a well-defined (良定义) emergent phenomenon at a different scale. The essay then argues that individuals can only understand others from their own individual standpoint — this is what makes empathy possible. Laws function like temperature: they act on microscopic individuals but have macroscopic (collective) effects.\n\n**Translation challenges:**\n- **重整化 (renormalization)**: A physics term used philosophically. Must retain the technical precision while making the metaphorical extension clear. The author explicitly warns that renormalized phenomena are \"genuinely existent\" (切实存在) — this is a philosophical claim, not just a physics claim.\n- **良定义 (well-defined)**: Mathematical jargon used philosophically. Keep as \"well-defined.\"\n- **现象 (phenomenon)**: Used in a quasi-technical sense throughout. Must be consistent with how the later essays use it.\n- **有效存在**: \"effective existence\" — a term borrowed from effective field theory. The author's neologism binds physics methodology to ontology.\n- **Register**: The essay moves between colloquial Chinese, physics jargon, and philosophical argument. The tone is exploratory, almost thinking-aloud. Must preserve this informal-yet-rigorous quality.\n- **Footnote 1** (\"只有立足自身，超越自身才有所定义\"): \"Only by standing on oneself does transcending oneself become definable.\" This is a dense philosophical claim compressed into classical-feeling Chinese. The word 立足 (stand on, be grounded in) and 超越 (transcend) need careful treatment.\n- **Footnote 2**: Long and important — argues that even altruistic goals ultimately route through the individual's own interest-structure. This is not egoism but a structural claim about phenomenological access.\n\n**Performative structure:** The essay enacts the very move it describes — it begins from the individual's confusion, works outward to the collective, and then returns to the individual. The return is philosophically load-bearing.\n\n---\n\n### Essay 2: A Thought on Knowledge\n**Already in English.** Author: Xueqi Li. Dated June 12, 2025.\n\n**Summary:** A systematic examination of \"knowledge as justified true belief\" (JTB) through the lens of actual epistemic practice. The author argues: (1) belief is intrinsically subjective and unconnected to objective truth; (2) our access is always to phenomena, not truth directly; (3) justification based on phenomena requires \"digestion\" into belief, so all justification is ultimately belief-based; (4) this leads to either circular justification or unjustified foundational beliefs; (5) in practice, knowledge is just \"what each individual believes to be correct.\"\n\n**Translation challenges:**\n- This essay is already in English, so the main task is harmonization with the Chinese essays. How does 现象 in Essay 1 relate to \"phenomena\" here? They seem to be the same concept — the author's consistent use of 现象/phenomena across languages is a terminological anchor.\n- The term \"digestion\" (converting phenomena into belief) is informal but philosophically precise. It likely corresponds to something in the Part 2 methodology.\n- The sidenotes on physics (Standard Model, particle detection) and mathematics (proof as belief-chain) reinforce the same epistemological point as Essay 1's renormalization metaphor.\n- The essay's conclusion — knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" — resonates strongly with Essay 1's claim that the individual can only start from and return to itself.\n\n**Performative structure:** The essay methodically walks through each component of JTB, not to refute it abstractly, but to show that *in practice* each component collapses into belief or phenomena. The Bob-and-rain examples are load-bearing — they demonstrate the digestion process.\n\n---\n\n### Essay 3: 西西弗斯、班与猫\n**\"Sisyphus, Work, and Cats\"** (班 here means going to work/commuting, from 上班)\n\n**Summary:** The essay reinterprets Camus's absurdism. The author's core claim: absurdity arises only when one seeks meaning externally (from the universe). When meaning is internally generated, absurdity never arises. Three cases demonstrate this: (1) Sisyphus — canonical absurdist figure, but his \"revolt\" is itself an internal meaning; (2) the office worker — alienated labor creates absurdity because meaning is externalized; the same work done as one's own project (创业) dissolves absurdity; (3) cat ownership — involves repetitive, laborious, Sisyphean tasks (cleaning litter, dealing with fur), yet NO ONE who owns a cat ever feels absurd about it. The cat example is decisive: it shows that meaning does not require transcendence, rebellion, or even articulation — it is simply there, immanent in the activity itself.\n\n**Translation challenges:**\n- **Title**: 班 is colloquial for work/commuting (from 上班). \"Sisyphus, Work, and Cats\" captures it, but loses the sonic/graphic parallel of the three monosyllables 西西弗斯、班、猫. Consider: \"Sisyphus, the Office, and the Cat.\"\n- **荒谬 (absurdity)**: Standard Camus translation term. Must be consistent.\n- **非和谐 (off-tone/disharmony)**: The author's own coinage (with English gloss \"off-tone\" in the original). This is a key concept — the felt discord between the self seeking meaning and the universe's silence.\n- **异化 (alienation)**: Marxist resonance. The author ties absurdity to alienation — meaning externalized into labor.\n- **超越 (transcendence)**: Used in scare quotes by the author. Gods and the universe are \"transcendent\" external existences. Internal meaning does not require transcendence.\n- **内生 (endogenous/internally generated)**: Economics/biology term used philosophically. \"Endogenous meaning\" vs \"exogenous meaning\" could work, but may over-technicalize.\n\n**Performative structure:** The essay is brilliantly sequenced. It moves from the most dramatic (Sisyphus vs. the gods) through the everyday dramatic (office alienation) to the utterly mundane (cat ownership). Each step strips away a layer of grandeur. The final example is philosophically decisive precisely because it is so ordinary — no revolt, no transcendence, just a cat. The reader's own recognition (\"of course no one feels absurd about owning a cat\") is the philosophical payload. This sequencing MUST be preserved; it cannot be rearranged.\n\n---\n\n### Part 1 Cross-Cutting Observations\n\n1. **Individual as starting point**: All three essays begin from and return to the individual. Essay 1: the individual can only understand from its own standpoint. Essay 2: knowledge is what the individual believes. Essay 3: meaning is internally generated. This is a consistent phenomenological commitment.\n\n2. **现象/Phenomena**: A key term across essays. In Essay 1 it appears as emergent macroscopic phenomena. In Essay 2 it is what we have direct access to (as opposed to truth). These must be harmonized.\n\n3. **Physics metaphors as philosophical tools**: Renormalization (Essay 1), particle detection (Essay 2), effective field theory (Essay 1). These are not decorative — they carry philosophical weight. The author is a physicist by training.\n\n4. **Register**: Essays 1 and 3 are in Chinese with a thinking-aloud, exploratory register. Essay 2 is in English with a more formal, analytic-philosophy register. The collection deliberately includes both languages. Translation must decide: translate Essay 2 into Chinese? Or is the bilingual nature of the collection itself significant?\n\n5. **Progression**: Essay 1 (ontology of collective vs. individual) -> Essay 2 (epistemology: what can the individual know?) -> Essay 3 (existential: what about meaning?). The progression from ontology to epistemology to existential meaning is deliberate.\n\n---\n\n### Essay 4: 后形而上学 整理\n**\"Post-Metaphysics: A Compilation\"**\n\n**Summary:** The methodological core of Part 2. The author develops a systematic framework: (1) Pre-metaphysics (前形而上学) = traditional metaphysics before nihilism; (2) Phenomena as First Reality (第一实在) — the indubitable starting point; (3) Four types of metaphysical construction (形而上), each involving recognition of repetition (恒常) then fixation into concept; (4) The Laozi example showing how 道-德-仁-义-礼 is generated in reverse from how it is understood; (5) Non-rationality (非理性) as the acknowledged ground of rational activity; (6) Post-metaphysics: grounded in phenomena, core practice = overlap of ideal and phenomena = practice = self-realization.\n\n**Translation challenges:**\n- **前/后形而上学**: Author's coinages. Must NOT be confused with Habermas's \"post-metaphysical.\"\n- **第一实在/第二实在/第〇实在**: Numbered reality levels (First/Second/Zeroth Reality). Author's own system.\n- **恒常**: \"Constancy\" — the fundamental drive behind all metaphysical construction.\n- **The Laozi passage**: Romanize (Dao, De, Ren, Yi, Li) with glosses. 现象礼/现象仁/现象义 = \"phenomenal-Li/Ren/Yi\" (neologisms).\n- **非理性**: \"Non-rational\" (not \"irrational\").\n- **形而上 vs. 形而上学**: \"The metaphysical\" vs. \"metaphysics\" — distinction is load-bearing.\n\n**Performative structure:** Constructs a framework, shows how the framework is constructed from phenomena, acknowledges the non-rationality of that constructive activity.\n\n---\n\n### Essay 5: 形而上学后的目的：诗意\n**\"The Purpose After Metaphysics: The Poetic\"**\n\n**Summary:** Introduces 梦境 (dreamscape) as the environment in which meaning exists. Two modes: 沉醉的 (intoxicated — faith, meaning as unquestioned first principle) and 清醒的 (lucid — knowing engagement, = 诗意/the poetic). We cannot reject all dreamscapes because we are constituted by feeling. After disenchantment, the only path is lucid engagement: poiesis.\n\n**Translation challenges:**\n- **诗意**: THE central challenge. Not \"poetic\" or \"poetry.\" A mode of being: lucid, knowing engagement with meaning-structures. Options: \"the poetic,\" \"poiesis,\" \"poetic dwelling.\" Must consult experts.\n- **梦境**: \"Dreamscape\" — spatial/environmental quality.\n- **沉醉/清醒**: \"Intoxicated/Lucid.\"\n- **虚妄**: Author's personal coinage (empty + presumptuous).\n- **感受 and 意义 as 两面一体**: Feeling and meaning as two sides of one body.\n\n---\n\n### Essay 6: 范畴论与境 整理\n**\"Category Theory and Jing: A Compilation\"**\n\n**Summary:** The formal mathematical backbone. Uses category theory to model thought/experience structure. P (frak P) = totality of phenomena. E (bb E) = categorical structure ON P (= jing). Objects = experiences, morphisms = associations (also experiences). Tower structure = self-referential hierarchy. 形而上 = universal property in a sub-jing. Ship of Theseus resolved. Construction = meta-order assignment = metaphysics.\n\n**Translation challenges:**\n- **境 (Jing)**: MUST be transliterated. No single English word captures boundary + realm + state + experience-structure.\n- **联想 (association)**: Morphisms in E = experiential links.\n- **塔式结构 (tower structure)**: Author's coinage. Keep.\n- **元阶 (meta-order)**: Author's coinage. Keep.\n- **The magic book examples**: Whimsical register (猫猫变鼠鼠). Must preserve playful tone.\n- **基石 (keystone)**: Base-level objects in a construction.\n\n---\n\n### Essay 7: 范畴论与境：K1策略\n**\"Category Theory and Jing: The K1 Strategy\"**\n\n**Summary:** Most technically ambitious. Defines evolution functors T (jing over time) and conversion functors F (between sub-jing). Conjectures stable structures preserved across evolution. Natural transformations = the experience of understanding/alignment. The eta morphism = felt confirmation. \"1+1=2\" example makes this experientially accessible. Language games explained structurally. Philosophical experiments proposed.\n\n**Translation challenges:**\n- **演化**: \"Evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n- **稳定结构**: \"Stable structure\" — invariants preserved across evolution.\n- **The meme sentence**: Chinese internet meme, deliberately incomprehensible. Needs translator's note.\n- **Todo sections**: Preserve as working notes.\n- **eta as experience**: The formal symbol with rich experiential content.\n\n---\n\n### Essay 8 (Appendix): 关于诗意和境的一些零散想法\n**\"Some Scattered Thoughts on Poiesis and Jing\"**\n\n**Summary:** Supplementary reflections. Human condition as non-tragic (constraints enable creation). Coin-flipping as poiesis. Death as transcendent to self. Category theory as one tool among many — poetry, art, memes, desk arrangement all construct jing. We are already poets of our own experience. Two questions: How is philosophy possible? How is meaning possible? Mencius + Socratic quotes frame the collection within both traditions.\n\n**Translation challenges:**\n- **向死而生**: Heidegger's Sein-zum-Tode. Author critiques it.\n- **Draft sections**: Incomplete. Preserve or bracket.\n- **The culminating paragraph**: Near-lyrical register. Rare in this analytic collection.\n\n---\n\n## Part 2 + Appendix Cross-Cutting Observations\n\n1. **境 as central concept**: The categorical structure of experience — formalization of how we organize, connect, and evolve our experiential world.\n\n2. **Fish/Fishing structure vindicated**: Part 1 = instances; Part 2 = the formal method generating those instances.\n\n3. **The collection as philosophical experiment**: 境集 IS a philosophical experiment in its own terms — constructs experiences, then provides formal framework to understand why.\n\n4. **Key terminological chain**: 现象 (phenomena) -> 境 (jing) -> 联想 (association) -> 形而上 (the metaphysical, universal property) -> 形而上学 (metaphysics, construction) -> 诗意 (poiesis, lucid engagement) -> 实践 (practice, overlap of ideal and phenomena)\n\n5. **Author's intellectual profile**: Physicist, mathematician, philosopher, meme-literate. Translation must serve all registers.\n\n6. **Working draft quality**: Todo sections and self-corrections must be preserved — part of philosophical honesty.\n\n---\n\n## Expert Report Notes\n\n### Metaphysics Expert — Key Translation Insights\n\n1. **境 (jing)**: Expert suggests \"Sphere\" or transliterated \"Jing\" with glossary entry. Also considers \"experiential sphere.\" Advises against \"world\" (too broad) or \"state\" (too static).\n2. **形而上 vs. 形而上学**: \"the metaphysical\" vs. \"metaphysics\" — distinction is load-bearing. Both must be rendered distinctly.\n3. **第一/第二/第〇实在**: \"First Reality\" / \"Second Reality\" / \"Zeroth Reality\" — numbering preserved. Footnote clarifying that \"First\" is epistemic, not ontological, is essential.\n4. **恒常**: \"Constancy\" — not \"permanence\" (too strong), not \"regularity\" (too weak), not \"invariance\" (too technical).\n5. **非理性**: \"The non-rational\" — NOT \"irrational.\" Outside reason, not against it.\n6. **现象**: \"Phenomena\" — but closer to phenomenological tradition (Husserl) than to Kant. Not \"mere appearances.\"\n7. **诗意**: \"The poetic\" or \"poiesis.\" NOT poetry in literary sense. Lucid, self-aware engagement with meaning.\n8. **梦境**: \"Dreamscape\" — immersive, constructed quality.\n9. **沉醉/清醒**: \"Intoxicated\" / \"Lucid\" — lucid dreaming metaphor is apt.\n10. **祛魅**: \"Disenchantment\" — maps to Weber's Entzauberung.\n11. **联想**: \"Association\" — morphisms in E. Hume's association of ideas precedent, but upgraded via category theory.\n12. **The 3-reality schema parallels**: Kantian noumenon (第〇), Husserlian Lebenswelt (第一), Carnapian frameworks (第二).\n13. **Essays function as philosophical experiments** — experiential sequences are load-bearing, not merely illustrative. Must prioritize experiential rhythm over literal accuracy where they conflict.\n\n### Phenomenology Expert — Key Translation Insights\n\n1. **P as Lebenswelt**: The totality of phenomena functions like Husserl's pre-theoretical lifeworld. P is the \"phenomenological field\" given formal character.\n2. **Tower structure = infinite iterability of reflection**: Morphisms becoming objects mirrors phenomenological insight that acts of consciousness can become objects of new acts recursively.\n3. **Universal properties = eidetic constitution**: The concept of \"pen\" as terminal object in a subcategory formalizes Husserl's eidetic constitution — how essences are constituted through synthesis of particulars.\n4. **Ship of Theseus = noematic nucleus**: The feeling that serves as universal property linking associated experiences is precisely Husserl's noematic Kern.\n5. **感受 (ganshou)**: \"Feeling\" or \"felt experience\" — carries weight of both Husserl's Empfindung and Michel Henry's affection. NOT mere \"sensation.\"\n6. **体验 (tiyan)**: \"Lived experience\" — Chinese equivalent of Erlebnis.\n7. **E-notation**: Author's own E = Enclosed/Emotion/Experience. Expert suggests \"Enclosure\" as possible rendering but notes it loses Chinese resonances.\n8. **Introspection as phenomenological method**: Using structural relations as a \"map\" to navigate experience = close to Husserl's free variation.\n9. **eta = fulfilled intention (erfullte Intention)**: When eta is identity, meaning-intention is perfectly filled by the given object.\n10. **Intersubjectivity via eta**: Sidesteps qualia problem entirely. Two people share understanding when structural alignment has the same form. Improves on Husserl's appresentation.\n11. **Bootstrapping problem remains**: How do two E-structures become coordinated through interaction? This is the residual question.\n\n### Epistemology Expert — Key Translation Insights\n\n1. **知识 (zhishi)**: \"Knowledge\" — but author's analysis shows it is closer to \"what is believed to be correct.\"\n2. **信念 (xinnian)**: \"Belief\" — Chinese carries stronger conviction connotations than English technical usage.\n3. **证实关系 (zhengshi guanxi)**: \"Justification relation\" or \"verification relation\" — 证实 means both justify and verify. In K1, these are morphisms in the knowledge category.\n4. **知识的发生 (zhishi de fasheng)**: \"The genesis of knowledge\" or \"the occurrence of knowledge\" — event-like, dynamic. Neither \"knowledge formation\" nor \"knowledge emergence\" is perfect.\n5. **稳定结构 (wending jiegou)**: \"Stable structure\" — author's replacement for \"a priori categories.\" Keep mathematical character.\n6. **Access argument**: The shift from \"what justification bases are\" to \"how we access them\" is the essay's most important move. \"Methodological phenomenalism\" applied to epistemology.\n7. **Bob examples are load-bearing**: Three Bobs must appear in exact sequence with specific details (sprinkler, emotional absorption). They are a philosophical experiment.\n8. **Meno paradox resolution**: Structural-gap account — we know what we seek by the shape of what is missing. Original and precise.\n9. **JTB dissolution**: Author doesn't add a 4th condition (post-Gettier) or reject one — shows truth and justification both reduce to belief in practice. More radical than most contemporary positions.\n\n### Existentialism Expert — Key Translation Insights\n\n1. **荒谬 (huangmiu)**: \"Absurdity\" — but Chinese term carries stronger \"ridiculousness\" connotation than French absurde. This actually serves the argument: the absurd IS ridiculous because it's a misdirected search.\n2. **虚无 (xuwu)**: \"The void\" (substantive) / \"nihilism\" (虚无主义). Chinese term has Daoist cosmological resonance (productive void) absent from Nietzsche's Nihilismus. Translator's note needed.\n3. **诗意**: Expert recommends \"the poetic\" with \"poetic dwelling\" in habitative contexts. Needs translator's essay explaining it functions like Heidegger's Dichtung — world-disclosing activity, not versification.\n4. **超越/超越性**: \"Transcendence\" — but used in 3 senses: (a) beyond self, (b) beyond phenomena, (c) outward-reaching quality of goals. Annotation needed.\n5. **Author's 诗意 vs. Western alternatives**: More livable than Nietzsche's amor fati (too ecstatic), Camus's revolt (too heroic), Heidegger's Gelassenheit (too quietist). It is active but not heroic, aware but not detached.\n6. **Cat example**: Will likely become a memorable philosophical example in its own right. The mundane is philosophically decisive precisely because it is ordinary.\n7. **Death critique**: Author's objection to Heidegger's Sein-zum-Tode — death we \"live toward\" is always our conception of death shaped by our framework, not death itself.\n8. **Coin-flip as 诗意**: Compact example of lucid engagement — you must genuinely invest in the constructed 境 for it to work.\n\n### Philosophy of Mind Expert — Key Translation Insights\n\n1. **E as cognitive architecture**: Category theory captures composability and hierarchy of mental operations, not just static structure. Morphism composition = coherent chains of association.\n2. **Arrows-only metacategory**: No fundamental distinction between \"a concept\" and \"an association between concepts.\" Resonates with William James's radical empiricism.\n3. **Tower structure = meta-cognition**: T_1 = thinking about thinking. Flattening property = meta-cognitive levels coexist in unified field (matching phenomenological observation).\n4. **Meta-order is non-intrinsic**: Dragon blood example — which level of abstraction something is at depends on cognitive history. No direct analogue in standard Higher-Order Thought theories.\n5. **S_E as a priori cognitive structures**: Parallels Kant's categories, Chomsky's Universal Grammar, Spelke's core knowledge. Framework contribution: characterizes these as structural invariants under categorical evolution.\n6. **Basket metaphor (篮子)**: Captures cognitive closure (McGinn) — what hasn't entered P is unavailable for processing. Transforms metaphysical limit into empirical research program.\n7. **eta as \"feeling of knowing\"**: Formally precise phenomenological characterization of understanding. When eta is identity = \"mastery\" (掌握). Naturality condition = \"transfer\" in education.\n8. **联想 (lianxiang)**: \"Association\" — but richer. Classical associationism (Hume) upgraded with composability and identity. Closer to \"cognitive morphism.\"\n9. **Universal properties as \"the feeling of a concept\"**: Not a definition or prototype but a quale — the characteristic feeling of pen-ness functioning as terminal object.\n10. **Intersubjectivity**: Subsumes Zahavi's empathy, Gallese's shared manifold, Brandom's inferentialism as special cases.\n\n### Kantian Expert — Key Translation Insights\n\n1. **Author's 第一实在 is pre-categorical**: Closer to Kant's \"manifold of intuition\" before synthesis, or even sensory \"matter\" of appearance, than to Kantian Erscheinung (always already constituted). More Husserlian than Kantian.\n2. **S_E parallels Kantian categories**: But author leaves S_E unspecified (to be discovered empirically), unlike Kant who deduces from table of judgments. Author's approach is more neo-Kantian.\n3. **\"Another kind of Kantian question\"**: Author explicitly frames \"How is meaning possible?\" as parallel to \"How is synthetic a priori knowledge possible?\" — extending Kantian architecture to meaning/value.\n4. **Category theory vs. table of categories**: Universal properties replace Kantian categories, functors replace schematism, natural transformations replace synthetic unity of apperception. Genuine formalization of what Kant gestured at.\n5. **Dynamic vs. static**: Author introduces evolution functor T, making experience fundamentally dynamic. Kant's framework is static — categories don't change.\n6. **eta addresses Kant's intersubjectivity gap**: Kant assumes all rational beings share same cognitive architecture but never proves it. Author's eta provides a structural, testable criterion.\n7. **Non-rationality divergence**: Kant would never call the drive for metaphysics \"non-rational\" — for him, reason's demand for the unconditioned IS rational.\n8. **形而上 reinterpretation**: Author reads 形 in 形而上者谓之道 as 现象 (phenomena), not the traditional \"visible form.\" This is a significant hermeneutical move that should be noted.\n\n### Chinese Philosophy Expert — Key Translation Insights\n\n1. **道德仁义礼 reversal**: No Chinese philosopher has explicitly argued the entire hierarchy is a phenomenological construction built bottom-up. Closest precedent is Xunzi's empiricism about 礼, but Xunzi never extended to 道 itself.\n2. **德 (de)**: \"Inherent character\" or retain \"De.\" NOT \"virtue\" (imports moral connotations author strips away). NOT \"essence\" (imports Western metaphysical baggage being deconstructed). Author's constructivist spin: 德 is assembled from inductively generalized properties then normatively imposed as definitional.\n3. **仁 (ren)**: \"Humaneness\" or \"fellow-feeling\" — author emphasizes inner feeling first, behavioral expression second.\n4. **义 (yi)**: \"Moral impetus\" or \"sense of obligation\" — author emphasizes motivational bridge quality.\n5. **礼 (li)**: \"Ritual conduct\" or \"patterned behavior\" at phenomenal level. NOT religious ceremony.\n6. **境 as Chinese concept**: Author preserves core Buddhist insight that 境 is structured by mind, not \"the world out there.\" But transforms: formalized via category theory, given dynamic evolution. Closest traditional resonance is 境界 in its most general sense.\n7. **诗意 as synthesis**: Chinese aesthetic tradition (意境) + Buddhist awareness (觉/悟) + Western post-nihilist existentialism. Rooted in Chinese sensibility but not confined by it.\n8. **恒常 vs. Daoist 常 vs. Buddhist 无常**: Author's 恒常 is epistemological/pragmatic — what we seek in phenomena. Not ontological like Daoist 常 (eternal pattern) or Buddhist 无常 (no permanence).\n9. **虚无 vs. Buddhist 空**: Completely different. Author's 虚无 = absence of transcendent ground. Buddhist 空 = dependent origination. Must NOT be conflated.\n10. **Essays as experiments**: Parallels classical Chinese method — Mencius's 孺子入井, Zhuangzi's parables. The form IS the method. Translation must preserve experiential arc.\n11. **Double burden of every key term**: Traditional resonance + author's reinterpretation. Translator must preserve both.\n\n### Buddhism Expert — Key Translation Insights\n\n1. **境 and Yogacara visaya**: Author preserves insight that 境 is domain as structured by mind, not \"world out there.\" But enriches: formalizes relations between object-takings, not just object-takings themselves.\n2. **Tower structure resonates with Hua-yen (华严)**: Indra's net — mutual reflection, tower-like structure. Fa-zang's metaphor is the single best Buddhist image for what the tower construction formalizes.\n3. **Post-metaphysics = Middle Way**: Pre-metaphysics (eternalism/常见) -> nihilism (断见) -> post-metaphysics (middle way). Remarkably precise structural parallel.\n4. **清醒的梦境 parallels Chan awakening**: \"Mountains are mountains again\" — third stage. Full engagement with full awareness. Diamond Sutra: \"contemplate them thus while continuing practice.\"\n5. **Self as universal property = anatman**: \"I\" as terminal object in subcategory, not substance = Middle Way on self. Neither eternalism nor nihilism.\n6. **恒常 = first cognitive inversion (viparyasa)**: Taking impermanent as permanent. Author's analysis parallels Buddhist diagnosis precisely.\n7. **Critical difference from Buddhism**: Author proposes \"post-metaphysical constancy-seeking\" (recognize and work with it lucidly) rather than \"cessation of constancy-seeking\" (overcome through insight).\n8. **清醒 carries overtones of 觉 (bodhi)**: \"Lucid\" best preserves both clear-seeing and dreamscape context. Avoid \"awakened\" (too Buddhist) and \"conscious\" (too Cartesian).\n9. **Author's 虚无 is NOT sunyata**: Kumarajiva rendered sunyata as 空 precisely to avoid confusion with 無. Author follows this distinction implicitly. Must be noted.\n10. **Philosophical experiments = upaya (skillful means)**: Buddhist pedagogical tradition treats teachings as devices for producing experiential transformations. Koans are the purest example.\n\n### Wittgenstein Expert — Key Translation Insights\n\n1. **Language games reoriented**: Author treats language games as probes (methodological instruments), not as bedrock (Wittgenstein's use). Closer to Brandom's appropriation — taking primacy of practice and embedding in systematic project.\n2. **Structure/meaning resolution via natural transformation**: Neither generates the other; they must be aligned. Formalizes Wittgenstein's meaning-as-use insight that meaning and use are co-constitutive.\n3. **Natural transformation subsumes both picture theory AND meaning-as-use**: Picture theory as special case (eta = isomorphism); later Wittgenstein as general case (eta = experiential alignment).\n4. **Philosophical therapy explained structurally**: Tension (张力) = subcategory lacking well-defined universal property. Therapy = restructuring category to resolve tension. Wittgenstein would resist the explanation but the account provides positive criterion for when puzzlement arises.\n5. **理解 vs. 掌握**: \"Understanding\" vs. \"mastery/direct grasp.\" 掌握 = eta is identity morphism = no mediation. Important distinction for translation.\n6. **Private language argument compatibility**: Author's structural position criterion IS the public criterion Wittgenstein argues sensation-terms must have. Beetle-in-the-box: private content drops out; structural role remains.\n7. **On Certainty parallels**: Author's analysis and OC arrive at similar conclusions. But author dissolves knowledge/belief distinction entirely (more pragmatist); Wittgenstein preserves the grammar via hinge propositions.\n8. **Forms of life vs. 境**: Parallel but not identical. Forms of life are communal background; 境 is individual structural medium. Different starting points, overlapping territory.\n9. **Kripkenstein problem addressed**: Naturality condition constrains eta globally, not just at finitely many points — no room for quaddition-like deviance.\n10. **Essays as experiments**: Most Wittgensteinian aspect — philosophy as activity, not doctrine. Medium is the message.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Expert Consensus on Translation\n\nAll 9 experts converge on several critical points:\n\n1. **境 should be transliterated as \"Jing\"** (or left as E in technical passages), with extensive translator's note. No single English word works.\n\n2. **Experiential sequences are load-bearing**: The Sisyphus/cat progression, the 道德仁义礼 reversal, the Bob examples, the 1+1=2 passage — all function as philosophical experiments on the reader. Reordering, summarizing, or abstracting them destroys the philosophical content. ALL experts flag this independently.\n\n3. **诗意 = \"the Poetic\"** (capitalized as philosophical stance, like \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\"). Needs translator's essay. Not poetry, not aesthetics — an existential stance.\n\n4. **恒常 = \"Constancy\"**: Universal agreement across experts.\n\n5. **非理性 = \"the non-rational\"**: Universal agreement. NOT \"irrational.\"\n\n6. **形而上 vs. 形而上学**: Must be rendered distinctly. \"The metaphysical\" vs. \"metaphysics.\"\n\n7. **The eta/natural transformation accounts for intersubjectivity**: Multiple experts (metaphysics, phenomenology, epistemology, existentialism, phil-mind, Kantian, Chinese phil, Buddhism, Wittgenstein) independently identify this as the framework's most significant innovation. Translation should make this connection visible.\n\n8. **Author arrives independently at positions convergent with multiple Western traditions**: Husserl (phenomenological reduction), Heidegger (critique of metaphysics, poetic dwelling), Wittgenstein (private language, meaning-as-use), Nagarjuna (emptiness, middle way), Kant (transcendental conditions). Translation must make resonances visible without reducing author's independent achievement to \"influence.\"\n\n---\n\n## Overall Translation Approach\n\n### 1. Title and Central Term\n\n**境集 = \"Jing Ji\"** (romanized), with a translator's introduction explaining the term. The title will appear as:\n\n> **Jing Ji** (境集)\n> *Collected Essays on Jing*\n\nThe term **境 (Jing)** will be transliterated throughout and treated as a proper philosophical term (like Dasein, Dao, or Dharma). On first occurrence in each essay, it receives an inline gloss: \"Jing (境, the structured experiential field).\" The formal symbol **E** is used in technical/mathematical passages (as the author does). The translator's introduction will explain why no single English word works — 境 simultaneously denotes a bounded experiential domain, the categorical structure of that domain, and the felt quality of inhabiting it.\n\n### 2.

Preserve. |\n\n### 3. Register Strategy\n\nThe collection moves between at least 5 registers. The translation must preserve these shifts:\n\n1. **Colloquial/thinking-aloud** (Essays 1, 3, parts of 8): Informal, exploratory, sometimes humorous. Use natural conversational English. Preserve run-on thoughts, self-corrections, parenthetical asides.\n\n2. **Analytic philosophy** (Essay 2, parts of 4): Precise, argumentative, uses technical terms (JTB, justification, phenomena). Already in English for Essay 2 — use as the register standard.\n\n3. **Classical Chinese quotation** (Laozi, Mengzi, Yijing in Essays 4, 8): Romanize and gloss. Provide standard English translations of classical passages, with notes on how the author departs from standard readings.\n\n4. **Mathematical/formal** (Essays 6, 7): Standard mathematical English. Preserve all notation. Category theory terms use established English conventions (functor, morphism, natural transformation, universal property, etc.).\n\n5. **Near-lyrical/poetic** (Essay 5 climax, Essay 8 conclusion): Rare in this collection, which makes these moments load-bearing. Preserve the shift to elevated register.\n\n### 4. Classical Chinese Quotation Format\n\n**Format for 文言 (classical Chinese) quotations:**\n\n1. Present original 文言 text as a **block quote**\n2. Follow with **glossed English translation** — key terms glossed on first occurrence as \"English (漢字, pinyin)\", e.g., \"humaneness (仁, ren)\"\n3. After first introduction, use **plain English only** — e.g., just \"humaneness\"\n4. **现象X compounds** (现象仁, 现象礼, 现象义) keep the \"phenomenal\" prefix **always** — never drop it. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (author's coinage for lived experience) is load-bearing for the argument.\n\n**Refinements:**\n- Re-gloss briefly at **register transitions** — when the same term (e.g., 仁) shifts from classical quotation to the author's modern analysis, add a brief \"(仁)\" reminder\n- Only gloss **philosophically load-bearing terms**, not every content word\n- For the author's coined compounds (现象仁 etc.), no romanization needed after first gloss — \"phenomenal humaneness\" is self-explanatory\n- Make the 文言/modern Chinese boundary visible through **formatting** (block-indent for classical quotations vs. running text for the author's analysis)\n\n*Unanimously endorsed by all 9 experts.*\n\n### 5. Structural Principles\n\n1. **Preserve experiential sequences exactly**. Every expert independently flagged this. The Sisyphus-to-cat progression, the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li reversal, the three Bobs, the 1+1=2 passage — these are philosophical experiments. Do not reorder, summarize, or abstract.\n\n2. **Preserve working-draft quality**. Todo sections, self-corrections, incomplete passages, and authorial hedges (\"I think,\" \"perhaps\") are part of the philosophical honesty of the collection. Do not polish them away.\n\n3. **Preserve the bilingual nature**. Essay 2 is in English. The collection is deliberately bilingual. The Chinese-to-English translation encompasses 7 essays + table of contents. Essay 2 stays as-is (with minor harmonization of terminology if needed).\n\n4. **Preserve the fish/fishing structure**. Part 1 (上集：鱼) and Part 2 (下集：渔) must retain the structural metaphor. Translate as \"Upper Collection: Fish\" and \"Lower Collection: Fishing\" (or similar), with a translator's note on the proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔.\n\n5. **Footnotes and sidenotes**: Author's footnotes are often philosophically essential (e.g., Essay 1 footnote 2, Essay 4 footnote 25). Translate all footnotes. Add translator's notes sparingly — only where (a) a Chinese cultural reference would be opaque to English readers, (b) a Western philosophical parallel would help, or (c) the internet meme requires explanation.\n\n### 6. Translator's Apparatus (Planned)\n\n1. **Translator's Introduction**: Short essay explaining the title (Jing Ji), the author's intellectual profile (physicist-philosopher), the bilingual nature, the fish/fishing structure, and the experimental/performative dimension of the essays. Alert readers that experiential sequences are load-bearing.\n\n2. **Glossary**: Full glossary of key terms with romanization, Chinese characters, and explanations.\n\n3. **Translator's Notes**: Inline footnotes marked [TN] to distinguish from author's notes.\n\n### 7. Reference Translations (Classical Chinese Passages)\n\n**Daodejing Chapter 38 — 故失道而后德，失德而后仁，失仁而后义，失义而后礼**\n\n**Philip J. Ivanhoe** (*The Daodejing of Laozi*, Hackett Classics, 2002, Chapter 38):\n> \"And so,\n> When the Way was lost there was Virtue;\n> When Virtue was lost there was benevolence;\n> When benevolence was lost there was righteousness;\n> When righteousness was lost there were the rites.\"\n\nIvanhoe's vocabulary: 道 → the Way | 德 → Virtue (capitalized) | 仁 → benevolence | 义 → righteousness | 礼 → the rites\n\n**D.C. Lau** (*Tao Te Ching*, Penguin Classics):\n> \"When the way was lost there was virtue; when virtue was lost there was benevolence; when benevolence was lost there was rectitude; when rectitude was lost there were the rites.\"\n\n**Wing-tsit Chan** (*A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy*):\n> \"When the Way is lost, only then do we have virtue; when virtue is lost, only then do we have humanity; when humanity is lost, only then do we have righteousness; when righteousness is lost, only then do we have propriety.\"\n\n*Note: May be cited in a TN if we use our own rendering in the block quote, to acknowledge standard translations and signal the departure is deliberate.*\n\n---\n\n### 8. Expert Consultation Results (All Resolved)\n\nAll 7 questions resolved through expert consultation. See Q-files for full details.\n\n- **Q1: 诗意 = \"the Poetic\"** (RESOLVED). Capitalized as substantive, lowercase as adjective. First occurrence: \"the poetic (诗意, shiyi)\" + footnote. Experts: existentialism + phenomenology, both endorse.\n- **Q2: 境集 = \"Jing Ji\"** (RESOLVED). Pure romanization, no subtitle (or \"Essays on Jing\" if publisher requires). Translator's introduction explains 境. Expert: Chinese philosophy.\n- **Q3: Essay 2 untouched + minimal apparatus** (RESOLVED). Do not edit author's English. Add prefatory note (3-4 sentences) + 3 translator's footnotes connecting \"digestion,\" \"what each individual believes,\" and \"standard\" to formal counterparts. Preserve register difference as feature. Expert: epistemology.\n- **Q4: 梦境 = \"dreamscape\"** (RESOLVED). Preserves Diamond Sutra dream-simile, \"-scape\" signals constructed environment, avoids \"realm\" cosmological baggage. Surreal connotation contextually controlled. Expert: Buddhism.\n- **Q5: Meme sentence = English meme replacement + translator's note** (RESOLVED). Replace with English grammatically-plausible-but-semantically-void sentence. Literal translation would produce \"bad translation\" experience, not \"natively incomprehensible\" experience — different structural positions. Note cites original Chinese. Expert: Wittgenstein.\n- **Q6: 虚妄 = \"vain presumption\"** (RESOLVED). NOT Buddhist 虚妄 (mṛṣā). \"Vain\" = empty + conceited (mirrors Chinese double meaning). \"Presumption\" = claiming impossible standpoint. Footnote disambiguates from Buddhist usage. Expert: Buddhism.\n- **Q7: 形 = 现象 note = Introduction paragraph + footnote** (RESOLVED). Half-page in Translator's Introduction explaining Xici zhuan source and author's departure. Footnote at first occurrence of the quotation in Essay 4. Western readers would not notice the reinterpretation without a note, flattening the author's originality. Expert: Chinese philosophy.\n\n","numLines":476,"startLine":1,"totalLines":476}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"b618ca93-5579-434e-a55d-07c0e0e3ebfe"}

The essay opens casually (\"今天有一些...想法\" — \"Today I had some thoughts about...\") and maintains a discursive, exploratory tone. The author reasons through a problem in real time, with self-corrections (\"然而仔细一想\" — \"but on closer thought\") and hedges (\"似乎\" — \"it seems\"). This working-draft quality is structural (B4 applies: do not polish away).\n    12→\n    13→**Pacing:** The argument moves in a clear dialectical rhythm: (1) initial claim (collective interest doesn't exist), (2) reversal via renormalization analogy, (3) examples (ocean/molecules), (4) deeper consequence about human individuality and empathy, (5) law as mediating between scales, (6) coda on abstraction itself. The pacing is unhurried and deliberate — each step builds on the last. The translation must preserve this patient unfolding.\n    14→\n    15→**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n    16→- The **renormalization (重整化)** analogy is the essay's load-bearing metaphor. It recurs throughout and connects to technical physics concepts. The translator will need to keep it consistent and accessible without dumbing it down. Dictionary term must be respected.\n    17→- **Nested parenthetical qualifications** are characteristic — e.g., \"人类群体（作为一个整体）\" — these create a thinking-aloud texture. In English, excessive parentheticals can feel labored; we need to preserve the qualifier texture without making sentences unreadable.\n    18→- **Bold emphasis** is used sparingly but structurally: \"**在宏观层面上，群体能否被当作一个整体来认知**\" and \"**只有**...才能\". These must carry over exactly (B5).\n    19→- **Footnotes** are substantive and philosophical, not merely bibliographic. Footnote 2 is a full paragraph of argumentation. The footnotes are part of the essay's experiential fabric — they read like asides in the author's thinking process (R6: verify footnote integration doesn't break momentum).\n    20→\n    21→**Register Shifts:** Minimal. The essay stays in the thinking-aloud register almost throughout, with slight elevation when making the renormalization analogy more formal. The FAQ callout box introduces a question-to-self quality.\n    22→\n    23→**Experiential Observation:** The essay performs the very thing it describes — it starts from the individual's perspective and tries to reason outward to the collective, demonstrating the limitation it articulates. The translation must preserve this performative dimension.\n    24→\n    25→---\n    26→\n    27→### Essay 2: A Thought on Knowledge\n    28→\n    29→**Register & Voice:** This essay is NATIVELY WRITTEN IN ENGLISH (B6 applies: do NOT harmonize with translated essays). The register is analytic-academic but with a distinct informal undercurrent — the author repeatedly uses first-person perspective (\"my confusion,\" \"my take\") and colloquial phrasing (\"knowledge is just... belief?\"). The ellipsis with question mark is a signature rhetorical move — the author arrives at a conclusion that surprises even themselves.\n    30→\n    31→**Pacing:** The essay follows a methodical, almost pedagogical structure: define terms, propose an example (\"It is raining outside\"), analyze each component of JTB in sequence, arrive at a disruptive conclusion. The pacing is patient and systematic — each step is laid out before the next. The three Bob/Alice examples (rain scenarios) are a key experiential sequence: the third example (#3) deliberately breaks from epistemological analysis into something almost lyrical (\"His thoughts flowed among the changes of light reflected by the water\"). This register shift from analytic to near-lyrical is load-bearing — it demonstrates how phenomena can be experienced without being converted to propositional knowledge.\n    32→\n    33→**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n    34→- The prose has some rough edges that are FEATURES, not bugs: slightly awkward constructions (\"my take to it\"), occasional verbosity, and a working-draft conversational quality. B4 demands these be preserved. However, there are also genuine infelicities that may need flagging — distinguishing these from intentional roughness is the central editorial challenge.\n    35→- The **Sidenotes section** is extensive and functions as a secondary essay. Its tone is slightly more formal-pedagogical than the main text. The sidenotes on high-energy physics and mathematics are substantial intellectual arguments, not mere clarifications.\n    36→- The \"circular justified beliefs\" sidenote escalates into a reductio ad absurdum about babies having knowledge, before-lives, and \"a glitch in video games\" — this is a deliberately playful-absurdist register within an otherwise analytic essay. Do not flatten this tonal shift.\n    37→- The acknowledgment \"I would like to thank Claude for drafting the abstract\" is a notable meta-textual moment.\n    38→\n    39→**Register Shifts:** Analytic -> near-lyrical (Bob scenario #3) -> back to analytic -> playful-absurdist (circular justification sidenote). These shifts are all deliberate and must be preserved.\n    40→\n    41→**Experiential Observation:** The essay's structure mirrors its thesis — it proceeds by belief, checking, and revision, performing the epistemic process it analyzes. The reader experiences the same progression from confidence to uncertainty that the essay describes.\n    42→\n    43→---\n    44→\n    45→### Essay 3: 西西弗斯、班与猫 (Sisyphus, Work, and Cats)\n    46→\n    47→**Register & Voice:** Conversational-philosophical, more personal and narrative-driven than Essay 1. The essay opens with a personal anecdote (\"About a year ago, I discussed absurdism with a friend\") and maintains a warm, exploratory tone. The voice is that of someone thinking through a puzzle, arriving at insight through concrete examples rather than abstract argument. The author's personality shines through more strongly here — there is humor, directness, and a kind of affectionate irreverence toward grand philosophical problems.\n    48→\n    49→**Pacing:** The essay has a masterful three-act structure with escalating concreteness:\n    50→1. Sisyphus (mythological/abstract) -> 2. The office worker (modern/relatable) -> 3. The cat owner (intimate/domestic). Each example is *less* dramatic than the last, and this de-escalation IS the philosophical argument: absurdity dissolves as we move from \"cosmic\" to \"everyday.\" The pacing mirrors the thesis — the essay itself becomes less tense, more relaxed, more at home as it progresses. This is load-bearing pacing (S3 applies strongly).\n    51→\n    52→**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n    53→- The **interrupted thought** at the end of the office worker section: \"而上述例子中的人则还尚未——\" (and the person in this example has not yet--). The em dash trailing off is a dramatic rhetorical device, immediately followed by \"但是等一等\" (but wait a moment). This interruption-and-pivot is performative: the reader is meant to feel the turn. Translation must capture this exact rhythm.\n    54→- The **cat passage** is the essay's climax precisely because it is anticlimactic. The prose becomes warmer, more specific (waking up to meowing, cleaning cat hair, scratched furniture), and the conclusion is deliberately simple: \"just because we want to keep a cat, because we like life with a cat, and that is all.\" The simplicity is the point. The English must resist any urge to elevate or ornament — plainness here is the philosophical payoff.\n    55→- **Alienation (异化)** appears as a technical philosophical term within an otherwise casual passage — this register mixing is intentional.\n    56→- The **parenthetical English** \"(off-tone)\" appears in the original Chinese text — an interesting bilingual moment that should be preserved and noted.\n    57→- **Repetition of \"事实上\" (in fact / actually)** throughout — this is characteristic of the author's thinking-aloud style and must be preserved (B9 on intentional repetition).\n    58→\n    59→**Register Shifts:** The essay moves between narrative, philosophical analysis, and intimate-domestic description. The transitions are smooth — there are no jarring gear shifts. The most significant shift is the tonal de-escalation across the three examples.\n    60→\n    61→**Experiential Observation:** The essay performs its own thesis: the reader's experience moves from abstract philosophical puzzlement (Sisyphus) to recognition (the office worker) to warm, familiar comfort (the cat). By the end, absurdity has dissolved for the reader too. The translation must reproduce this experiential arc.\n    62→\n    63→---\n    64→\n    65→### Essay 4: 后形而上学 整理 (Post-Metaphysics, Organized)\n    66→\n    67→**Register & Voice:** This is the most formally structured essay so far. The register is analytic-expository with a systematic, textbook-like quality: numbered categories (第〇种, 第一种, 第二种, 第三种 metaphysics), defined terminology (italicized special terms), and explicit footnotes that function as scholarly apparatus. Yet the voice remains personal — the author says \"I created this term,\" uses \"we\" inclusively, and includes hedges (\"似乎\"). The meta-textual preface openly acknowledges this is an \"organized\" version of an earlier draft, and that terms differ from philosophical tradition — this working-draft transparency is a feature (B4).\n    68→\n    69→**Pacing:** The essay moves in a careful building-block progression: (1) define \"pre-metaphysics\" and phenomena as \"first reality,\" (2) elaborate via Laozi's hierarchy (dao-de-ren-yi-li), (3) show the reversal of generative direction, (4) classify four types of metaphysical understanding (Types 0-3), (5) discuss the \"objective world\" as model, (6) address nihilism and irrationality, (7) arrive at post-metaphysics. The pacing is deliberately pedagogical — each concept must be digested before the next arrives. The essay does NOT rush; it trusts the reader to follow layer by layer.\n    70→\n    71→**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n    72→- **Italic/bold formatting is SYSTEMATIC and load-bearing.** Italics mark defined/special terms (现象, 恒常, 第一实在, 第二实在, etc.). Bold marks emphasis and key claims. This is not decoration — it is the essay's notational system. The translation must preserve every instance exactly (B5). This will be one of the most format-intensive essays to edit.\n    73→- **The Laozi passage and its analysis** is the essay's most challenging section. The author takes 道-德-仁-义-礼 and re-reads them phenomenologically, inventing terms like \"phenomenal-li (现象礼),\" \"phenomenal-ren (现象仁),\" \"phenomenal-yi (现象义).\" The translation must handle these hybrid terms carefully — they are the author's own coinages, not standard philosophical vocabulary. Dictionary conventions must be checked.\n    74→- **\"第〇实在\" / \"第一实在\" / \"第二实在\"** (Zeroth Reality, First Reality, Second Reality) — the numbering system is non-standard and philosophically significant. The ordinals carry meaning (zero = what would be \"below\" phenomena, first = phenomena themselves, second = constructs above phenomena).\n    75→- **Footnotes are EXTENSIVE (16 footnotes)** and range from brief clarifications to substantial philosophical arguments. Footnote 1 is a meta-textual formatting guide. Footnotes 3 and 6 are paragraph-length explanations. These need careful integration (R6).\n    76→- **The section on irrationality (非理性)** introduces a new register — more urgent, almost confessional. The claim that the pursuit of metaphysics is itself irrational, and that this irrationality must be \"acknowledged,\" has existential weight.\n    77→- **Classical Chinese quotations** (Laozi, Yijing) appear embedded in the argument, not as decorative epigraphs. Their translation must be functional within the argument, not just elegant.\n    78→\n    79→**Register Shifts:** Expository-analytic throughout, but with notable shifts: (a) the Laozi analysis section becomes more intricate and recursive; (b) the nihilism/irrationality section becomes more urgent and existential; (c) the closing paragraphs on post-metaphysics become almost programmatic/declarative.\n    80→\n    81→**Experiential Observation:** The essay enacts the very process it describes — it builds up a metaphysical framework (types 0-3), only to show that all such frameworks are constructions from phenomena. The reader constructs the understanding that understanding is construction. The circularity is deliberate and performative.\n    82→\n    83→---\n    84→\n    85→### Essay 5: 形而上学后的目的：诗意 (The Purpose After Metaphysics: The Poetic)\n    86→\n    87→**Register & Voice:** The register shifts significantly from Essay 4's systematic exposition to something more lyrical and existentially urgent. The opening paragraph recapitulates Essay 4's conclusion about irrationality, then pivots: \"But meaning and purpose are not nonexistent things — in fact, we live within meaning every day.\" This pivot signals a change in emotional temperature. The essay's voice becomes more intimate, more searching. The key term \"梦境\" (dreamscape) is introduced with the author openly admitting they cannot find a precise name for it — this vulnerability is structural.\n    88→\n    89→**Pacing:** Shorter and more concentrated than Essay 4. Two main movements: (1) the concept of \"dreamscape\" as the environment in which meaning arises, (2) the distinction between intoxicated and lucid dreamscapes. The pacing accelerates toward the conclusion — the final paragraph is dense, almost aphoristic, and the last sentence (\"如此便是清醒的梦境，是谓之诗意也\" — \"This is the lucid dreamscape, and this is what is called the poetic\") has the weight of a philosophical declaration.\n    90→\n    91→**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n    92→- **\"梦境\" (dreamscape/dream-realm)** is the central concept. The author explicitly lists alternative words they considered: \"game, book, adventure, small world, small freedom, etc.\" This naming hesitancy is part of the essay's texture — the concept resists precise naming. The dictionary term must be used, but the surrounding list of alternatives must also be preserved.\n    93→- **\"诗意\" (the poetic/poetic quality)** is the essay's destination. This term carries enormous weight in the collection. Its translation must be both philosophically precise and experientially resonant. It is NOT \"poetry\" but something like \"poetic-ness\" or \"the quality of being poetic.\"\n    94→- The **bold/italic formatting system** continues from Essay 4 — italics for special terms, bold for emphasis. The passage \"我们**必须**拥抱一些梦境\" (we **must** embrace certain dreamscapes) uses bold for existential urgency, not mere logical emphasis.\n    95→- **Three-part metaphor chain**: \"感性的涌动、体验的结晶、情绪的湍流\" (the surge of sensibility, the crystallization of experience, the turbulence of emotion) — this near-lyrical sequence within an analytical essay is a crucial register shift. The translation must preserve both the rhythm and the specific imagery (surge, crystallization, turbulence).\n    96→- **The intoxicated vs. lucid dreamscape distinction** is the essay's philosophical payload. The examples of \"lucid\" — \"playing a game while knowing it is a game; reading a novel while knowing it is a novel; burning joss paper to express grief; holding a ceremony to show importance\" — move from the modern-casual to the culturally specific. The translation must handle these examples without over-explaining.\n    97→- **Footnote 2** introduces a distinction between two kinds of \"feeling\" (受到之感觉 vs. the \"crystallization/surge/turbulence\") that is philosophically precise and terminologically important.\n    98→- **Footnote 3** is personally revealing — the author defines their own idiosyncratic usage of \"虚妄\" dating back to middle school. This personal etymology is a feature (B4).\n    99→\n   100→**Register Shifts:** Analytic-recapitulative (opening) -> naming-hesitant/exploratory (dreamscape section) -> near-lyrical (the \"surge/crystallization/turbulence\" passage) -> urgent-existential (the \"you cannot abandon all dreamscapes\" passage) -> declarative-aphoristic (conclusion).\n   101→\n   102→**Experiential Observation:** The essay IS a dreamscape about dreamscapes. The reader enters the concept through the game analogy, experiences the naming difficulty, feels the existential urgency of the \"you cannot escape\" passage, and arrives at \"the poetic\" as both a philosophical concept and an experiential destination. The conclusion performs what it names.\n   103→\n   104→---\n   105→\n   106→### Essay 6: 范畴论与境 整理 (Category Theory and Jing, Organized)\n   107→\n   108→**Register & Voice:** The most technically dense essay in the collection. The register oscillates between three distinct modes: (a) mathematical/formal (category theory definitions with LaTeX notation), (b) narrative-playful (the \"magic book\" examples), and (c) philosophical-reflective (the sections on metaphysics, P, E, and jing). The voice remains personal even in the most technical passages — \"I\" is always present, and the magic book examples are written with genuine narrative charm (the professor \"slacking off\" while writing spellbooks). The essay's preface openly marks it as an organized draft with unfinished portions removed.\n   109→\n   110→**Pacing:** The essay has a pedagogical architecture: formal definition -> illustrative example -> philosophical interpretation, repeated in cycles. The pacing is necessarily slower than the other essays due to the mathematical content. The reader must absorb category theory definitions before they can follow the philosophical application. This is the collection's most demanding essay in terms of reader stamina.\n   111→\n   112→**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n   113→- **Three-register juggling** is the defining editorial challenge. Within a single section, the prose may move from \"$\\forall A \\in \\text{Obj}_\\mathcal{C}$\" to \"I can turn a cat into a mouse\" to \"the essence of Theseus's ship exists not in the physical world but in our minds.\" Each register must be internally consistent while the transitions feel natural.\n   114→- **\"Todo\" notes appear in the text** — two explicit \"Todo:\" blocks with rough notes and unfinished thoughts. These are FEATURES per B4 (working-draft quality). They must be preserved verbatim.\n   115→- **The magic book (魔法书) examples** are delightful narrative inventions that make abstract category theory intuitive. They have their own internal voice — whimsical, slightly self-mocking, with escalating complexity. The animal-transformation spells (\"猫猫变鼠鼠\" — \"kitty-kitty becomes mousey-mousey\") use playful reduplication that will be difficult to render in English without losing the charm or making it seem childish. This is a critical translation/editing challenge.\n   116→- **Mathematical notation** is extensive. LaTeX formulas appear inline and in display mode. These must be preserved exactly — they are not decorative but constitutive of the argument.\n   117→- **The concept of 境 (jing)** is formally introduced here for the first time in the collection. It is defined technically as a structure on P (phenomena). The Dictionary term must be respected absolutely (B1).\n   118→- **The \"dragon's blood\" (龙血) example** is a mini-narrative within the essay — a fantasy story used to illustrate meta-order. It has its own literary register. The author even includes a self-critical \"(to do: not a good example)\" note — again, a feature per B4.\n   119→- **Typos in the mathematical notation** (\"Bottoom-up\", \"Top-dowm\") should be preserved as-is in translation notes but flagged.\n   120→- **Philosophical terms from Essay 4** (第一实在, 第二实在, 形而上) recur here and must match across essays.\n   121→\n   122→**Register Shifts:** Mathematical-formal <-> narrative-playful <-> philosophical-reflective, cycling throughout. The most extreme register range in the collection. The transitions are often signaled by \"为了方便理解\" (for ease of understanding) before examples.\n   123→\n   124→**Experiential Observation:** The essay enacts its own thesis about structure and understanding. The reader builds understanding through the very process the essay describes — taking \"base objects\" (basic definitions), constructing morphisms (connections between them), and arriving at universal properties (the unified concept of jing). The magic book examples function as dreamscapes within the essay — environments in which abstract meaning becomes experientially real.\n   125→\n   126→---\n   127→\n   128→### Essay 7: 范畴论与境：K1策略 (Category Theory and Jing: K1 Strategy)\n   129→\n   130→**Register & Voice:** The most mathematically demanding essay in the collection. The author explicitly warns in the preface that this was \"written hastily to record ideas\" and \"has not been polished for reading experience.\" This is a maximally working-draft text (B4 applies absolutely). The register is predominantly mathematical-formal with philosophical interpretation, but the author periodically drops into surprisingly vivid concrete examples (the game walkthrough analogy, reading \"猫跳上了桌子\" / \"a cat jumped onto the table,\" a mother singing a child to sleep).\n   131→\n   132→**Pacing:** The essay moves in cycles of: mathematical definition -> philosophical interpretation -> concrete illustration. The pacing is uneven by the author's own admission (\"the reading rhythm is rather messy\"). This unevenness is a feature of the working-draft quality. The essay accelerates dramatically in the \"KA Conjecture\" section, which is entirely marked as \"Todo\" — a long, dense block of incomplete but brilliant ideas. The final \"写在最后\" (closing remarks) section shifts to a reflective, almost valedictory register.\n   133→\n   134→**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n   135→- **Mathematical density** is at its peak. Extended LaTeX derivations, commutative diagrams expressed in text, and multiple function compositions appear on nearly every page. These must be preserved precisely — they ARE the argument.\n   136→- **The extended \"Todo: KA猜想\" block** is a massive, unfinished section containing some of the collection's most ambitious ideas (tension, completion, children vs. adults, philosophical experimentation). It is explicitly unfinished and must remain so (B4). But it is also some of the most exciting prose in the entire collection — the ideas tumble out rapidly, and the writing has an urgency that finished prose often lacks.\n   137→- **The Matrix quote** — \"You have already made the choice. You are here to try to understand why and how you made it\" — appears in English within the Chinese text. This intertextual moment should be preserved exactly.\n   138→- **The meme example** (\"你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国\") is a Chinese internet meme used to illustrate incomprehension. It will need a translator's note; the editorial challenge is ensuring the note doesn't break the argument's flow (R6).\n   139→- **The \"1+1=2\" example** for natural transformation is a key pedagogical moment — the author describes the experience of mathematical understanding as a kind of \"alignment\" or \"confirmation feeling\" (eta). This passage must be experientially vivid in English.\n   140→- **Cross-essay references** are explicit: the essay directly references Essay 4 (后形而上学), Essay 5 (诗意), and Essay 6 (范畴论与境). It concludes by inviting the reader to re-read Essay 5 with the new framework. This recursive structure is deliberate.\n   141→- **Footnote 1** is a dense philosophical discussion of a priori cognitive structures, offering multiple possible interpretations — it functions almost as a mini-essay.\n   142→- **Hidden comment block** (marked with `%%`) contains mathematical observations about adjoint functors. This is authorial scratch-work that should be noted but may not appear in the published translation.\n   143→\n   144→**Register Shifts:** Mathematical-formal -> philosophical-interpretive -> concrete-illustrative -> working-draft/todo -> reflective-valedictory. The most varied pacing in the collection due to the unfinished nature of the text.\n   145→\n   146→**Experiential Observation:** The essay's most powerful moment is the closing passage, where the author suddenly zooms out from category theory to claim that \"poetry, literature, art, music, architecture, games, cooking, travel, memes\" are all performing the same process of constructing jing to evoke experience. The sudden widening of scope — from LaTeX to lullabies — is the collection's most breathtaking rhetorical move. The translation must deliver this crescendo.\n   147→\n   148→---\n   149→\n   150→### Essay 8: 关于诗意和境的一些零散想法 (Some Scattered Thoughts on the Poetic and Jing)\n   151→\n   152→**Register & Voice:** Deliberately fragmentary -- the title promises \"scattered thoughts\" and delivers exactly that. This is the collection's most explicitly informal text: short sections, aphoristic observations, draft fragments, bullet points, memes (including embedded images), and incomplete sentences. The voice is intimate and provisional -- the author is thinking in real time, bouncing between ideas. There is also a \"草稿\" (draft) section at the end that contains visibly unfinished writing, including incomplete sentences and code-switching between Chinese and English.\n   153→\n   154→**Pacing:** Non-linear and mosaic-like. Each section is self-contained, and they do not build on each other in sequence. The reader can almost read them in any order. This is structurally the opposite of Essays 4-7, which are carefully sequential. The scattered quality IS the essay's form.\n   155→\n   156→**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n   157→- The **opening passage on human finitude** is the collection's most lyrical moment. The analogy between human perceptual limits and artistic possibility (three-color display, twelve-tone equal temperament) is beautiful and philosophically precise. The rhetorical question must land with full force.\n   158→- The **coin-flip passage** is a brilliant micro-essay on the poetic. Must be crisp and simple.\n   159→- **Unfinished sentences and code-switching** appear in the draft section. Sentences stop mid-thought. Chinese and English mix mid-sentence. These are absolute B4 features.\n   160→- **Embedded memes** (images) are part of the essay's texture.\n   161→- The **Mengzi and Plato quotations** appear side by side -- a deliberately cross-cultural pairing.\n   162→- The **\"solved philosophical problems\" list** at the end is provocative and casual.\n   163→- The **long passage in \"关于范畴论\"** is the collection's emotional climax. A sustained defense of human creativity as jing-construction. The cumulative list rhetoric recalls Whitman. The final sentence about nothingness not being able to stop us is the collection's most stirring declaration and MUST be translated with full force.\n   164→\n   165→**Register Shifts:** Lyrical-poetic (opening) -> aphoristic (coin-flip, death) -> working-draft/fragmentary (草稿) -> passionate-declarative (category theory tools) -> scholarly-casual (solved problems list). Maximum register variety in minimum space.\n   166→\n   167→**Experiential Observation:** The essay's scattered form performs its thesis about jing-construction on a micro scale. Each short section is its own dreamscape. The cumulative effect is of a mind alive with connections, seeing jing everywhere. The essay's form IS the poetic.\n   168→\n   169→---\n   170→\n   171→### Index: 境集 (Jing Ji)\n   172→\n   173→**Structure:** The collection is divided into three parts with a deliberate architectural metaphor:\n   174→- **上集：鱼 (Part One: Fish)** -- Essays 1-3. Standalone essays, each addressing a specific philosophical puzzle. Can be read individually.\n   175→- **下集：渔 (Part Two: Fishing)** -- Essays 4-7. The systematic methodology. Interconnected, should be read as a unit. Explicitly marked as working drafts.\n   176→- **附录 (Appendix)** -- Essay 8. Scattered thoughts, read after everything else.\n   177→\n   178→**Editorial Significance of the Structure:**\n   179→- The Fish/Fishing division alludes to the proverb \"Give a man a fish / teach him to fish.\" Part One gives philosophical \"fish\" (specific answers); Part Two teaches the \"fishing\" (the method). This structural metaphor is load-bearing and must be preserved.\n   180→- The index explicitly notes Part Two essays are \"working drafts with many unfinished parts.\" This reinforces B4.\n   181→- Reading order is specified: sequential, despite being written at different times.\n   182→\n   183→---\n   184→\n   185→## Collection-Wide Editorial Observations\n   186→\n   187→**Voice Consistency:** The author's voice is remarkably consistent despite register range. The thinking-aloud quality, inclusive \"我们\" (we), willingness to leave things unfinished, and frequent connectives (\"事实上,\" \"也就是说\") create a recognizable authorial presence across all essays.\n   188→\n   189→**Progressive Density:** The collection moves from accessible (Essays 1-3) to increasingly dense (Essays 4-7) to deliberately fragmentary (Essay 8). This is a deliberate pedagogical arc.\n   190→\n   191→**Working-Draft Texture:** The entire collection, especially Part Two, retains explicit draft markers: todos, incomplete thoughts, self-corrections, typos. These are features per B4.\n   192→\n   193→**Five Registers Identified:**\n   194→1. Colloquial/thinking-aloud: Dominant in Essays 1, 3, parts of 8\n   195→2. Analytic: Dominant in Essay 2, sections of 4 and 7\n   196→3. Classical quotation: Laozi, Yijing, Mengzi, Plato -- in Essays 4, 6, 8\n   197→4. Mathematical/formal: Dominant in Essays 6-7\n   198→5. Near-lyrical: Essay 3 (cat), Essay 5 (dreamscape), Essay 8 (opening, tools passage)\n   199→\n   200→**Key Cross-Essay Consistency Requirements:**\n   201→- Terminology from Essay 4 (现象, 第一实在, 第二实在, 形而上, 恒常, 非理性) must be consistent across Essays 5-8\n   202→- 境 must be consistent from Essay 5 (梦境) through Essays 6-7 (formalized) to Essay 8\n   203→- 诗意 must be consistent from Essay 5 through Essay 8\n   204→- All dictionary terms must be checked against the Translation Dictionary\n   205→\n   206→---\n   207→\n   208→## Expert Report Notes\n   209→\n   210→Having read all 9 expert analysis reports, I extract the following editorially relevant insights:\n   211→\n   212→### The Essays as Philosophical Experiments (CRITICAL FOR EDITING)\n   213→\n   214→Multiple experts (Metaphysics, Phenomenology, Epistemology, Existentialism) independently identified that many passages in the essays function as **philosophical experiments conducted on the reader**. The experiential sequence is LOAD-BEARING, not merely illustrative. Key experimental passages:\n   215→\n   216→1. **The Sisyphus-to-cat gradient (Essay 3):** Three-stage descent from cosmic to domestic. The cat passage must NOT be condensed -- the accumulation of mundane detail IS the philosophical payload. The reader must *feel* the absence of absurdity, not just read about it.\n   217→\n   218→2. **The 道德仁义礼 reversal (Essay 4):** Methodical inversion of the standard hierarchy. The step-by-step quality induces a \"mini-epoche\" in the reader (phenomenology expert's term). Breaking this into disconnected points would destroy the experimental effect.\n   219→\n   220→3. **The 1+1=2 example (Essay 7):** Explicitly invites introspection on \"直接确认感\" (direct confirmatory feeling). Must be experientially vivid.\n   221→\n   222→4. **The three Bob examples (Essay 2):** Bob 3 (emotional reverie, no belief formed) is the experimental payload. The sprinkler in Bob 2 and the emotional absorption in Bob 3 are structurally necessary, not interchangeable.\n   223→\n   224→5. **The coin-flip passage (Essay 8):** Compact experiment. The reader who has done this recognizes it immediately. Must be crisp.\n   225→\n   226→**EDITORIAL IMPLICATION:** When editing translations of these passages, my R7 responsibility (flag experientially flat translations) is at maximum importance. If the translation is accurate but fails to reproduce the experiential sequence, the philosophical content is lost because the content IS the restructuring of the reader's 境.\n   227→\n   228→### Terminology Consensus Across Experts\n   229→\n   230→The experts broadly converge on the following renderings (to be checked against the Dictionary):\n   231→- 境: Transliterate as \"Jing\" with gloss (unanimous)\n   232→- 现象: \"phenomena\" (unanimous, with note on phenomenological weight)\n   233→- 第一实在 / 第二实在 / 第〇实在: \"First Reality\" / \"Second Reality\" / \"Zeroth Reality\" (near-unanimous)\n   234→- 恒常: \"constancy\" (metaphysics expert), NOT \"permanence\" or \"invariance\"\n   235→- 非理性: \"the non-rational\" (NOT \"irrational\" -- this distinction is load-bearing)\n   236→- 诗意: \"the poetic\" (near-unanimous; NOT \"poetry\" or \"poetic meaning\")\n   237→- 梦境: \"dreamscape\" (unanimous)\n   238→- 沉醉的/清醒的梦境: \"intoxicated/lucid dreamscape\" (unanimous)\n   239→- 形而上 vs 形而上学: \"the metaphysical\" vs \"metaphysics\" (consistent across experts)\n   240→- 联想: \"association\" (unanimous, with phenomenological weight noted)\n   241→- 泛性质/范性质: \"universal property\" (standard mathematical term)\n   242→\n   243→### Register and Pacing Warnings from Experts\n   244→\n   245→- **Phenomenology expert:** The two types of 感受 (received stimulation vs. crystallization/surge/turbulence) in Essay 5 are a philosophically precise distinction. The translation must preserve this.\n   246→- **Existentialism expert:** 诗意 is NOT aesthetic ornamentation but an entire existential stance. If translated as just \"poetic meaning,\" it loses its weight. Must be \"the poetic\" -- functioning like Heidegger's \"das Dichterische.\"\n   247→- **Chinese philosophy expert:** The Laozi passage in Essay 4 is NOT being interpreted as Laozi scholarship. The author is using the structure as an illustration. The translation must make this distinction clear.\n   248→- **Buddhism expert:** 境 has deep resonances with Buddhist 境界 (visaya, gocara, ayatana) that inform the term's registers. The translator should be aware of these resonances without over-explicating them.\n   249→- **Wittgenstein expert:** The author's use of \"language games\" is a productive but reoriented extension of Wittgenstein. The translation should not assimilate it to standard Wittgensteinian usage without noting the author's modifications.\n   250→\n   251→### Intersubjectivity via eta (Multiple Experts)\n   252→\n   253→Multiple experts (metaphysics, phenomenology, epistemology, existentialism) independently flagged the natural transformation eta as providing a structural account of intersubjectivity. The key insight: two people \"understand\" the same thing when their respective eta have the same structural form, without needing shared qualia. This is philosophically significant and should be clearly conveyed in translation.\n   254→\n   255→### The Closing Passage of Essay 7 / Essay 8\n   256→\n   257→The existentialism and phenomenology experts both identify the closing passage of K1策略 (from poetry through memes to lullabies) and the long passage in Essay 8 about tools and jing-construction as the collection's emotional and philosophical climax. These passages must be translated with maximum force. They represent the moment where the formal apparatus connects to lived human experience.\n   258→\n   259→---\n   260→\n   261→## Dictionary Notes\n   262→\n   263→Having read the Translation Dictionary in full, I extract the following editorially relevant observations:\n   264→\n   265→### Terms That Will Be Editorially Challenging in Running Prose\n   266→\n   267→1. **\"the metaphysical\" (形而上) as a count noun** -- \"a metaphysical\" sounds unusual in English. The dictionary permits \"a metaphysical construct\" as alternative. I need to watch for contexts where the bare \"a metaphysical\" reads awkwardly and flag for the translator.\n   268→\n   269→2. **\"(constitutive) character\" for 德** -- This is a creative solution but the parenthetical will feel heavy in repeated use. After first occurrence, \"character\" alone should flow naturally. The SPLIT convention (virtue in block quotes, character in analysis) requires careful editorial tracking.\n   270→\n   271→3. **\"phenomenal ritual conduct / phenomenal humaneness / phenomenal rightness\"** -- These are 6-8 syllable compound terms that will create dense, heavy sentences. The \"phenomenal X\" prefix MUST be preserved per B9 (intentional repetition), but I should flag sentences where the accumulation becomes unreadable.\n   272→\n   273→4. **\"feeling\" for 感受** -- The everyday English word \"feeling\" carrying this much philosophical weight will sometimes read too casual. The \"felt experience\" variant is available for technical contexts, but the trigger criterion (\"Is it naming a type of thing or describing what someone feels?\") requires editorial judgment case by case.\n   274→\n   275→5. **\"the poetic\" for 诗意** -- This works as a substantive but will be awkward in some syntactic positions. \"Poetic stance\" and \"poetic mode\" are available variants. Capitalization convention (capitalized on first occurrence per essay, lowercase thereafter) needs tracking.\n   276→\n   277→6. **\"Jing\" (romanized) for 境** -- A transliterated term in running English prose always risks feeling alien. The -scape echo system (dreamscape = dream + 境) helps ground it. The first-occurrence apparatus (glossary note, -scape footnote) must be positioned to not break reading flow (R6).\n   278→\n   279→### Glossing Conventions to Enforce\n   280→\n   281→- **First occurrence per essay**: \"English (漢字, *pinyin*)\" format for key terms\n   282→- **-scape echo footnote**: Must appear at first introduction of Jing, explaining the morphological link\n   283→- **Translator's notes (TNs)**: Required for 感受, 前形而上学, 境界 (at line 25 only), 沉醉, 德, and 范畴论. Must verify these don't break experiential momentum (R6)\n   284→- **Block quote convention for Laozi**: Original 文言 in block quote with full English rendering, attribution \"adapted from Ivanhoe (2003)\"\n   285→\n   286→### Formatting/Consistency Concerns\n   287→\n   288→- **Capitalization system**: First Reality / Second Reality / Zeroth Reality -- always capitalized as technical terms. \"The Poetic\" capitalized in glossary/titles, lowercase in running text after first mention per essay. \"Jing\" always capitalized.\n   289→- **Mathematical notation**: Must be preserved exactly. All LaTeX formulas, Fraktur script for full P, calligraphic E for subcategories.\n   290→- **Italic/bold system from Essay 4**: Italics mark special terms, bold marks emphasis. This is the author's notational system and must be preserved per B5.\n   291→- **The \"phenomenal X\" prefix system**: Must be consistent across all occurrences (现象礼, 现象仁, 现象义) -- never drop the prefix.\n   292→- **NEVER translate 虚无 as \"emptiness\"** -- reserved for Buddhist 空/sunyata. Non-negotiable.\n   293→- **NEVER translate 非理性 as \"irrational\"** -- must be \"the non-rational.\" Load-bearing distinction.\n   294→\n   295→### Cross-Essay Term Tracking Checklist\n   296→\n   297→The following terms appear across multiple essays and must be tracked for consistency:\n   298→- 现象/phenomena (Essays 1-8)\n   299→- 第一/二/〇实在 (Essays 4-8)\n   300→- 形而上/the metaphysical (Essays 4-8)\n   301→- 恒常/constancy (Essays 4, 6, 7, 8)\n   302→- 境/Jing (Essays 5-8)\n   303→- 诗意/the poetic (Essays 5, 7, 8)\n   304→- 梦境/dreamscape (Essays 5, 8)\n   305→- 非理性/the non-rational (Essays 4, 6, 7)\n   306→- 感受/feeling (all essays)\n   307→- 联想/association (Essays 6, 7)\n   308→- 泛性质/universal property (Essays 6, 7)\n   309→\n   310→---\n   311→\n   312→## Translator's Memo Notes (editorial extraction)\n   313→\n   314→Read the translator's full memo at `/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Memo.md`. Below are the editorially relevant items I need to track.\n   315→\n   316→### Translation Approach Decisions That Affect Editing\n   317→\n   318→1. **Title format**: \"**Jing Ji** (境集) / *Collected Essays on Jing*\" — the romanized title with subtitle. As editor I need to ensure this format is consistent wherever the title appears.\n   319→\n   320→2. **First-occurrence glossing protocol**: Key terms get \"English (漢字, *pinyin*)\" on first occurrence per essay. This means I will see these glosses repeatedly across essays. I need to verify: (a) the gloss appears on the FIRST occurrence and not later, (b) the format is consistent, (c) after the first occurrence the gloss is dropped and plain English used.\n   321→\n   322→3. **Classical Chinese quotation format**: Original 文言 in block quote, followed by glossed English rendering. The 文言/modern boundary must be visible through formatting (block-indent vs. running text). I need to enforce this formatting distinction consistently.\n   323→\n   324→4. **\"Phenomenal X\" compounds NEVER drop the prefix** — even when repetitive, even when heavy. This is now a hard rule from both the translator and the Dictionary. My job is to manage density around these terms, not to abbreviate them.\n   325→\n   326→5. **Re-glossing at register transitions**: When a term (e.g., 仁) shifts from classical quotation context to the author's modern analysis, a brief \"(仁)\" reminder is added. I need to check these appear at the right moments — not too often (cluttering), not too rarely (losing the reader).\n   327→\n   328→6. **德 SPLIT convention**: \"Virtue\" in the Laozi block quote rendering, \"(constitutive) character\" in the author's analysis. This is a deliberate terminological shift within a single passage. I need to verify the TN explaining this shift is properly placed and visible.\n   329→\n   330→### Resolved Questions That Affect Editing\n   331→\n   332→7. **Q1 — 诗意 capitalization**: \"The Poetic\" (capitalized) as substantive on first occurrence per essay, lowercase \"poetic\" as adjective thereafter. I need to track this across all essays where it appears (5, 7, 8).\n   333→\n   334→8. **Q3 — Essay 2 untouched**: The translator will NOT edit the author's native English. Three translator's footnotes will be added connecting author's informal terms to formal counterparts. I need to ensure these footnotes are editorially integrated without breaking the essay's own voice (B6 applies).\n   335→\n   336→9. **Q5 — Meme sentence replacement**: The Chinese internet meme in K1 will be replaced with an English grammatically-plausible-but-semantically-void sentence, NOT literally translated. A translator's note cites the original Chinese. This is an unusual editorial situation — I need to verify the replacement sentence achieves the right effect (natively incomprehensible in English, not \"bad translation\" feeling).\n   337→\n   338→10. **Q6 — 虚妄 = \"vain presumption\"**: Author's personal coinage, NOT Buddhist usage. Footnote disambiguates. I need to verify this footnote is present and clear.\n   339→\n   340→11. **Q7 — 形 = 现象 reinterpretation note**: Half-page in Translator's Introduction + footnote at first occurrence in Essay 4. This is the same TN2 I already reviewed in the DaoDeRenYiLi draft. Confirmed: it is well-placed and clear.\n   341→\n   342→### Glossary as Editorial Reference\n   343→\n   344→The translator's core glossary table (Section 2 of the Translation Approach) contains 40+ terms with their agreed English renderings. This is my primary reference for B1 (never alter terminology from the Dictionary). Key items I will check most frequently:\n   345→\n   346→- 境 = Jing / E (technical)\n   347→- 形而上 = the metaphysical (NOT \"metaphysics\")\n   348→- 形而上学 = metaphysics (NOT \"the metaphysical\")\n   349→- 非理性 = the non-rational (NOT \"irrational\")\n   350→- 恒常 = constancy (NOT \"permanence\" / \"regularity\" / \"invariance\")\n   351→- 虚无 = the void / nothingness (NEVER \"emptiness\")\n   352→- 感受 = feeling / felt experience (context-dependent)\n   353→- 德 = De / character (NEVER \"virtue\" outside the Laozi block quote)\n   354→\n   355→### Register Strategy Alignment\n   356→\n   357→The translator identifies the same 5 registers I identified independently. Good — we are aligned. The translator's notes add one important detail: Essay 2's register (analytic philosophy) serves as the **register standard** for the analytic passages. This means when I edit analytic passages in translated essays, I should check them against Essay 2's natural voice for calibration.\n   358→\n   359→### Reference Translations\n   360→\n   361→The translator has collected three standard English translations of the Laozi Ch. 38 passage (Ivanhoe, Lau, Wing-tsit Chan). TN1 in the draft cites Ivanhoe and explains departures. I verified this in my review — it is well-done. For any future classical Chinese passages, I should check whether reference translations have been similarly collected and cited.\n   362→\n   363→### Structural Principles — My Enforcement Checklist\n   364→\n   365→The translator lists 5 structural principles. These map directly to my hard boundaries:\n   366→\n   367→| Translator's Principle | My Boundary |\n   368→|------------------------|-------------|\n   369→| Preserve experiential sequences exactly | B2 (never restructure/reorder) |\n   370→| Preserve working-draft quality | B4 (never polish away drafts) |\n   371→| Preserve bilingual nature | B6 (never harmonize Essay 2) |\n   372→| Preserve fish/fishing structure | B2 (never restructure) |\n   373→| Footnotes are philosophically essential | R6 (verify footnote integration) |\n   374→\n   375→This alignment is reassuring — the translator and I are working from the same constraints.\n   376→\n   377→---\n   378→\n   379→## Expert Questions\n   380→\n   381→### Q1: \"Phenomenal X\" density management in English prose\n   382→\n   383→**Problem:** The author's coined compounds 现象礼, 现象仁, 现象义 are 3 syllables each in Chinese. Their English equivalents — \"phenomenal ritual conduct\" (8 syllables), \"phenomenal humaneness\" (7 syllables), \"phenomenal rightness\" (6 syllables) — are dramatically heavier. In the long analytical paragraphs of Essay 4, these terms accumulate 5-6 times per sentence. The Dictionary and B9 require preserving the \"phenomenal\" prefix always. But the resulting English is borderline unreadable in places.\n   384→\n   385→**Question for Chinese philosophy expert:** In the original Chinese, does the repetition of 现象X create any sense of heaviness or accumulation for a native Chinese reader, or does the 3-character compactness make it feel natural and light? I need to understand whether density management in English should aim for \"transparent/invisible\" (matching the Chinese reader's experience) or \"deliberately weighty\" (if the Chinese reader also feels the terms accumulating).\n   386→\n   387→**Status:** RESOLVED — Answer: both light individually AND dense cumulatively. Hybrid strategy: keep all repetition, manage density through sentence architecture, shape as crescendo toward reversal. See Q1 file for full response.\n   388→\n   389→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

The essay opens casually (\"今天有一些...想法\" — \"Today I had some thoughts about...\") and maintains a discursive, exploratory tone. The author reasons through a problem in real time, with self-corrections (\"然而仔细一想\" — \"but on closer thought\") and hedges (\"似乎\" — \"it seems\"). This working-draft quality is structural (B4 applies: do not polish away).\n\n**Pacing:** The argument moves in a clear dialectical rhythm: (1) initial claim (collective interest doesn't exist), (2) reversal via renormalization analogy, (3) examples (ocean/molecules), (4) deeper consequence about human individuality and empathy, (5) law as mediating between scales, (6) coda on abstraction itself. The pacing is unhurried and deliberate — each step builds on the last. The translation must preserve this patient unfolding.\n\n**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n- The **renormalization (重整化)** analogy is the essay's load-bearing metaphor. It recurs throughout and connects to technical physics concepts. The translator will need to keep it consistent and accessible without dumbing it down. Dictionary term must be respected.\n- **Nested parenthetical qualifications** are characteristic — e.g., \"人类群体（作为一个整体）\" — these create a thinking-aloud texture. In English, excessive parentheticals can feel labored; we need to preserve the qualifier texture without making sentences unreadable.\n- **Bold emphasis** is used sparingly but structurally: \"**在宏观层面上，群体能否被当作一个整体来认知**\" and \"**只有**...才能\". These must carry over exactly (B5).\n- **Footnotes** are substantive and philosophical, not merely bibliographic. Footnote 2 is a full paragraph of argumentation. The footnotes are part of the essay's experiential fabric — they read like asides in the author's thinking process (R6: verify footnote integration doesn't break momentum).\n\n**Register Shifts:** Minimal. The essay stays in the thinking-aloud register almost throughout, with slight elevation when making the renormalization analogy more formal. The FAQ callout box introduces a question-to-self quality.\n\n**Experiential Observation:** The essay performs the very thing it describes — it starts from the individual's perspective and tries to reason outward to the collective, demonstrating the limitation it articulates. The translation must preserve this performative dimension.\n\n---\n\n### Essay 2: A Thought on Knowledge\n\n**Register & Voice:** This essay is NATIVELY WRITTEN IN ENGLISH (B6 applies: do NOT harmonize with translated essays). The register is analytic-academic but with a distinct informal undercurrent — the author repeatedly uses first-person perspective (\"my confusion,\" \"my take\") and colloquial phrasing (\"knowledge is just... belief?\"). The ellipsis with question mark is a signature rhetorical move — the author arrives at a conclusion that surprises even themselves.\n\n**Pacing:** The essay follows a methodical, almost pedagogical structure: define terms, propose an example (\"It is raining outside\"), analyze each component of JTB in sequence, arrive at a disruptive conclusion. The pacing is patient and systematic — each step is laid out before the next. The three Bob/Alice examples (rain scenarios) are a key experiential sequence: the third example (#3) deliberately breaks from epistemological analysis into something almost lyrical (\"His thoughts flowed among the changes of light reflected by the water\"). This register shift from analytic to near-lyrical is load-bearing — it demonstrates how phenomena can be experienced without being converted to propositional knowledge.\n\n**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n- The prose has some rough edges that are FEATURES, not bugs: slightly awkward constructions (\"my take to it\"), occasional verbosity, and a working-draft conversational quality. B4 demands these be preserved. However, there are also genuine infelicities that may need flagging — distinguishing these from intentional roughness is the central editorial challenge.\n- The **Sidenotes section** is extensive and functions as a secondary essay. Its tone is slightly more formal-pedagogical than the main text. The sidenotes on high-energy physics and mathematics are substantial intellectual arguments, not mere clarifications.\n- The \"circular justified beliefs\" sidenote escalates into a reductio ad absurdum about babies having knowledge, before-lives, and \"a glitch in video games\" — this is a deliberately playful-absurdist register within an otherwise analytic essay. Do not flatten this tonal shift.\n- The acknowledgment \"I would like to thank Claude for drafting the abstract\" is a notable meta-textual moment.\n\n**Register Shifts:** Analytic -> near-lyrical (Bob scenario #3) -> back to analytic -> playful-absurdist (circular justification sidenote). These shifts are all deliberate and must be preserved.\n\n**Experiential Observation:** The essay's structure mirrors its thesis — it proceeds by belief, checking, and revision, performing the epistemic process it analyzes. The reader experiences the same progression from confidence to uncertainty that the essay describes.\n\n---\n\n### Essay 3: 西西弗斯、班与猫 (Sisyphus, Work, and Cats)\n\n**Register & Voice:** Conversational-philosophical, more personal and narrative-driven than Essay 1. The essay opens with a personal anecdote (\"About a year ago, I discussed absurdism with a friend\") and maintains a warm, exploratory tone. The voice is that of someone thinking through a puzzle, arriving at insight through concrete examples rather than abstract argument. The author's personality shines through more strongly here — there is humor, directness, and a kind of affectionate irreverence toward grand philosophical problems.\n\n**Pacing:** The essay has a masterful three-act structure with escalating concreteness:\n1. Sisyphus (mythological/abstract) -> 2. The office worker (modern/relatable) -> 3. The cat owner (intimate/domestic). Each example is *less* dramatic than the last, and this de-escalation IS the philosophical argument: absurdity dissolves as we move from \"cosmic\" to \"everyday.\" The pacing mirrors the thesis — the essay itself becomes less tense, more relaxed, more at home as it progresses. This is load-bearing pacing (S3 applies strongly).\n\n**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n- The **interrupted thought** at the end of the office worker section: \"而上述例子中的人则还尚未——\" (and the person in this example has not yet--). The em dash trailing off is a dramatic rhetorical device, immediately followed by \"但是等一等\" (but wait a moment). This interruption-and-pivot is performative: the reader is meant to feel the turn. Translation must capture this exact rhythm.\n- The **cat passage** is the essay's climax precisely because it is anticlimactic. The prose becomes warmer, more specific (waking up to meowing, cleaning cat hair, scratched furniture), and the conclusion is deliberately simple: \"just because we want to keep a cat, because we like life with a cat, and that is all.\" The simplicity is the point. The English must resist any urge to elevate or ornament — plainness here is the philosophical payoff.\n- **Alienation (异化)** appears as a technical philosophical term within an otherwise casual passage — this register mixing is intentional.\n- The **parenthetical English** \"(off-tone)\" appears in the original Chinese text — an interesting bilingual moment that should be preserved and noted.\n- **Repetition of \"事实上\" (in fact / actually)** throughout — this is characteristic of the author's thinking-aloud style and must be preserved (B9 on intentional repetition).\n\n**Register Shifts:** The essay moves between narrative, philosophical analysis, and intimate-domestic description. The transitions are smooth — there are no jarring gear shifts. The most significant shift is the tonal de-escalation across the three examples.\n\n**Experiential Observation:** The essay performs its own thesis: the reader's experience moves from abstract philosophical puzzlement (Sisyphus) to recognition (the office worker) to warm, familiar comfort (the cat). By the end, absurdity has dissolved for the reader too. The translation must reproduce this experiential arc.\n\n---\n\n### Essay 4: 后形而上学 整理 (Post-Metaphysics, Organized)\n\n**Register & Voice:** This is the most formally structured essay so far. The register is analytic-expository with a systematic, textbook-like quality: numbered categories (第〇种, 第一种, 第二种, 第三种 metaphysics), defined terminology (italicized special terms), and explicit footnotes that function as scholarly apparatus. Yet the voice remains personal — the author says \"I created this term,\" uses \"we\" inclusively, and includes hedges (\"似乎\"). The meta-textual preface openly acknowledges this is an \"organized\" version of an earlier draft, and that terms differ from philosophical tradition — this working-draft transparency is a feature (B4).\n\n**Pacing:** The essay moves in a careful building-block progression: (1) define \"pre-metaphysics\" and phenomena as \"first reality,\" (2) elaborate via Laozi's hierarchy (dao-de-ren-yi-li), (3) show the reversal of generative direction, (4) classify four types of metaphysical understanding (Types 0-3), (5) discuss the \"objective world\" as model, (6) address nihilism and irrationality, (7) arrive at post-metaphysics. The pacing is deliberately pedagogical — each concept must be digested before the next arrives. The essay does NOT rush; it trusts the reader to follow layer by layer.\n\n**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n- **Italic/bold formatting is SYSTEMATIC and load-bearing.** Italics mark defined/special terms (现象, 恒常, 第一实在, 第二实在, etc.). Bold marks emphasis and key claims. This is not decoration — it is the essay's notational system. The translation must preserve every instance exactly (B5). This will be one of the most format-intensive essays to edit.\n- **The Laozi passage and its analysis** is the essay's most challenging section. The author takes 道-德-仁-义-礼 and re-reads them phenomenologically, inventing terms like \"phenomenal-li (现象礼),\" \"phenomenal-ren (现象仁),\" \"phenomenal-yi (现象义).\" The translation must handle these hybrid terms carefully — they are the author's own coinages, not standard philosophical vocabulary. Dictionary conventions must be checked.\n- **\"第〇实在\" / \"第一实在\" / \"第二实在\"** (Zeroth Reality, First Reality, Second Reality) — the numbering system is non-standard and philosophically significant. The ordinals carry meaning (zero = what would be \"below\" phenomena, first = phenomena themselves, second = constructs above phenomena).\n- **Footnotes are EXTENSIVE (16 footnotes)** and range from brief clarifications to substantial philosophical arguments. Footnote 1 is a meta-textual formatting guide. Footnotes 3 and 6 are paragraph-length explanations. These need careful integration (R6).\n- **The section on irrationality (非理性)** introduces a new register — more urgent, almost confessional. The claim that the pursuit of metaphysics is itself irrational, and that this irrationality must be \"acknowledged,\" has existential weight.\n- **Classical Chinese quotations** (Laozi, Yijing) appear embedded in the argument, not as decorative epigraphs. Their translation must be functional within the argument, not just elegant.\n\n**Register Shifts:** Expository-analytic throughout, but with notable shifts: (a) the Laozi analysis section becomes more intricate and recursive; (b) the nihilism/irrationality section becomes more urgent and existential; (c) the closing paragraphs on post-metaphysics become almost programmatic/declarative.\n\n**Experiential Observation:** The essay enacts the very process it describes — it builds up a metaphysical framework (types 0-3), only to show that all such frameworks are constructions from phenomena. The reader constructs the understanding that understanding is construction. The circularity is deliberate and performative.\n\n---\n\n### Essay 5: 形而上学后的目的：诗意 (The Purpose After Metaphysics: The Poetic)\n\n**Register & Voice:** The register shifts significantly from Essay 4's systematic exposition to something more lyrical and existentially urgent. The opening paragraph recapitulates Essay 4's conclusion about irrationality, then pivots: \"But meaning and purpose are not nonexistent things — in fact, we live within meaning every day.\" This pivot signals a change in emotional temperature. The essay's voice becomes more intimate, more searching. The key term \"梦境\" (dreamscape) is introduced with the author openly admitting they cannot find a precise name for it — this vulnerability is structural.\n\n**Pacing:** Shorter and more concentrated than Essay 4. Two main movements: (1) the concept of \"dreamscape\" as the environment in which meaning arises, (2) the distinction between intoxicated and lucid dreamscapes. The pacing accelerates toward the conclusion — the final paragraph is dense, almost aphoristic, and the last sentence (\"如此便是清醒的梦境，是谓之诗意也\" — \"This is the lucid dreamscape, and this is what is called the poetic\") has the weight of a philosophical declaration.\n\n**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n- **\"梦境\" (dreamscape/dream-realm)** is the central concept. The author explicitly lists alternative words they considered: \"game, book, adventure, small world, small freedom, etc.\" This naming hesitancy is part of the essay's texture — the concept resists precise naming. The dictionary term must be used, but the surrounding list of alternatives must also be preserved.\n- **\"诗意\" (the poetic/poetic quality)** is the essay's destination. This term carries enormous weight in the collection. Its translation must be both philosophically precise and experientially resonant. It is NOT \"poetry\" but something like \"poetic-ness\" or \"the quality of being poetic.\"\n- The **bold/italic formatting system** continues from Essay 4 — italics for special terms, bold for emphasis. The passage \"我们**必须**拥抱一些梦境\" (we **must** embrace certain dreamscapes) uses bold for existential urgency, not mere logical emphasis.\n- **Three-part metaphor chain**: \"感性的涌动、体验的结晶、情绪的湍流\" (the surge of sensibility, the crystallization of experience, the turbulence of emotion) — this near-lyrical sequence within an analytical essay is a crucial register shift. The translation must preserve both the rhythm and the specific imagery (surge, crystallization, turbulence).\n- **The intoxicated vs. lucid dreamscape distinction** is the essay's philosophical payload. The examples of \"lucid\" — \"playing a game while knowing it is a game; reading a novel while knowing it is a novel; burning joss paper to express grief; holding a ceremony to show importance\" — move from the modern-casual to the culturally specific. The translation must handle these examples without over-explaining.\n- **Footnote 2** introduces a distinction between two kinds of \"feeling\" (受到之感觉 vs. the \"crystallization/surge/turbulence\") that is philosophically precise and terminologically important.\n- **Footnote 3** is personally revealing — the author defines their own idiosyncratic usage of \"虚妄\" dating back to middle school. This personal etymology is a feature (B4).\n\n**Register Shifts:** Analytic-recapitulative (opening) -> naming-hesitant/exploratory (dreamscape section) -> near-lyrical (the \"surge/crystallization/turbulence\" passage) -> urgent-existential (the \"you cannot abandon all dreamscapes\" passage) -> declarative-aphoristic (conclusion).\n\n**Experiential Observation:** The essay IS a dreamscape about dreamscapes. The reader enters the concept through the game analogy, experiences the naming difficulty, feels the existential urgency of the \"you cannot escape\" passage, and arrives at \"the poetic\" as both a philosophical concept and an experiential destination. The conclusion performs what it names.\n\n---\n\n### Essay 6: 范畴论与境 整理 (Category Theory and Jing, Organized)\n\n**Register & Voice:** The most technically dense essay in the collection. The register oscillates between three distinct modes: (a) mathematical/formal (category theory definitions with LaTeX notation), (b) narrative-playful (the \"magic book\" examples), and (c) philosophical-reflective (the sections on metaphysics, P, E, and jing). The voice remains personal even in the most technical passages — \"I\" is always present, and the magic book examples are written with genuine narrative charm (the professor \"slacking off\" while writing spellbooks). The essay's preface openly marks it as an organized draft with unfinished portions removed.\n\n**Pacing:** The essay has a pedagogical architecture: formal definition -> illustrative example -> philosophical interpretation, repeated in cycles. The pacing is necessarily slower than the other essays due to the mathematical content. The reader must absorb category theory definitions before they can follow the philosophical application. This is the collection's most demanding essay in terms of reader stamina.\n\n**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n- **Three-register juggling** is the defining editorial challenge. Within a single section, the prose may move from \"$\\forall A \\in \\text{Obj}_\\mathcal{C}$\" to \"I can turn a cat into a mouse\" to \"the essence of Theseus's ship exists not in the physical world but in our minds.\" Each register must be internally consistent while the transitions feel natural.\n- **\"Todo\" notes appear in the text** — two explicit \"Todo:\" blocks with rough notes and unfinished thoughts. These are FEATURES per B4 (working-draft quality). They must be preserved verbatim.\n- **The magic book (魔法书) examples** are delightful narrative inventions that make abstract category theory intuitive. They have their own internal voice — whimsical, slightly self-mocking, with escalating complexity. The animal-transformation spells (\"猫猫变鼠鼠\" — \"kitty-kitty becomes mousey-mousey\") use playful reduplication that will be difficult to render in English without losing the charm or making it seem childish. This is a critical translation/editing challenge.\n- **Mathematical notation** is extensive. LaTeX formulas appear inline and in display mode. These must be preserved exactly — they are not decorative but constitutive of the argument.\n- **The concept of 境 (jing)** is formally introduced here for the first time in the collection. It is defined technically as a structure on P (phenomena). The Dictionary term must be respected absolutely (B1).\n- **The \"dragon's blood\" (龙血) example** is a mini-narrative within the essay — a fantasy story used to illustrate meta-order. It has its own literary register. The author even includes a self-critical \"(to do: not a good example)\" note — again, a feature per B4.\n- **Typos in the mathematical notation** (\"Bottoom-up\", \"Top-dowm\") should be preserved as-is in translation notes but flagged.\n- **Philosophical terms from Essay 4** (第一实在, 第二实在, 形而上) recur here and must match across essays.\n\n**Register Shifts:** Mathematical-formal <-> narrative-playful <-> philosophical-reflective, cycling throughout. The most extreme register range in the collection. The transitions are often signaled by \"为了方便理解\" (for ease of understanding) before examples.\n\n**Experiential Observation:** The essay enacts its own thesis about structure and understanding. The reader builds understanding through the very process the essay describes — taking \"base objects\" (basic definitions), constructing morphisms (connections between them), and arriving at universal properties (the unified concept of jing). The magic book examples function as dreamscapes within the essay — environments in which abstract meaning becomes experientially real.\n\n---\n\n### Essay 7: 范畴论与境：K1策略 (Category Theory and Jing: K1 Strategy)\n\n**Register & Voice:** The most mathematically demanding essay in the collection. The author explicitly warns in the preface that this was \"written hastily to record ideas\" and \"has not been polished for reading experience.\" This is a maximally working-draft text (B4 applies absolutely). The register is predominantly mathematical-formal with philosophical interpretation, but the author periodically drops into surprisingly vivid concrete examples (the game walkthrough analogy, reading \"猫跳上了桌子\" / \"a cat jumped onto the table,\" a mother singing a child to sleep).\n\n**Pacing:** The essay moves in cycles of: mathematical definition -> philosophical interpretation -> concrete illustration. The pacing is uneven by the author's own admission (\"the reading rhythm is rather messy\"). This unevenness is a feature of the working-draft quality. The essay accelerates dramatically in the \"KA Conjecture\" section, which is entirely marked as \"Todo\" — a long, dense block of incomplete but brilliant ideas. The final \"写在最后\" (closing remarks) section shifts to a reflective, almost valedictory register.\n\n**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n- **Mathematical density** is at its peak. Extended LaTeX derivations, commutative diagrams expressed in text, and multiple function compositions appear on nearly every page. These must be preserved precisely — they ARE the argument.\n- **The extended \"Todo: KA猜想\" block** is a massive, unfinished section containing some of the collection's most ambitious ideas (tension, completion, children vs. adults, philosophical experimentation). It is explicitly unfinished and must remain so (B4). But it is also some of the most exciting prose in the entire collection — the ideas tumble out rapidly, and the writing has an urgency that finished prose often lacks.\n- **The Matrix quote** — \"You have already made the choice. You are here to try to understand why and how you made it\" — appears in English within the Chinese text. This intertextual moment should be preserved exactly.\n- **The meme example** (\"你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国\") is a Chinese internet meme used to illustrate incomprehension. It will need a translator's note; the editorial challenge is ensuring the note doesn't break the argument's flow (R6).\n- **The \"1+1=2\" example** for natural transformation is a key pedagogical moment — the author describes the experience of mathematical understanding as a kind of \"alignment\" or \"confirmation feeling\" (eta). This passage must be experientially vivid in English.\n- **Cross-essay references** are explicit: the essay directly references Essay 4 (后形而上学), Essay 5 (诗意), and Essay 6 (范畴论与境). It concludes by inviting the reader to re-read Essay 5 with the new framework. This recursive structure is deliberate.\n- **Footnote 1** is a dense philosophical discussion of a priori cognitive structures, offering multiple possible interpretations — it functions almost as a mini-essay.\n- **Hidden comment block** (marked with `%%`) contains mathematical observations about adjoint functors. This is authorial scratch-work that should be noted but may not appear in the published translation.\n\n**Register Shifts:** Mathematical-formal -> philosophical-interpretive -> concrete-illustrative -> working-draft/todo -> reflective-valedictory. The most varied pacing in the collection due to the unfinished nature of the text.\n\n**Experiential Observation:** The essay's most powerful moment is the closing passage, where the author suddenly zooms out from category theory to claim that \"poetry, literature, art, music, architecture, games, cooking, travel, memes\" are all performing the same process of constructing jing to evoke experience. The sudden widening of scope — from LaTeX to lullabies — is the collection's most breathtaking rhetorical move. The translation must deliver this crescendo.\n\n---\n\n### Essay 8: 关于诗意和境的一些零散想法 (Some Scattered Thoughts on the Poetic and Jing)\n\n**Register & Voice:** Deliberately fragmentary -- the title promises \"scattered thoughts\" and delivers exactly that. This is the collection's most explicitly informal text: short sections, aphoristic observations, draft fragments, bullet points, memes (including embedded images), and incomplete sentences. The voice is intimate and provisional -- the author is thinking in real time, bouncing between ideas. There is also a \"草稿\" (draft) section at the end that contains visibly unfinished writing, including incomplete sentences and code-switching between Chinese and English.\n\n**Pacing:** Non-linear and mosaic-like. Each section is self-contained, and they do not build on each other in sequence. The reader can almost read them in any order. This is structurally the opposite of Essays 4-7, which are carefully sequential. The scattered quality IS the essay's form.\n\n**Key Editorial Challenges:**\n- The **opening passage on human finitude** is the collection's most lyrical moment. The analogy between human perceptual limits and artistic possibility (three-color display, twelve-tone equal temperament) is beautiful and philosophically precise. The rhetorical question must land with full force.\n- The **coin-flip passage** is a brilliant micro-essay on the poetic. Must be crisp and simple.\n- **Unfinished sentences and code-switching** appear in the draft section. Sentences stop mid-thought. Chinese and English mix mid-sentence. These are absolute B4 features.\n- **Embedded memes** (images) are part of the essay's texture.\n- The **Mengzi and Plato quotations** appear side by side -- a deliberately cross-cultural pairing.\n- The **\"solved philosophical problems\" list** at the end is provocative and casual.\n- The **long passage in \"关于范畴论\"** is the collection's emotional climax. A sustained defense of human creativity as jing-construction. The cumulative list rhetoric recalls Whitman. The final sentence about nothingness not being able to stop us is the collection's most stirring declaration and MUST be translated with full force.\n\n**Register Shifts:** Lyrical-poetic (opening) -> aphoristic (coin-flip, death) -> working-draft/fragmentary (草稿) -> passionate-declarative (category theory tools) -> scholarly-casual (solved problems list). Maximum register variety in minimum space.\n\n**Experiential Observation:** The essay's scattered form performs its thesis about jing-construction on a micro scale. Each short section is its own dreamscape. The cumulative effect is of a mind alive with connections, seeing jing everywhere. The essay's form IS the poetic.\n\n---\n\n### Index: 境集 (Jing Ji)\n\n**Structure:** The collection is divided into three parts with a deliberate architectural metaphor:\n- **上集：鱼 (Part One: Fish)** -- Essays 1-3. Standalone essays, each addressing a specific philosophical puzzle. Can be read individually.\n- **下集：渔 (Part Two: Fishing)** -- Essays 4-7. The systematic methodology. Interconnected, should be read as a unit. Explicitly marked as working drafts.\n- **附录 (Appendix)** -- Essay 8. Scattered thoughts, read after everything else.\n\n**Editorial Significance of the Structure:**\n- The Fish/Fishing division alludes to the proverb \"Give a man a fish / teach him to fish.\" Part One gives philosophical \"fish\" (specific answers); Part Two teaches the \"fishing\" (the method). This structural metaphor is load-bearing and must be preserved.\n- The index explicitly notes Part Two essays are \"working drafts with many unfinished parts.\" This reinforces B4.\n- Reading order is specified: sequential, despite being written at different times.\n\n---\n\n## Collection-Wide Editorial Observations\n\n**Voice Consistency:** The author's voice is remarkably consistent despite register range. The thinking-aloud quality, inclusive \"我们\" (we), willingness to leave things unfinished, and frequent connectives (\"事实上,\" \"也就是说\") create a recognizable authorial presence across all essays.\n\n**Progressive Density:** The collection moves from accessible (Essays 1-3) to increasingly dense (Essays 4-7) to deliberately fragmentary (Essay 8). This is a deliberate pedagogical arc.\n\n**Working-Draft Texture:** The entire collection, especially Part Two, retains explicit draft markers: todos, incomplete thoughts, self-corrections, typos. These are features per B4.\n\n**Five Registers Identified:**\n1. Colloquial/thinking-aloud: Dominant in Essays 1, 3, parts of 8\n2. Analytic: Dominant in Essay 2, sections of 4 and 7\n3. Classical quotation: Laozi, Yijing, Mengzi, Plato -- in Essays 4, 6, 8\n4. Mathematical/formal: Dominant in Essays 6-7\n5. Near-lyrical: Essay 3 (cat), Essay 5 (dreamscape), Essay 8 (opening, tools passage)\n\n**Key Cross-Essay Consistency Requirements:**\n- Terminology from Essay 4 (现象, 第一实在, 第二实在, 形而上, 恒常, 非理性) must be consistent across Essays 5-8\n- 境 must be consistent from Essay 5 (梦境) through Essays 6-7 (formalized) to Essay 8\n- 诗意 must be consistent from Essay 5 through Essay 8\n- All dictionary terms must be checked against the Translation Dictionary\n\n---\n\n## Expert Report Notes\n\nHaving read all 9 expert analysis reports, I extract the following editorially relevant insights:\n\n### The Essays as Philosophical Experiments (CRITICAL FOR EDITING)\n\nMultiple experts (Metaphysics, Phenomenology, Epistemology, Existentialism) independently identified that many passages in the essays function as **philosophical experiments conducted on the reader**. The experiential sequence is LOAD-BEARING, not merely illustrative. Key experimental passages:\n\n1. **The Sisyphus-to-cat gradient (Essay 3):** Three-stage descent from cosmic to domestic. The cat passage must NOT be condensed -- the accumulation of mundane detail IS the philosophical payload. The reader must *feel* the absence of absurdity, not just read about it.\n\n2. **The 道德仁义礼 reversal (Essay 4):** Methodical inversion of the standard hierarchy. The step-by-step quality induces a \"mini-epoche\" in the reader (phenomenology expert's term). Breaking this into disconnected points would destroy the experimental effect.\n\n3. **The 1+1=2 example (Essay 7):** Explicitly invites introspection on \"直接确认感\" (direct confirmatory feeling). Must be experientially vivid.\n\n4. **The three Bob examples (Essay 2):** Bob 3 (emotional reverie, no belief formed) is the experimental payload. The sprinkler in Bob 2 and the emotional absorption in Bob 3 are structurally necessary, not interchangeable.\n\n5. **The coin-flip passage (Essay 8):** Compact experiment. The reader who has done this recognizes it immediately. Must be crisp.\n\n**EDITORIAL IMPLICATION:** When editing translations of these passages, my R7 responsibility (flag experientially flat translations) is at maximum importance. If the translation is accurate but fails to reproduce the experiential sequence, the philosophical content is lost because the content IS the restructuring of the reader's 境.\n\n### Terminology Consensus Across Experts\n\nThe experts broadly converge on the following renderings (to be checked against the Dictionary):\n- 境: Transliterate as \"Jing\" with gloss (unanimous)\n- 现象: \"phenomena\" (unanimous, with note on phenomenological weight)\n- 第一实在 / 第二实在 / 第〇实在: \"First Reality\" / \"Second Reality\" / \"Zeroth Reality\" (near-unanimous)\n- 恒常: \"constancy\" (metaphysics expert), NOT \"permanence\" or \"invariance\"\n- 非理性: \"the non-rational\" (NOT \"irrational\" -- this distinction is load-bearing)\n- 诗意: \"the poetic\" (near-unanimous; NOT \"poetry\" or \"poetic meaning\")\n- 梦境: \"dreamscape\" (unanimous)\n- 沉醉的/清醒的梦境: \"intoxicated/lucid dreamscape\" (unanimous)\n- 形而上 vs 形而上学: \"the metaphysical\" vs \"metaphysics\" (consistent across experts)\n- 联想: \"association\" (unanimous, with phenomenological weight noted)\n- 泛性质/范性质: \"universal property\" (standard mathematical term)\n\n### Register and Pacing Warnings from Experts\n\n- **Phenomenology expert:** The two types of 感受 (received stimulation vs. crystallization/surge/turbulence) in Essay 5 are a philosophically precise distinction. The translation must preserve this.\n- **Existentialism expert:** 诗意 is NOT aesthetic ornamentation but an entire existential stance. If translated as just \"poetic meaning,\" it loses its weight. Must be \"the poetic\" -- functioning like Heidegger's \"das Dichterische.\"\n- **Chinese philosophy expert:** The Laozi passage in Essay 4 is NOT being interpreted as Laozi scholarship. The author is using the structure as an illustration. The translation must make this distinction clear.\n- **Buddhism expert:** 境 has deep resonances with Buddhist 境界 (visaya, gocara, ayatana) that inform the term's registers. The translator should be aware of these resonances without over-explicating them.\n- **Wittgenstein expert:** The author's use of \"language games\" is a productive but reoriented extension of Wittgenstein. The translation should not assimilate it to standard Wittgensteinian usage without noting the author's modifications.\n\n### Intersubjectivity via eta (Multiple Experts)\n\nMultiple experts (metaphysics, phenomenology, epistemology, existentialism) independently flagged the natural transformation eta as providing a structural account of intersubjectivity. The key insight: two people \"understand\" the same thing when their respective eta have the same structural form, without needing shared qualia. This is philosophically significant and should be clearly conveyed in translation.\n\n### The Closing Passage of Essay 7 / Essay 8\n\nThe existentialism and phenomenology experts both identify the closing passage of K1策略 (from poetry through memes to lullabies) and the long passage in Essay 8 about tools and jing-construction as the collection's emotional and philosophical climax. These passages must be translated with maximum force. They represent the moment where the formal apparatus connects to lived human experience.\n\n---\n\n## Dictionary Notes\n\nHaving read the Translation Dictionary in full, I extract the following editorially relevant observations:\n\n### Terms That Will Be Editorially Challenging in Running Prose\n\n1. **\"the metaphysical\" (形而上) as a count noun** -- \"a metaphysical\" sounds unusual in English. The dictionary permits \"a metaphysical construct\" as alternative. I need to watch for contexts where the bare \"a metaphysical\" reads awkwardly and flag for the translator.\n\n2. **\"(constitutive) character\" for 德** -- This is a creative solution but the parenthetical will feel heavy in repeated use. After first occurrence, \"character\" alone should flow naturally. The SPLIT convention (virtue in block quotes, character in analysis) requires careful editorial tracking.\n\n3. **\"phenomenal ritual conduct / phenomenal humaneness / phenomenal rightness\"** -- These are 6-8 syllable compound terms that will create dense, heavy sentences. The \"phenomenal X\" prefix MUST be preserved per B9 (intentional repetition), but I should flag sentences where the accumulation becomes unreadable.\n\n4. **\"feeling\" for 感受** -- The everyday English word \"feeling\" carrying this much philosophical weight will sometimes read too casual. The \"felt experience\" variant is available for technical contexts, but the trigger criterion (\"Is it naming a type of thing or describing what someone feels?\") requires editorial judgment case by case.\n\n5. **\"the poetic\" for 诗意** -- This works as a substantive but will be awkward in some syntactic positions. \"Poetic stance\" and \"poetic mode\" are available variants. Capitalization convention (capitalized on first occurrence per essay, lowercase thereafter) needs tracking.\n\n6. **\"Jing\" (romanized) for 境** -- A transliterated term in running English prose always risks feeling alien. The -scape echo system (dreamscape = dream + 境) helps ground it. The first-occurrence apparatus (glossary note, -scape footnote) must be positioned to not break reading flow (R6).\n\n### Glossing Conventions to Enforce\n\n- **First occurrence per essay**: \"English (漢字, *pinyin*)\" format for key terms\n- **-scape echo footnote**: Must appear at first introduction of Jing, explaining the morphological link\n- **Translator's notes (TNs)**: Required for 感受, 前形而上学, 境界 (at line 25 only), 沉醉, 德, and 范畴论. Must verify these don't break experiential momentum (R6)\n- **Block quote convention for Laozi**: Original 文言 in block quote with full English rendering, attribution \"adapted from Ivanhoe (2003)\"\n\n### Formatting/Consistency Concerns\n\n- **Capitalization system**: First Reality / Second Reality / Zeroth Reality -- always capitalized as technical terms. \"The Poetic\" capitalized in glossary/titles, lowercase in running text after first mention per essay. \"Jing\" always capitalized.\n- **Mathematical notation**: Must be preserved exactly. All LaTeX formulas, Fraktur script for full P, calligraphic E for subcategories.\n- **Italic/bold system from Essay 4**: Italics mark special terms, bold marks emphasis. This is the author's notational system and must be preserved per B5.\n- **The \"phenomenal X\" prefix system**: Must be consistent across all occurrences (现象礼, 现象仁, 现象义) -- never drop the prefix.\n- **NEVER translate 虚无 as \"emptiness\"** -- reserved for Buddhist 空/sunyata. Non-negotiable.\n- **NEVER translate 非理性 as \"irrational\"** -- must be \"the non-rational.\" Load-bearing distinction.\n\n### Cross-Essay Term Tracking Checklist\n\nThe following terms appear across multiple essays and must be tracked for consistency:\n- 现象/phenomena (Essays 1-8)\n- 第一/二/〇实在 (Essays 4-8)\n- 形而上/the metaphysical (Essays 4-8)\n- 恒常/constancy (Essays 4, 6, 7, 8)\n- 境/Jing (Essays 5-8)\n- 诗意/the poetic (Essays 5, 7, 8)\n- 梦境/dreamscape (Essays 5, 8)\n- 非理性/the non-rational (Essays 4, 6, 7)\n- 感受/feeling (all essays)\n- 联想/association (Essays 6, 7)\n- 泛性质/universal property (Essays 6, 7)\n\n---\n\n## Translator's Memo Notes (editorial extraction)\n\nRead the translator's full memo at `/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Memo.md`. Below are the editorially relevant items I need to track.\n\n### Translation Approach Decisions That Affect Editing\n\n1. **Title format**: \"**Jing Ji** (境集) / *Collected Essays on Jing*\" — the romanized title with subtitle. As editor I need to ensure this format is consistent wherever the title appears.\n\n2. **First-occurrence glossing protocol**: Key terms get \"English (漢字, *pinyin*)\" on first occurrence per essay. This means I will see these glosses repeatedly across essays. I need to verify: (a) the gloss appears on the FIRST occurrence and not later, (b) the format is consistent, (c) after the first occurrence the gloss is dropped and plain English used.\n\n3. **Classical Chinese quotation format**: Original 文言 in block quote, followed by glossed English rendering. The 文言/modern boundary must be visible through formatting (block-indent vs. running text). I need to enforce this formatting distinction consistently.\n\n4. **\"Phenomenal X\" compounds NEVER drop the prefix** — even when repetitive, even when heavy. This is now a hard rule from both the translator and the Dictionary. My job is to manage density around these terms, not to abbreviate them.\n\n5. **Re-glossing at register transitions**: When a term (e.g., 仁) shifts from classical quotation context to the author's modern analysis, a brief \"(仁)\" reminder is added. I need to check these appear at the right moments — not too often (cluttering), not too rarely (losing the reader).\n\n6. **德 SPLIT convention**: \"Virtue\" in the Laozi block quote rendering, \"(constitutive) character\" in the author's analysis. This is a deliberate terminological shift within a single passage. I need to verify the TN explaining this shift is properly placed and visible.\n\n### Resolved Questions That Affect Editing\n\n7. **Q1 — 诗意 capitalization**: \"The Poetic\" (capitalized) as substantive on first occurrence per essay, lowercase \"poetic\" as adjective thereafter. I need to track this across all essays where it appears (5, 7, 8).\n\n8. **Q3 — Essay 2 untouched**: The translator will NOT edit the author's native English. Three translator's footnotes will be added connecting author's informal terms to formal counterparts. I need to ensure these footnotes are editorially integrated without breaking the essay's own voice (B6 applies).\n\n9. **Q5 — Meme sentence replacement**: The Chinese internet meme in K1 will be replaced with an English grammatically-plausible-but-semantically-void sentence, NOT literally translated. A translator's note cites the original Chinese. This is an unusual editorial situation — I need to verify the replacement sentence achieves the right effect (natively incomprehensible in English, not \"bad translation\" feeling).\n\n10. **Q6 — 虚妄 = \"vain presumption\"**: Author's personal coinage, NOT Buddhist usage. Footnote disambiguates. I need to verify this footnote is present and clear.\n\n11. **Q7 — 形 = 现象 reinterpretation note**: Half-page in Translator's Introduction + footnote at first occurrence in Essay 4. This is the same TN2 I already reviewed in the DaoDeRenYiLi draft. Confirmed: it is well-placed and clear.\n\n### Glossary as Editorial Reference\n\nThe translator's core glossary table (Section 2 of the Translation Approach) contains 40+ terms with their agreed English renderings. This is my primary reference for B1 (never alter terminology from the Dictionary). Key items I will check most frequently:\n\n- 境 = Jing / E (technical)\n- 形而上 = the metaphysical (NOT \"metaphysics\")\n- 形而上学 = metaphysics (NOT \"the metaphysical\")\n- 非理性 = the non-rational (NOT \"irrational\")\n- 恒常 = constancy (NOT \"permanence\" / \"regularity\" / \"invariance\")\n- 虚无 = the void / nothingness (NEVER \"emptiness\")\n- 感受 = feeling / felt experience (context-dependent)\n- 德 = De / character (NEVER \"virtue\" outside the Laozi block quote)\n\n### Register Strategy Alignment\n\nThe translator identifies the same 5 registers I identified independently. Good — we are aligned. The translator's notes add one important detail: Essay 2's register (analytic philosophy) serves as the **register standard** for the analytic passages. This means when I edit analytic passages in translated essays, I should check them against Essay 2's natural voice for calibration.\n\n### Reference Translations\n\nThe translator has collected three standard English translations of the Laozi Ch. 38 passage (Ivanhoe, Lau, Wing-tsit Chan). TN1 in the draft cites Ivanhoe and explains departures. I verified this in my review — it is well-done. For any future classical Chinese passages, I should check whether reference translations have been similarly collected and cited.\n\n### Structural Principles — My Enforcement Checklist\n\nThe translator lists 5 structural principles. These map directly to my hard boundaries:\n\n| Translator's Principle | My Boundary |\n|------------------------|-------------|\n| Preserve experiential sequences exactly | B2 (never restructure/reorder) |\n| Preserve working-draft quality | B4 (never polish away drafts) |\n| Preserve bilingual nature | B6 (never harmonize Essay 2) |\n| Preserve fish/fishing structure | B2 (never restructure) |\n| Footnotes are philosophically essential | R6 (verify footnote integration) |\n\nThis alignment is reassuring — the translator and I are working from the same constraints.\n\n---\n\n## Expert Questions\n\n### Q1: \"Phenomenal X\" density management in English prose\n\n**Problem:** The author's coined compounds 现象礼, 现象仁, 现象义 are 3 syllables each in Chinese. Their English equivalents — \"phenomenal ritual conduct\" (8 syllables), \"phenomenal humaneness\" (7 syllables), \"phenomenal rightness\" (6 syllables) — are dramatically heavier. In the long analytical paragraphs of Essay 4, these terms accumulate 5-6 times per sentence. The Dictionary and B9 require preserving the \"phenomenal\" prefix always. But the resulting English is borderline unreadable in places.\n\n**Question for Chinese philosophy expert:** In the original Chinese, does the repetition of 现象X create any sense of heaviness or accumulation for a native Chinese reader, or does the 3-character compactness make it feel natural and light? I need to understand whether density management in English should aim for \"transparent/invisible\" (matching the Chinese reader's experience) or \"deliberately weighty\" (if the Chinese reader also feels the terms accumulating).\n\n**Status:** RESOLVED — Answer: both light individually AND dense cumulatively. Hybrid strategy: keep all repetition, manage density through sentence architecture, shape as crescendo toward reversal. See Q1 file for full response.\n\n","numLines":389,"startLine":1,"totalLines":389}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"0dd3ff38-3c95-48d5-be1d-3afa25d24c60"}

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n    15→\n    16→集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n    17→\n    18→No single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n    19→\n    20→The author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n    21→\n    22→We treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n    23→\n    24→The \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n    25→\n    26→---\n    27→\n    28→## The Author\n    29→\n    30→The author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by practice. The author thinks from within the Chinese philosophical tradition -- drawing on the *Laozi*, the *Yijing*, and the Confucian vocabulary of 仁, 义, 礼, and 德 -- while subjecting that tradition to a radical constructivist reinterpretation. This dual formation -- Chinese philosophical inheritance and scientific training -- is not incidental to the text. Physics concepts recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n    31→\n    32→The author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently.

Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n    35→\n    36→---\n    37→\n    38→## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n    39→\n    40→The collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n    41→\n    42→- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n    43→- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n    44→- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n    45→\n    46→The division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n    47→\n    48→This is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n    49→\n    50→We recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n    51→\n    52→---\n    53→\n    54→## A Bilingual Collection\n    55→\n    56→One of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n    57→\n    58→We have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n    59→\n    60→We have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n    61→\n    62→---\n    63→\n    64→## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n    65→\n    66→A note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n    67→\n    68→The Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n    69→\n    70→> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n    71→> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n    72→\n    73→In its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n    74→\n    75→The author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n    76→\n    77→This reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n    78→\n    79→A footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n    80→\n    81→---\n    82→\n    83→## Key Terminological Decisions\n    84→\n    85→These essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n    86→\n    87→### Jing (境) and E\n    88→\n    89→As discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n    90→\n    91→### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n    92→\n    93→The author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n    94→\n    95→### Phenomena (现象)\n    96→\n    97→The author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n    98→\n    99→### Constancy (恒常)\n   100→\n   101→The drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n   102→\n   103→### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n   104→\n   105→The author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n   106→\n   107→### The Poetic (诗意)\n   108→\n   109→The author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n   110→\n   111→\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n   112→\n   113→To make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n   114→\n   115→Readers familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n   116→\n   117→### Dreamscape (梦境)\n   118→\n   119→The author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not grounded in inherent existence, functional within its own terms.\n   120→\n   121→### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n   122→\n   123→The author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n   124→\n   125→### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n   126→\n   127→In Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n   128→\n   129→A critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n   130→\n   131→The remaining terms: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" (following Ames and Rosemont), emphasizing the inner feeling over the behavioral expression. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness,\" capturing the motivational disposition rather than the moral judgment that \"righteousness\" implies. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension.\n   132→\n   133→The author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument.\n   134→\n   135→### Three Realities\n   136→\n   137→The author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n   138→\n   139→- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n   140→- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n   141→- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n   142→\n   143→The numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\"\n   144→\n   145→### Other Terms\n   146→\n   147→**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; \"the off-tone\" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n   148→\n   149→A complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n   150→\n   151→---\n   152→\n   153→## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n   154→\n   155→This collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it. This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n   156→\n   157→Three examples, among many:\n   158→\n   159→In Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n   160→\n   161→In Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n   162→\n   163→In Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n   164→\n   165→We have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter. This is not a stylistic preference but a philosophical necessity: if the reader's experience is the evidence for the author's claims, then a translation that preserves the words but fails to produce the experience has lost the argument. In these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n   166→\n   167→---\n   168→\n   169→## A Note on Reading\n   170→\n   171→The author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n   172→\n   173→The three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n   174→\n   175→Readers without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n   176→\n   177→---\n   178→\n   179→*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n   180→\n   181→---\n   182→\n   183→## Glossary\n   184→\n   185→*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n   186→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by practice. The author thinks from within the Chinese philosophical tradition -- drawing on the *Laozi*, the *Yijing*, and the Confucian vocabulary of 仁, 义, 礼, and 德 -- while subjecting that tradition to a radical constructivist reinterpretation. This dual formation -- Chinese philosophical inheritance and scientific training -- is not incidental to the text. Physics concepts recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\nThe collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\nTo make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n\nReaders familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not grounded in inherent existence, functional within its own terms.\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" (following Ames and Rosemont), emphasizing the inner feeling over the behavioral expression. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness,\" capturing the motivational disposition rather than the moral judgment that \"righteousness\" implies. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument.\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\"\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; \"the off-tone\" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it. This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter. This is not a stylistic preference but a philosophical necessity: if the reader's experience is the evidence for the author's claims, then a translation that preserves the words but fails to produce the experience has lost the argument. In these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n\n---\n\n## Glossary\n\n*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n","numLines":186,"startLine":1,"totalLines":186}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"9a615b51-96a1-4c40-9bae-0b163ccd34d5"}

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n    15→\n    16→集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n    17→\n    18→No single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n    19→\n    20→The author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n    21→\n    22→We treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n    23→\n    24→The \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n    25→\n    26→---\n    27→\n    28→## The Author\n    29→\n    30→The author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by practice. The author thinks from within the Chinese philosophical tradition -- drawing on the *Laozi*, the *Yijing*, and the Confucian vocabulary of 仁, 义, 礼, and 德 -- while subjecting that tradition to a radical constructivist reinterpretation. This dual formation -- Chinese philosophical inheritance and scientific training -- is not incidental to the text. Physics concepts recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n    31→\n    32→The author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n    33→\n    34→The collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n    35→\n    36→---\n    37→\n    38→## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n    39→\n    40→The collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n    41→\n    42→- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n    43→- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n    44→- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n    45→\n    46→The division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n    47→\n    48→This is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n    49→\n    50→We recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n    51→\n    52→---\n    53→\n    54→## A Bilingual Collection\n    55→\n    56→One of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n    57→\n    58→We have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n    59→\n    60→We have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n    61→\n    62→---\n    63→\n    64→## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n    65→\n    66→A note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n    67→\n    68→The Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n    69→\n    70→> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n    71→> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n    72→\n    73→In its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n    74→\n    75→The author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n    76→\n    77→This reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n    78→\n    79→A footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n    80→\n    81→---\n    82→\n    83→## Key Terminological Decisions\n    84→\n    85→These essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n    86→\n    87→### Jing (境) and E\n    88→\n    89→As discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n    90→\n    91→### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n    92→\n    93→The author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n    94→\n    95→### Phenomena (现象)\n    96→\n    97→The author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n    98→\n    99→### Constancy (恒常)\n   100→\n   101→The drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n   102→\n   103→### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n   104→\n   105→The author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n   106→\n   107→### The Poetic (诗意)\n   108→\n   109→The author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n   110→\n   111→\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n   112→\n   113→To make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n   114→\n   115→Readers familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n   116→\n   117→### Dreamscape (梦境)\n   118→\n   119→The author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not grounded in inherent existence, functional within its own terms.\n   120→\n   121→### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n   122→\n   123→The author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n   124→\n   125→### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n   126→\n   127→In Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n   128→\n   129→A critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n   130→\n   131→The remaining terms: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" (following Ames and Rosemont), emphasizing the inner feeling over the behavioral expression. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness,\" capturing the motivational disposition rather than the moral judgment that \"righteousness\" implies. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension.\n   132→\n   133→The author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument. Readers should watch for the moment when the author shows how an inductively observed *property* (something people happen to have) is silently transformed into a normative *definition* (what people must be) -- this reversal from property to definition is perhaps the collection's most original philosophical move, and it recurs throughout.\n   134→\n   135→Note that the reader will encounter two different English words for the same Chinese character within a single passage: 德 appears as \"virtue\" when quoting Laozi and as \"character\" when the author analyzes the concept. This is deliberate, not an inconsistency -- it reflects the author's argument that the traditional reading (virtue, imposed from above) conceals the constructive process (character, assembled from below).\n   136→\n   137→### Three Realities\n   138→\n   139→The author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n   140→\n   141→- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n   142→- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n   143→- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n   144→\n   145→The numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\"\n   146→\n   147→### Other Terms\n   148→\n   149→**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; \"the off-tone\" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n   150→\n   151→A complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n   152→\n   153→---\n   154→\n   155→## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n   156→\n   157→This collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it. This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n   158→\n   159→Three examples, among many:\n   160→\n   161→In Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n   162→\n   163→In Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n   164→\n   165→In Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n   166→\n   167→We have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter. This is not a stylistic preference but a philosophical necessity: if the reader's experience is the evidence for the author's claims, then a translation that preserves the words but fails to produce the experience has lost the argument. In these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n   168→\n   169→---\n   170→\n   171→## A Note on Reading\n   172→\n   173→The author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n   174→\n   175→The three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n   176→\n   177→Readers without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n   178→\n   179→---\n   180→\n   181→*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n   182→\n   183→---\n   184→\n   185→## Glossary\n   186→\n   187→*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n   188→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by practice. The author thinks from within the Chinese philosophical tradition -- drawing on the *Laozi*, the *Yijing*, and the Confucian vocabulary of 仁, 义, 礼, and 德 -- while subjecting that tradition to a radical constructivist reinterpretation. This dual formation -- Chinese philosophical inheritance and scientific training -- is not incidental to the text. Physics concepts recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\nThe collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\nTo make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n\nReaders familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not grounded in inherent existence, functional within its own terms.\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" (following Ames and Rosemont), emphasizing the inner feeling over the behavioral expression. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness,\" capturing the motivational disposition rather than the moral judgment that \"righteousness\" implies. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument. Readers should watch for the moment when the author shows how an inductively observed *property* (something people happen to have) is silently transformed into a normative *definition* (what people must be) -- this reversal from property to definition is perhaps the collection's most original philosophical move, and it recurs throughout.\n\nNote that the reader will encounter two different English words for the same Chinese character within a single passage: 德 appears as \"virtue\" when quoting Laozi and as \"character\" when the author analyzes the concept. This is deliberate, not an inconsistency -- it reflects the author's argument that the traditional reading (virtue, imposed from above) conceals the constructive process (character, assembled from below).\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\"\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; \"the off-tone\" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it. This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter. This is not a stylistic preference but a philosophical necessity: if the reader's experience is the evidence for the author's claims, then a translation that preserves the words but fails to produce the experience has lost the argument. In these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n\n---\n\n## Glossary\n\n*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n","numLines":188,"startLine":1,"totalLines":188}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"0283ccf5-120e-43d6-b0cc-8c4f0200144a"}

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n    15→\n    16→集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n    17→\n    18→No single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n    19→\n    20→The author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n    21→\n    22→We treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n    23→\n    24→The \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n    25→\n    26→---\n    27→\n    28→## The Author\n    29→\n    30→The author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by practice. The author thinks from within the Chinese philosophical tradition -- drawing on the *Laozi*, the *Yijing*, and the Confucian vocabulary of 仁, 义, 礼, and 德 -- while subjecting that tradition to a radical constructivist reinterpretation. This dual formation -- Chinese philosophical inheritance and scientific training -- is not incidental to the text. Physics concepts recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n    31→\n    32→The author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n    33→\n    34→The collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n    35→\n    36→---\n    37→\n    38→## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n    39→\n    40→The collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n    41→\n    42→- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n    43→- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n    44→- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n    45→\n    46→The division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n    47→\n    48→This is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n    49→\n    50→We recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n    51→\n    52→---\n    53→\n    54→## A Bilingual Collection\n    55→\n    56→One of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n    57→\n    58→We have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n    59→\n    60→We have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n    61→\n    62→---\n    63→\n    64→## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n    65→\n    66→A note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n    67→\n    68→The Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n    69→\n    70→> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n    71→> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n    72→\n    73→In its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n    74→\n    75→The author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n    76→\n    77→This reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n    78→\n    79→A footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n    80→\n    81→---\n    82→\n    83→## Key Terminological Decisions\n    84→\n    85→These essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n    86→\n    87→### Jing (境) and E\n    88→\n    89→As discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n    90→\n    91→### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n    92→\n    93→The author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n    94→\n    95→### Phenomena (现象)\n    96→\n    97→The author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n    98→\n    99→### Constancy (恒常)\n   100→\n   101→The drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n   102→\n   103→### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n   104→\n   105→The author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n   106→\n   107→### The Poetic (诗意)\n   108→\n   109→The author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n   110→\n   111→\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n   112→\n   113→To make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n   114→\n   115→Readers familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n   116→\n   117→### Dreamscape (梦境)\n   118→\n   119→The author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not grounded in inherent existence, functional within its own terms.\n   120→\n   121→### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n   122→\n   123→The author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n   124→\n   125→### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n   126→\n   127→In Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse.

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by practice. The author thinks from within the Chinese philosophical tradition -- drawing on the *Laozi*, the *Yijing*, and the Confucian vocabulary of 仁, 义, 礼, and 德 -- while subjecting that tradition to a radical constructivist reinterpretation. This dual formation -- Chinese philosophical inheritance and scientific training -- is not incidental to the text. Physics concepts recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\nThe collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\nTo make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n\nReaders familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not grounded in inherent existence, functional within its own terms.\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms depart from common translations for specific reasons: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" rather than the more common \"benevolence\" (following Ames and Rosemont), because the author emphasizes the inner felt experience of fellow-feeling before any outward action -- \"benevolence\" connotes charitable giving, which is too external. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness\" rather than \"righteousness,\" because the author treats it as a motivational disposition (the felt impulse connecting inner feeling to action), not a moralistic or absolutist judgment. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct\" rather than \"rites\" or \"propriety,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension that the author takes as the phenomenal starting point.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument. Readers should watch for the moment when the author shows how an inductively observed *property* (something people happen to have) is silently transformed into a normative *definition* (what people must be) -- this reversal from property to definition is perhaps the collection's most original philosophical move, and it recurs throughout.\n\nNote that the reader will encounter two different English words for the same Chinese character within a single passage: 德 appears as \"virtue\" when quoting Laozi and as \"character\" when the author analyzes the concept. This is deliberate, not an inconsistency -- it reflects the author's argument that the traditional reading (virtue, imposed from above) conceals the constructive process (character, assembled from below).\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\" Readers familiar with Kant will notice that Zeroth Reality resembles the *Ding an sich* (thing-in-itself), but with a decisive difference: for Kant, the thing-in-itself is a necessary limiting concept that philosophy cannot do without; for this author, Zeroth Reality is genuinely dispensable -- one can do all of philosophy, and live, without ever invoking it.\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; \"the off-tone\" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it. This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter. This is not a stylistic preference but a philosophical necessity: if the reader's experience is the evidence for the author's claims, then a translation that preserves the words but fails to produce the experience has lost the argument. In these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them.

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n    15→\n    16→集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n    17→\n    18→No single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n    19→\n    20→The author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n    21→\n    22→We treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n    23→\n    24→The \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n    25→\n    26→---\n    27→\n    28→## The Author\n    29→\n    30→The author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by practice. The author thinks from within the Chinese philosophical tradition -- drawing on the *Laozi*, the *Yijing*, and the Confucian vocabulary of 仁, 义, 礼, and 德 -- while subjecting that tradition to a radical constructivist reinterpretation. This dual formation -- Chinese philosophical inheritance and scientific training -- is not incidental to the text. Physics concepts recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n    31→\n    32→The author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n    33→\n    34→The collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n    35→\n    36→---\n    37→\n    38→## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n    39→\n    40→The collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n    41→\n    42→- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n    43→- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n    44→- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n    45→\n    46→The division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n    47→\n    48→This is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n    49→\n    50→We recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n    51→\n    52→Two structural claims of the collection deserve advance notice. First, the author treats nihilism not as the negation of metaphysics but as its *consequence*: when metaphysical systems claim to describe ultimate reality and then fail, the void they leave is nihilism. Post-metaphysics is the path that emerges after recognizing this -- not by rejecting metaphysical construction, but by practicing it lucidly. Second, the author treats absurdity not as a permanent human condition (as in Camus) but as a structural collapse: absurdity arises when one's Jing seeks meaning externally and finds none. The dissolution of absurdity -- demonstrated in Essay 3 through the progression from Sisyphus to cat ownership -- is achieved not by revolt but by reconstructing the Jing so that meaning is internally generated.\n    53→\n    54→---\n    55→\n    56→## A Bilingual Collection\n    57→\n    58→One of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n    59→\n    60→We have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n    61→\n    62→We have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n    63→\n    64→---\n    65→\n    66→## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n    67→\n    68→A note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n    69→\n    70→The Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n    71→\n    72→> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n    73→> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n    74→\n    75→In its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n    76→\n    77→The author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n    78→\n    79→This reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n    80→\n    81→A footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n    82→\n    83→---\n    84→\n    85→## Key Terminological Decisions\n    86→\n    87→These essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n    88→\n    89→### Jing (境) and E\n    90→\n    91→As discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n    92→\n    93→### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n    94→\n    95→The author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n    96→\n    97→### Phenomena (现象)\n    98→\n    99→The author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n   100→\n   101→### Constancy (恒常)\n   102→\n   103→The drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n   104→\n   105→### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n   106→\n   107→The author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n   108→\n   109→### The Poetic (诗意)\n   110→\n   111→The author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n   112→\n   113→\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n   114→\n   115→To make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n   116→\n   117→Readers familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n   118→\n   119→### Dreamscape (梦境)\n   120→\n   121→The author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not necessarily grounded in anything beyond the experience itself, functional within its own terms. (The author does not commit to the Madhyamaka ontology of the Diamond Sutra; the parallel is structural, not doctrinal.)\n   122→\n   123→### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n   124→\n   125→The author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n   126→\n   127→### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n   128→\n   129→In Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n   130→\n   131→A critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n   132→\n   133→The remaining terms depart from common translations for specific reasons: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" rather than the more common \"benevolence\" (following Ames and Rosemont), because the author emphasizes the inner felt experience of fellow-feeling before any outward action -- \"benevolence\" connotes charitable giving, which is too external. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness\" rather than \"righteousness,\" because the author treats it as a motivational disposition (the felt impulse connecting inner feeling to action), not a moralistic or absolutist judgment. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct\" rather than \"rites\" or \"propriety,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension that the author takes as the phenomenal starting point.\n   134→\n   135→The author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument. Readers should watch for the moment when the author shows how an inductively observed *property* (something people happen to have) is silently transformed into a normative *definition* (what people must be) -- this reversal from property to definition is perhaps the collection's most original philosophical move, and it recurs throughout.\n   136→\n   137→Note that the reader will encounter two different English words for the same Chinese character within a single passage: 德 appears as \"virtue\" when quoting Laozi and as \"character\" when the author analyzes the concept. This is deliberate, not an inconsistency -- it reflects the author's argument that the traditional reading (virtue, imposed from above) conceals the constructive process (character, assembled from below).\n   138→\n   139→### Three Realities\n   140→\n   141→The author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n   142→\n   143→- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n   144→- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n   145→- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n   146→\n   147→The numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\" Readers familiar with Kant will notice that Zeroth Reality resembles the *Ding an sich* (thing-in-itself), but with a decisive difference: for Kant, the thing-in-itself is a necessary limiting concept that philosophy cannot do without; for this author, Zeroth Reality is genuinely dispensable -- one can do all of philosophy, and live, without ever invoking it.\n   148→\n   149→### Other Terms\n   150→\n   151→**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; \"the off-tone\" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n   152→\n   153→A complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n   154→\n   155→---\n   156→\n   157→## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n   158→\n   159→This collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it. This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n   160→\n   161→Three examples, among many:\n   162→\n   163→In Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n   164→\n   165→In Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n   166→\n   167→In Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n   168→\n   169→We have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter. This is not a stylistic preference but a philosophical necessity: if the reader's experience is the evidence for the author's claims, then a translation that preserves the words but fails to produce the experience has lost the argument. In these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n   170→\n   171→---\n   172→\n   173→## A Note on Reading\n   174→\n   175→The author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n   176→\n   177→The three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n   178→\n   179→Readers without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n   180→\n   181→---\n   182→\n   183→*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n   184→\n   185→---\n   186→\n   187→## Glossary\n   188→\n   189→*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n   190→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by practice. The author thinks from within the Chinese philosophical tradition -- drawing on the *Laozi*, the *Yijing*, and the Confucian vocabulary of 仁, 义, 礼, and 德 -- while subjecting that tradition to a radical constructivist reinterpretation. This dual formation -- Chinese philosophical inheritance and scientific training -- is not incidental to the text. Physics concepts recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\nThe collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\nTwo structural claims of the collection deserve advance notice. First, the author treats nihilism not as the negation of metaphysics but as its *consequence*: when metaphysical systems claim to describe ultimate reality and then fail, the void they leave is nihilism. Post-metaphysics is the path that emerges after recognizing this -- not by rejecting metaphysical construction, but by practicing it lucidly. Second, the author treats absurdity not as a permanent human condition (as in Camus) but as a structural collapse: absurdity arises when one's Jing seeks meaning externally and finds none. The dissolution of absurdity -- demonstrated in Essay 3 through the progression from Sisyphus to cat ownership -- is achieved not by revolt but by reconstructing the Jing so that meaning is internally generated.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\nTo make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n\nReaders familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not necessarily grounded in anything beyond the experience itself, functional within its own terms. (The author does not commit to the Madhyamaka ontology of the Diamond Sutra; the parallel is structural, not doctrinal.)\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms depart from common translations for specific reasons: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" rather than the more common \"benevolence\" (following Ames and Rosemont), because the author emphasizes the inner felt experience of fellow-feeling before any outward action -- \"benevolence\" connotes charitable giving, which is too external. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness\" rather than \"righteousness,\" because the author treats it as a motivational disposition (the felt impulse connecting inner feeling to action), not a moralistic or absolutist judgment. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct\" rather than \"rites\" or \"propriety,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension that the author takes as the phenomenal starting point.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument. Readers should watch for the moment when the author shows how an inductively observed *property* (something people happen to have) is silently transformed into a normative *definition* (what people must be) -- this reversal from property to definition is perhaps the collection's most original philosophical move, and it recurs throughout.\n\nNote that the reader will encounter two different English words for the same Chinese character within a single passage: 德 appears as \"virtue\" when quoting Laozi and as \"character\" when the author analyzes the concept. This is deliberate, not an inconsistency -- it reflects the author's argument that the traditional reading (virtue, imposed from above) conceals the constructive process (character, assembled from below).\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\" Readers familiar with Kant will notice that Zeroth Reality resembles the *Ding an sich* (thing-in-itself), but with a decisive difference: for Kant, the thing-in-itself is a necessary limiting concept that philosophy cannot do without; for this author, Zeroth Reality is genuinely dispensable -- one can do all of philosophy, and live, without ever invoking it.\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; \"the off-tone\" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it. This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter. This is not a stylistic preference but a philosophical necessity: if the reader's experience is the evidence for the author's claims, then a translation that preserves the words but fails to produce the experience has lost the argument. In these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n\n---\n\n## Glossary\n\n*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n","numLines":190,"startLine":1,"totalLines":190}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"96bf832f-4235-439a-a385-67de0e585600"}

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by practice. The author thinks from within the Chinese philosophical tradition -- drawing on the *Laozi*, the *Yijing*, and the Confucian vocabulary of 仁, 义, 礼, and 德 -- while subjecting that tradition to a radical constructivist reinterpretation. This dual formation -- Chinese philosophical inheritance and scientific training -- is not incidental to the text. Physics concepts recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\nThe collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\nTwo structural claims of the collection deserve advance notice. First, the author treats nihilism not as the negation of metaphysics but as its *consequence*: when metaphysical systems claim to describe ultimate reality and then fail, the void they leave is nihilism. Post-metaphysics is the path that emerges after recognizing this -- not by rejecting metaphysical construction, but by practicing it lucidly. Second, the author treats absurdity not as a permanent human condition (as in Camus) but as a structural collapse: absurdity arises when one's Jing seeks meaning externally and finds none. The dissolution of absurdity -- demonstrated in Essay 3 through the progression from Sisyphus to cat ownership -- is achieved not by revolt but by reconstructing the Jing so that meaning is internally generated.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\nTo make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n\nReaders familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not necessarily grounded in anything beyond the experience itself, functional within its own terms. (The author does not commit to the Madhyamaka ontology of the Diamond Sutra; the parallel is structural, not doctrinal.)\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms depart from common translations for specific reasons: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" rather than the more common \"benevolence\" (following Ames and Rosemont), because the author emphasizes the inner felt experience of fellow-feeling before any outward action -- \"benevolence\" connotes charitable giving, which is too external. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness\" rather than \"righteousness,\" because the author treats it as a motivational disposition (the felt impulse connecting inner feeling to action), not a moralistic or absolutist judgment. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct\" rather than \"rites\" or \"propriety,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension that the author takes as the phenomenal starting point.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument. Readers should watch for the moment when the author shows how an inductively observed *property* (something people happen to have) is silently transformed into a normative *definition* (what people must be) -- this reversal from property to definition is perhaps the collection's most original philosophical move, and it recurs throughout.\n\nNote that the reader will encounter two different English words for the same Chinese character within a single passage: 德 appears as \"virtue\" when quoting Laozi and as \"character\" when the author analyzes the concept. This is deliberate, not an inconsistency -- it reflects the author's argument that the traditional reading (virtue, imposed from above) conceals the constructive process (character, assembled from below).\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\" Readers familiar with Kant will notice that Zeroth Reality resembles the *Ding an sich* (thing-in-itself), but with a decisive difference: for Kant, the thing-in-itself is a necessary limiting concept that philosophy cannot do without; for this author, Zeroth Reality is genuinely dispensable -- one can do all of philosophy, and live, without ever invoking it.\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; \"the off-tone\" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it. This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter. This is not a stylistic preference but a philosophical necessity: if the reader's experience is the evidence for the author's claims, then a translation that preserves the words but fails to produce the experience has lost the argument. In these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n\n---\n\n## Glossary\n\n*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":31,"oldLines":8,"newStart":31,"newLines":6,"lines":[" "," The author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience.

Specific examples, page references, and fine-grained phrasing will be revised once the full translation exists.\nmodified: 2026-02-10T22:33:28-08:00\ncreated: 2026-02-10T22:11:13-08:00\n---\n\n# Translators-Preface\n\n## On the Title\n\nThe title of this collection is 境集 (*Jing Ji*). We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by practice. The author thinks from within the Chinese philosophical tradition -- drawing on the *Laozi*, the *Yijing*, and the Confucian vocabulary of 仁, 义, 礼, and 德 -- while subjecting that tradition to a radical constructivist reinterpretation. This dual formation -- Chinese philosophical inheritance and scientific training -- is not incidental to the text. Physics concepts recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\nTwo structural claims of the collection deserve advance notice. First, the author treats nihilism not as the negation of metaphysics but as its *consequence*: when metaphysical systems claim to describe ultimate reality and then fail, the void they leave is nihilism. Post-metaphysics is the path that emerges after recognizing this -- not by rejecting metaphysical construction, but by practicing it lucidly. Second, the author treats absurdity not as a permanent human condition (as in Camus) but as a structural collapse: absurdity arises when one's Jing seeks meaning externally and finds none. The dissolution of absurdity -- demonstrated in Essay 3 through the progression from Sisyphus to cat ownership -- is achieved not by revolt but by reconstructing the Jing so that meaning is internally generated.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\nTo make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n\nReaders familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not necessarily grounded in anything beyond the experience itself, functional within its own terms. (The author does not commit to the Madhyamaka ontology of the Diamond Sutra; the parallel is structural, not doctrinal.)\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms depart from common translations for specific reasons: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" rather than the more common \"benevolence\" (following Ames and Rosemont), because the author emphasizes the inner felt experience of fellow-feeling before any outward action -- \"benevolence\" connotes charitable giving, which is too external. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness\" rather than \"righteousness,\" because the author treats it as a motivational disposition (the felt impulse connecting inner feeling to action), not a moralistic or absolutist judgment. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct\" rather than \"rites\" or \"propriety,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension that the author takes as the phenomenal starting point.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument. Readers should watch for the moment when the author shows how an inductively observed *property* (something people happen to have) is silently transformed into a normative *definition* (what people must be) -- this reversal from property to definition is perhaps the collection's most original philosophical move, and it recurs throughout.\n\nNote that the reader will encounter two different English words for the same Chinese character within a single passage: 德 appears as \"virtue\" when quoting Laozi and as \"character\" when the author analyzes the concept. This is deliberate, not an inconsistency -- it reflects the author's argument that the traditional reading (virtue, imposed from above) conceals the constructive process (character, assembled from below).\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\" Readers familiar with Kant will notice that Zeroth Reality resembles the *Ding an sich* (thing-in-itself), but with a decisive difference: for Kant, the thing-in-itself is a necessary limiting concept that philosophy cannot do without; for this author, Zeroth Reality is genuinely dispensable -- one can do all of philosophy, and live, without ever invoking it.\n\n### Stable Structures (稳定结构)\n\nPatterns that persist as a Jing evolves over time -- the author's empirical replacement for a priori categories. Where Kant deduces the categories of understanding from the table of judgments, the author treats stable structures as discovered through experience and subject to revision: they are what survives the evolution of a Jing, not what precedes it. In mathematical contexts, these are denoted **S_E**.\n\n### Natural Transformations and Understanding (自然变换 / 理解)\n\nThe collection's most technically innovative contribution: the author formalizes \"understanding\" as a natural transformation (a standard concept in category theory) between two Jing-structures. When two people understand each other, or when a reader understands a text, what occurs is a structural alignment -- a systematic mapping that preserves associations. The felt confirmation that understanding has occurred is denoted **eta** (η). When eta is an identity morphism -- when no mediation is needed -- the author calls this **mastery** (掌握, *zhangwo*). This formalization provides a precise, non-mysterious account of intersubjectivity: shared understanding does not require shared inner experience, only structural alignment.\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; \"the off-tone\" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it. This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter. This is not a stylistic preference but a philosophical necessity: if the reader's experience is the evidence for the author's claims, then a translation that preserves the words but fails to produce the experience has lost the argument. In these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n\n---\n\n## Glossary\n\n*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":57,"oldLines":7,"newStart":57,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," We have not edited the author's English.

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n    15→\n    16→集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n    17→\n    18→No single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n    19→\n    20→The author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n    21→\n    22→We treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n    23→\n    24→The \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n    25→\n    26→---\n    27→\n    28→## The Author\n    29→\n    30→The author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by practice. The author thinks from within the Chinese philosophical tradition -- drawing on the *Laozi*, the *Yijing*, and the Confucian vocabulary of 仁, 义, 礼, and 德 -- while subjecting that tradition to a radical constructivist reinterpretation. This dual formation -- Chinese philosophical inheritance and scientific training -- is not incidental to the text. Physics concepts recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n    31→\n    32→The author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n    33→\n    34→---\n    35→\n    36→## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n    37→\n    38→The collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n    39→\n    40→- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n    41→- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n    42→- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n    43→\n    44→The division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n    45→\n    46→This is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n    47→\n    48→We recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n    49→\n    50→Two structural claims of the collection deserve advance notice. First, the author treats nihilism not as the negation of metaphysics but as its *consequence*: when metaphysical systems claim to describe ultimate reality and then fail, the void they leave is nihilism. Post-metaphysics is the path that emerges after recognizing this -- not by rejecting metaphysical construction, but by practicing it lucidly. Second, the author treats absurdity not as a permanent human condition (as in Camus) but as a structural collapse: absurdity arises when one's Jing seeks meaning externally and finds none. The dissolution of absurdity -- demonstrated in Essay 3 through the progression from Sisyphus to cat ownership -- is achieved not by revolt but by reconstructing the Jing so that meaning is internally generated.\n    51→\n    52→---\n    53→\n    54→## A Bilingual Collection\n    55→\n    56→One of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n    57→\n    58→We have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n    59→\n    60→We have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms -- particularly \"phenomena\" and \"digestion\" -- to their counterparts in the translated essays. Three translator's footnotes within the essay connect its key terms to the formal apparatus of Part 2.\n    61→\n    62→---\n    63→\n    64→## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n    65→\n    66→A note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n    67→\n    68→The Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n    69→\n    70→> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n    71→> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n    72→\n    73→In its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n    74→\n    75→The author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n    76→\n    77→This reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n    78→\n    79→A footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n    80→\n    81→---\n    82→\n    83→## Key Terminological Decisions\n    84→\n    85→These essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n    86→\n    87→### Jing (境) and E\n    88→\n    89→As discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n    90→\n    91→### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n    92→\n    93→The author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n    94→\n    95→### Phenomena (现象)\n    96→\n    97→The author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n    98→\n    99→### Constancy (恒常)\n   100→\n   101→The drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n   102→\n   103→### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n   104→\n   105→The author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n   106→\n   107→### The Poetic (诗意)\n   108→\n   109→The author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n   110→\n   111→\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n   112→\n   113→To make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n   114→\n   115→Readers familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n   116→\n   117→### Dreamscape (梦境)\n   118→\n   119→The author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not necessarily grounded in anything beyond the experience itself, functional within its own terms. (The author does not commit to the Madhyamaka ontology of the Diamond Sutra; the parallel is structural, not doctrinal.)\n   120→\n   121→### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n   122→\n   123→The author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n   124→\n   125→### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n   126→\n   127→In Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n   128→\n   129→A critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n   130→\n   131→The remaining terms depart from common translations for specific reasons: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" rather than the more common \"benevolence\" (following Ames and Rosemont), because the author emphasizes the inner felt experience of fellow-feeling before any outward action -- \"benevolence\" connotes charitable giving, which is too external. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness\" rather than \"righteousness,\" because the author treats it as a motivational disposition (the felt impulse connecting inner feeling to action), not a moralistic or absolutist judgment. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct\" rather than \"rites\" or \"propriety,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension that the author takes as the phenomenal starting point.\n   132→\n   133→The author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument. Readers should watch for the moment when the author shows how an inductively observed *property* (something people happen to have) is silently transformed into a normative *definition* (what people must be) -- this reversal from property to definition is perhaps the collection's most original philosophical move, and it recurs throughout.\n   134→\n   135→Note that the reader will encounter two different English words for the same Chinese character within a single passage: 德 appears as \"virtue\" when quoting Laozi and as \"character\" when the author analyzes the concept. This is deliberate, not an inconsistency -- it reflects the author's argument that the traditional reading (virtue, imposed from above) conceals the constructive process (character, assembled from below).\n   136→\n   137→### Three Realities\n   138→\n   139→The author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n   140→\n   141→- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n   142→- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n   143→- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n   144→\n   145→The numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\" Readers familiar with Kant will notice that Zeroth Reality resembles the *Ding an sich* (thing-in-itself), but with a decisive difference: for Kant, the thing-in-itself is a necessary limiting concept that philosophy cannot do without; for this author, Zeroth Reality is genuinely dispensable -- one can do all of philosophy, and live, without ever invoking it.\n   146→\n   147→### Stable Structures (稳定结构)\n   148→\n   149→Patterns that persist as a Jing evolves over time -- the author's empirical replacement for a priori categories. Where Kant deduces the categories of understanding from the table of judgments, the author treats stable structures as discovered through experience and subject to revision: they are what survives the evolution of a Jing, not what precedes it. In mathematical contexts, these are denoted **S_E**.\n   150→\n   151→### Natural Transformations and Understanding (自然变换 / 理解)\n   152→\n   153→The collection's most technically innovative contribution: the author formalizes \"understanding\" as a natural transformation (a standard concept in category theory) between two Jing-structures. When two people understand each other, or when a reader understands a text, what occurs is a structural alignment -- a systematic mapping that preserves associations. The felt confirmation that understanding has occurred is denoted **eta** (η). When eta is an identity morphism -- when no mediation is needed -- the author calls this **mastery** (掌握, *zhangwo*). This formalization provides a precise, non-mysterious account of intersubjectivity: shared understanding does not require shared inner experience, only structural alignment.\n   154→\n   155→### Other Terms\n   156→\n   157→**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; \"the off-tone\" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n   158→\n   159→A complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n   160→\n   161→---\n   162→\n   163→## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n   164→\n   165→This collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it. This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n   166→\n   167→Three examples, among many:\n   168→\n   169→In Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n   170→\n   171→In Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n   172→\n   173→In Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n   174→\n   175→We have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter. This is not a stylistic preference but a philosophical necessity: if the reader's experience is the evidence for the author's claims, then a translation that preserves the words but fails to produce the experience has lost the argument. In these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n   176→\n   177→---\n   178→\n   179→## A Note on Reading\n   180→\n   181→The author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n   182→\n   183→The three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n   184→\n   185→Readers without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n   186→\n   187→---\n   188→\n   189→*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n   190→\n   191→---\n   192→\n   193→## Glossary\n   194→\n   195→*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n   196→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by practice. The author thinks from within the Chinese philosophical tradition -- drawing on the *Laozi*, the *Yijing*, and the Confucian vocabulary of 仁, 义, 礼, and 德 -- while subjecting that tradition to a radical constructivist reinterpretation. This dual formation -- Chinese philosophical inheritance and scientific training -- is not incidental to the text. Physics concepts recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\nTwo structural claims of the collection deserve advance notice. First, the author treats nihilism not as the negation of metaphysics but as its *consequence*: when metaphysical systems claim to describe ultimate reality and then fail, the void they leave is nihilism. Post-metaphysics is the path that emerges after recognizing this -- not by rejecting metaphysical construction, but by practicing it lucidly. Second, the author treats absurdity not as a permanent human condition (as in Camus) but as a structural collapse: absurdity arises when one's Jing seeks meaning externally and finds none. The dissolution of absurdity -- demonstrated in Essay 3 through the progression from Sisyphus to cat ownership -- is achieved not by revolt but by reconstructing the Jing so that meaning is internally generated.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms -- particularly \"phenomena\" and \"digestion\" -- to their counterparts in the translated essays. Three translator's footnotes within the essay connect its key terms to the formal apparatus of Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not \"mere\" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\nTo make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.\n\nReaders familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not necessarily grounded in anything beyond the experience itself, functional within its own terms. (The author does not commit to the Madhyamaka ontology of the Diamond Sutra; the parallel is structural, not doctrinal.)\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms depart from common translations for specific reasons: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" rather than the more common \"benevolence\" (following Ames and Rosemont), because the author emphasizes the inner felt experience of fellow-feeling before any outward action -- \"benevolence\" connotes charitable giving, which is too external. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness\" rather than \"righteousness,\" because the author treats it as a motivational disposition (the felt impulse connecting inner feeling to action), not a moralistic or absolutist judgment. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct\" rather than \"rites\" or \"propriety,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension that the author takes as the phenomenal starting point.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument. Readers should watch for the moment when the author shows how an inductively observed *property* (something people happen to have) is silently transformed into a normative *definition* (what people must be) -- this reversal from property to definition is perhaps the collection's most original philosophical move, and it recurs throughout.\n\nNote that the reader will encounter two different English words for the same Chinese character within a single passage: 德 appears as \"virtue\" when quoting Laozi and as \"character\" when the author analyzes the concept. This is deliberate, not an inconsistency -- it reflects the author's argument that the traditional reading (virtue, imposed from above) conceals the constructive process (character, assembled from below).\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\" Readers familiar with Kant will notice that Zeroth Reality resembles the *Ding an sich* (thing-in-itself), but with a decisive difference: for Kant, the thing-in-itself is a necessary limiting concept that philosophy cannot do without; for this author, Zeroth Reality is genuinely dispensable -- one can do all of philosophy, and live, without ever invoking it.\n\n### Stable Structures (稳定结构)\n\nPatterns that persist as a Jing evolves over time -- the author's empirical replacement for a priori categories. Where Kant deduces the categories of understanding from the table of judgments, the author treats stable structures as discovered through experience and subject to revision: they are what survives the evolution of a Jing, not what precedes it. In mathematical contexts, these are denoted **S_E**.\n\n### Natural Transformations and Understanding (自然变换 / 理解)\n\nThe collection's most technically innovative contribution: the author formalizes \"understanding\" as a natural transformation (a standard concept in category theory) between two Jing-structures. When two people understand each other, or when a reader understands a text, what occurs is a structural alignment -- a systematic mapping that preserves associations. The felt confirmation that understanding has occurred is denoted **eta** (η). When eta is an identity morphism -- when no mediation is needed -- the author calls this **mastery** (掌握, *zhangwo*). This formalization provides a precise, non-mysterious account of intersubjectivity: shared understanding does not require shared inner experience, only structural alignment.\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"experience\" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; \"the off-tone\" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it. This method has deep roots in the Chinese philosophical tradition -- Mencius's thought experiment of the child at the well (孺子入井) and Zhuangzi's parables function in precisely this way, producing experiential shifts that no purely discursive argument could accomplish.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter. This is not a stylistic preference but a philosophical necessity: if the reader's experience is the evidence for the author's claims, then a translation that preserves the words but fails to produce the experience has lost the argument. In these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n\n---\n\n## Glossary\n\n*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n","numLines":196,"startLine":1,"totalLines":196}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"07814919-1bd1-47c2-a4ae-497c94c51784"}
