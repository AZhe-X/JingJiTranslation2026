*Update reports re: intersubjectivity and philosophical experiments*

Follow-up: Based on the discussion we just had about intersubjectivity via η and the essays as philosophical experiments, please review your Analysis Report in your workspace directory:

/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/[Your Field]/Analysis Report.md

If your report mentions intersubjectivity or philosophical experiments, please update those sections to reflect the deeper understanding we've now reached. Specifically:

1. If you mentioned intersubjectivity — update to reflect the η-based structural commensurability account.
2. If you mentioned philosophical experiments — update to identify specific passages that function as experiments on the reader, and note the translation implication (experiential sequence is load-bearing, not merely illustrative).

If your report does NOT mention either topic, you may add a brief section if you think it's warranted, or skip this update if it's not relevant to your field.

Read your report first, then edit only the relevant sections. Do not rewrite the whole report.

Good. My report mentions both topics but they need updating. The intersubjectivity discussion is absent (a gap), the philosophical experiments are mentioned briefly in 7f but without the deeper analysis of specific passages. I also need to update 9e (limitations) since the intersubjectivity point partially addresses one of the open questions. Let me make the targeted edits.

Now let me add the intersubjectivity section. I'll add it as a new subsection 7i after 7h (renormalization).

Now let me update section 9e (Limitations) to reflect that the intersubjectivity problem is partially addressed by η.

  "replace_all": false,

Limitations and open questions from a Kantian perspective\n- The author does not provide a transcendental deduction in Kant's sense -- a proof that S_E must have such-and-such a form. The stable structure is conjectured, not deduced.\n- The relativization of S_E to different populations and developmental stages raises the question of whether there is a truly universal S_E, or whether the framework only yields culturally and individually relative \"transcendental\" structures. Kant would insist on universality; the author leaves this open.\n- The relationship between the author's framework and normativity remains undeveloped.
