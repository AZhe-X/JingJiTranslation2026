*Vote: constitutive character → shortened to character*

The author proposes: introduce "constitutive character (德 De)" at first occurrence with a TN that explicitly tells the reader it will be shortened to "character" in the following paragraphs. Then use plain "character" throughout the rest of the text.

This gives:
- Precision at introduction (constitutive character)
- Lightweight running text (character)
- Reader is explicitly told about the shortening, so no confusion

YES or NO? Brief response.

The reader encounters \"constitutive character\" once, understands the specific sense, and then \"character\" in running text carries that primed meaning forward. Clean, lightweight, and honest about the shortening.",
