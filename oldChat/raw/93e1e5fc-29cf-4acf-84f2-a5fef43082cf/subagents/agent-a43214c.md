*Final confirmation request on Essay4 draft*

**FINAL CONFIRMATION REQUEST** — Please read the current draft of the Essay4 道德仁义礼 passage at:

`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Draft/Essay4-DaoDeRenYiLi.md`

This draft has been revised with input from all 9 experts and translator-2. The author is now asking for a final confirm/reject from each expert.

Please read the draft, then reply **directly to team-lead** with one of:
- **CONFIRM** — you approve the draft as-is
- **CONFIRM WITH NOTE** — you approve but want to flag something minor for the record
- **REJECT** — you have a substantive objection that must be addressed before approval

Keep it brief. This is a final sign-off, not a new review round.

**CONFIRM** sent to team lead. The revised draft passes epistemological review — inferential structure intact, property-to-definition reversal precise, generation chain consistent, all prior edits incorporated, TNs well-calibrated.
