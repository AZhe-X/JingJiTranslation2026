You're right — the eta-based intersubjectivity account is primarily a philosophy-of-mind contribution. I'll restructure Section B so that:\n\n- The **Kantian parallels** subsection mentions intersubjectivity only in passing (as transcendental conditions for shared experience) and cross-references the Phil-Mind subsection.\n- The **Philosophy of Mind** subsection becomes the home for the full eta/intersubjectivity treatment, including the other-minds argument from Essay 4, the connections to Zahavi/Gallese/Brandom, and the tower-as-meta-cognition model.\n\nThe final proposal already has a dedicated Philosophy of Mind bullet in Section B — I'll ensure the intersubjectivity content is consolidated there rather than split across Kantian and Phil-Mind. Thank you.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"491e7141-5852-4c06-a1e8-194c708a2fcc","timestamp":"2026-02-11T07:48:50.717Z"}
