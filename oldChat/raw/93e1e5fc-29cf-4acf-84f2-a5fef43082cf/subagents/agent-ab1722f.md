*Review draft translation, send feedback to translator-2*

Please review the draft translation of the 道德仁义礼 passage from Essay 4 (后形而上学 整理).

**Original Chinese**: Read the original essay at: /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录/后形而上学 整理.md (lines 18-30 for the passage, and footnotes [^3], [^4], [^24] at lines 136-138, 172)

**Draft translation**: Read /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Draft/Essay4-DaoDeRenYiLi.md

Compare the draft against the original Chinese carefully. Then send your comments, suggestions, agreements, and any concerns **directly to translator-2** via message. Focus on your area of expertise (Wittgenstein/philosophy of language) — the language-game of "explanation" vs "description," the grammar of the phenomenal-X compounds, whether the English prose preserves the logical structure of the argument.

Now let me do a careful comparison of the original Chinese against the draft, focusing on the logical structure of the argument and the language-game of "explanation" vs "description."

Sent my detailed review to translator-2. Ten points covering:

1. **套用 → "projected" or "imposed"** rather than "applied" -- captures the epistemic overreach of template-applying first-person explanations onto third-person observations
2. **Remove parentheses around "can"/"should"** -- use italics for contrastive stress instead; parentheses mute the argument's climactic move
3. **Normative weight of "ought to be"** -- same parentheses issue
4. **"Buried from view"** -- praise, works perfectly
5. **"Pursuing branches, forgetting root"** -- works naturally
6. **Footnote 3** -- well handled, no changes
7. **画纸 → "paper" not "canvas"** -- minor fidelity
8. **TN1 attribution** -- correctly done
9. **TN3 needs universality** -- add 凡事诸物皆有其德 to complete the picture
10. **失 echo** -- optional TN connecting the Laozi's "loss" to the author's "loss of constructive logic"
