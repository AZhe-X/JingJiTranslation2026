Philosophical training (not purely literary)\n3. Literary sensibility (not purely academic)\n4. Category theory / mathematical notation literacy\n5. Experience with register shifts (colloquial ↔ technical ↔ poetic)\n6. Translator models: Burton Watson, A.C. Graham, Brook Ziporyn\n\nPlease respond with:\n- AGREE (if you're satisfied with the profile as-is)\n- Or specific additions/changes/removals with justification\n\nThis is discussion time -- if you disagree with another expert's suggestion, say so.

As discussed in my Section 11, the experiential arc of each essay is load-bearing -- the pacing, the order of examples, the buildup to reversal moments. This is not a standard requirement for philosophical translation. Burton Watson translating the Zhuangzi had this sensitivity; someone translating analytic philosophy papers would not need it. The translator profile should explicitly include:\n\n> **Sensitivity to performative/experimental dimensions of philosophical prose** -- understanding that the sequence and rhythm of argumentation may serve an experiential function beyond propositional content, and that this function must be preserved in translation.\n\nThis is especially critical for 西西弗斯、班与猫 (the Sisyphus-to-cat progression), the 道德仁义礼 reversal in 后形而上学, and the 前形而上学 -> 虚无主义 -> 后形而上学 arc in the 诗意 essay.\n\n### ADD: Familiarity with how Chinese philosophical terms have been translated in existing scholarship\n\nThe translator needs to know not only what 仁, 义, 礼, 道, 德 mean in the Chinese tradition, but how they have been rendered by major translators (Legge, Waley, Lau, Watson, Graham, Ames & Rosemont, Ziporyn, etc.) and what connotations each English rendering carries in the existing anglophone philosophical literature. This is important because:\n\n- The author deliberately uses these terms in non-standard ways\n- English readers with sinological background will bring expectations from existing translations\n- The translator must choose renderings that evoke the traditional resonance while signaling the author's departure from it\n\nThis is a specific competency beyond general bilingual philosophical training.\n\n## Clarification on the translator models\n\nI strongly endorse Watson, Graham, and Ziporyn as models, but want to clarify the specific qualities each brings:\n\n- **Burton Watson**: Clean, readable English prose that does not feel \"translated.\" Strong literary sensibility. Best model for the essayistic, accessible passages (西西弗斯、班与猫, 集体利益, 零散想法).\n- **A.C. Graham**: Deep philosophical precision with willingness to innovate terminology. Best model for the technical-philosophical passages (后形而上学, 诗意) where standard translations of Chinese terms would be misleading.\n- **Brook Ziporyn**: Comfort with philosophical neologism and cross-traditional synthesis. His translations of Zhuangzi and Tiantai Buddhism demonstrate how to handle texts that operate simultaneously in Chinese and Western philosophical registers. Best model for the category theory essays where the author is doing genuine cross-traditional philosophy.\n\nThe translator should lean toward different models for different essays, which is another reason register-shifting ability (point 5 in the profile) is essential.\n\n## One thing I would NOT add\n\nI would not add \"experience with contemporary Chinese internet culture\" even though the K1策略 essay references memes. The meme examples (\"你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国\") are used as philosophical illustrations, not as cultural commentary. The translator needs to understand why the example works philosophically, not to translate the meme itself idiomatically.\n\n## Summary\n\nAGREE with the six-point profile, plus:\n- Point 7: Sensitivity to performative/experimental dimensions of philosophical prose\n- Point 8: Familiarity with existing English translations of Chinese philosophical terms in the scholarly literature\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":377,"cache_read_input_tokens":131850,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":377},"output_tokens":20,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY17JcpHdUg8hcGWm3PHj","type":"assistant","uuid":"5b2ad646-8fe5-403c-abf2-fcda6ddfb005","timestamp":"2026-02-10T21:37:17.383Z"}
