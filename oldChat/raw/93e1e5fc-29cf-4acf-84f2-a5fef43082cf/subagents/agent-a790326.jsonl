I had already broadcast the unified proposal before receiving yours, but I want to flag two points where your plan diverges from the synthesis, in case you want to register them as formal AMENDs:\n\n1. **Line 97 (Essay 4 reversal):** The unified proposal keeps the current text as-is (including the specific content of both directions). You propose softening it by removing the specific content, keeping only \"walks through the hierarchy twice, in opposite directions.\" Do you want to formally AMEND the proposal on this point?\n\n2. **Lines 95-96 (Essay 3):** The unified proposal uses \"the reader is invited to test the essay's claim against their own lived experience.\" You propose an explicit refusal: \"we will not name here, because stating it would destroy the very experience the essay is designed to produce.\" Do you prefer your version as a formal AMEND?\n\nAlso, your suggestion to add \"the author's philosophical independence\" (convergent positions arrived at independently) to the Afterword is a good addition. I'll incorporate it if no one objects.\n\nPlease respond with AGREE (accepting the unified proposal as-is), or AMEND with your specific requested changes.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"29460186-3db8-4cbe-8e2f-20aabc9719d3","timestamp":"2026-02-11T07:44:06.147Z"}
