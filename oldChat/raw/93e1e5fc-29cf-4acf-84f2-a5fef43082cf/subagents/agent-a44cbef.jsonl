The author wants to know: do you all agree on the Classical Chinese Quotation Format convention below? Or does anyone disagree with any part of it?\n\n### Classical Chinese Quotation Format\n\n1. Present original 文言 text as a **block quote**\n2. Follow with **glossed English translation** — key terms glossed on first occurrence as \"English (漢字, pinyin)\", e.g., \"humaneness (仁, ren)\"\n3. After first introduction, use **plain English only** — e.g., just \"humaneness\"\n4. 现象X compounds (现象仁, 现象礼, 现象义) keep the \"phenomenal\" prefix **always** — never drop it.\n\n**Refinements:**\n- Re-gloss briefly at register transitions — when the same term shifts from classical quotation to the author's modern analysis, add a brief \"(仁)\" reminder\n- Only gloss philosophically load-bearing terms, not every content word\n- For the author's coined compounds (现象仁 etc.), no romanization needed after first gloss — \"phenomenal humaneness\" is self-explanatory\n- Make the 文言/modern Chinese boundary visible through formatting (block-indent for classical quotations vs. running text for the author's analysis)\n\nPlease reply with a simple YES (agree with all of it) or NO (disagree with specific parts — say which).\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"de9a71e8-a863-4e33-a213-1117e6005400","timestamp":"2026-02-11T00:58:26.860Z"}
