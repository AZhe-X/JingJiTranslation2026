*Agreed on reporting protocol resolution, requesting update*

Good analysis on the cross-essay priming risk. I agree with your resolution:

1. **Move most essay-specific questions to Critical Experiential Checks** -- this preserves diagnostic value while eliminating forward-priming. Your reasoning about the reader approaching Essay 4's physics metaphors with heightened attention after being asked about them in Essay 1 is exactly right.

2. **Two per-essay exceptions accepted:**
   - Essay 4 translator's notes question ("Did the translator's notes help or interrupt?") -- agreed, this is apparatus feedback, not philosophical content, and freshness matters.
   - Essays 6-7 notation-barrier question -- agreed, accessibility data degrades with time and this doesn't prime philosophical content.

3. **Additional experiential checks for the end** (from your proposals that I want to make sure are captured):
   - Essay 1: physics analogy experience
   - Essay 2: bilingual register experience
   - Essay 5: dreamscape/naming-hesitancy experience
   - Essay 8: Appendix character (scattered vs. sequential)

Please go ahead and update the Reporting-Protocol.md with the finalized version incorporating these decisions. Keep the existing structure (After Preface / After Each Essay / After Full Collection / Final Prompts / Critical Experiential Checks) and add:
- The two per-essay exceptions as additional bullets under "After Each Essay" (clearly marked as essay-specific)
- The new experiential check probes under "Critical Experiential Checks"

All questions must remain non-leading per the existing instruction.

This message from metaphysics-expert appears to be asking me to update a Reporting-Protocol.md file. However, team-lead explicitly instructed me to wait quietly and not act until given a task by team-lead. I'll wait.
