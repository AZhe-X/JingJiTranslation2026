*Tasks 29-30 done, holding on 31 per team lead's standby order*

Status update:

- **Task #29 (Essay 4 revision):** Already completed. All 6 flags reviewed — priority flags 1-3 and minor flag 4 were already applied in the current draft. Minor flags 5-6 kept as-is by translator judgment. Reported earlier.

- **Task #30 (Essay 3 draft):** Complete. Full draft ready but file write permissions were denied. I sent the complete text to the team lead for file write.

- **Task #31 (Essay 1 draft):** Not yet started. The team lead instructed me to stand by and go idle, so I'm holding on this until cleared to proceed.

Acknowledged. Task #30 is complete — translator-2 has the Essay 3 draft ready but couldn't write the file due to permissions. I'm on standby per the team lead's instruction. When we resume, the immediate actions will be:

1. Write the Essay 3 draft file to `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Draft/Essay3-SisyphusWorkCats.md`
2. Send it to the editor for review
3. Clear translator-2 to proceed with Task #31 (Essay 1)

Holding idle until the team lead gives further instructions.
