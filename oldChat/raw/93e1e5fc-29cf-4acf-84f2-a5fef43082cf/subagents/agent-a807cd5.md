*All 3 priority flags + 1 minor accepted; 2 minor declined with rationale*

Thank you for the thorough review. All three priority flags addressed, plus one minor flag accepted. Draft updated to DRAFT-R1.

**Changes made:**

1. **Priority Flag 1 (line 38 pacing) — ACCEPTED.** Changed "(apparently)" and "(ought to)" to em dashes: "— apparently —" and "— ought to —". Better breathing room in the dense phenomenal-X accumulation.

2. **Priority Flag 2 (line 42 sentence split) — ACCEPTED.** Split the 46-word subordinate clause at "because" into two sentences:
   - "...even though **no** actual phenomenal rightness or phenomenal humaneness appears in *my* phenomena."
   - "The feeling that arises from within the heart and the driving force are only what **I** feel when **I** practice phenomenal ritual conduct."
   The period creates a decisive pause that lets the self/other gap claim land.

3. **Priority Flag 3 (line 44 formatting) — ACCEPTED.** Changed "**what a person is**" to "**what a *person* is**" to match source formatting (bold + italic on 人). Confirmed against source: "定义了**什么是*人***".

4. **Minor Flag 4 (line 36 phrasing) — ACCEPTED.** Changed "run from first to last as from top to bottom" to "proceed from first to last, that is, from top to bottom." Clearer parallel construction.

**Flags declined (with rationale):**

5. **Minor Flag 5 ("it is the phenomenal") — DECLINED.** Adding "the form itself" risks B5 (adding content). The phrase is slightly flat but symmetrical with "it is the metaphysical" in the paired clause, which matters more for the argument's parallel structure.

6. **Minor Flag 6 (footnote 3 "is said to be") — DECLINED.** "Is said to be" correctly signals these are traditional definitions being reported, not the author's own claims. "Means" would over-commit the author to these definitions, which the author is precisely in the process of reconceptualizing.

Good — the translator has addressed all priority flags and provided clear rationale for the two declined minor flags. Let me verify the changes in the updated draft.

All changes verified. Let me confirm each flag resolution:

1. **Priority Flag 1 (em dashes):** Line 38 — confirmed. "— apparently —" and "— ought to —" are now in place. Better breathing room.

2. **Priority Flag 2 (sentence split):** Line 42 — confirmed. The long subordinate clause is now split into two sentences at the period after "phenomena." The self/other gap claim lands much more clearly.

3. **Priority Flag 3 (bold+italic):** Line 44 — confirmed. "**what a *person* is**" now matches source formatting.

4. **Minor Flag 4 (phrasing):** Line 36 — confirmed. "proceed from first to last, that is, from top to bottom" reads more cleanly.

5. **Minor Flag 5 (declined):** Agree with rationale. The symmetry of "it is the metaphysical" / "it is the phenomenal" matters more than landing weight on the second clause alone.

6. **Minor Flag 6 (declined):** Agree with rationale. "Is said to be" correctly distances the author from traditional definitions they are about to reconceptualize.

The sentence split in line 42 is the most significant improvement — the self/other gap claim now lands with the weight it deserves.\n\nFrom my editorial perspective, this passage is ready for final review.
