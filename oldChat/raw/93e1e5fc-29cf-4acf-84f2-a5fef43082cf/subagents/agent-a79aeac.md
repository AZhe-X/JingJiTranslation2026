*Requesting Reporting Protocol feedback*

Hi — I'm synthesizing all team feedback on the Reporting Protocol for the Standby Reader. Could you please send me your feedback/suggestions if you haven't already? I need submissions from all experts to create a unified revision plan. Thanks.

Let me know if you didn't receive it or need me to resend.",
