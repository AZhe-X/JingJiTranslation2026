*Load 8+1 essays and your report before feedback*

Reminder: Make sure you have loaded the 8+1 source essays and your own Analysis Report into your context before submitting feedback on the Reporting Protocol. You need the essay content fresh in mind to judge what essay-specific questions would be appropriate (and whether they risk priming the reader).

The team lead wants me to load the source essays and my analysis report before providing feedback. I already sent feedback to the editor, but let me now verify my essay-specific question proposals against the actual essay content. If I find any issues, I'll send a correction to the editor.

Let me load my analysis report and the essays, focusing on the key experiential sequences that my proposed questions target.

Now I have all the source essays fresh in context. Let me verify my proposed essay-specific questions against the actual content, and send a follow-up correction to the editor if any of my questions need adjustment.

After careful review:

1. **Essay 1 question** ("did your sense of 'collective interest' change?") -- Good. The essay genuinely moves the reader from "collective interest doesn't exist" to "it exists as an emergent phenomenon." The question tests whether this ontological shift landed.

2. **Essay 2 question** ("Did the Bob repetition help or feel redundant?") -- Good. The three Bob examples (lines 31-34) are indeed progressively staged: Bob-rejects-based-on-memory, Bob-rejects-based-on-observation-but-deceived, Bob-absorbed-doesn't-notice-at-all. This is a genuine experiential sequence. However, I should note that my question mentions "Bob and the rain" when it's actually "Alice told Bob" -- the reader will encounter it as the Alice-and-Bob rain scenario. Minor point but my question is close enough.

3. **Essay 3 question** ("Of the three examples, which affected you most?") -- This is the one I'm most concerned about. On re-reading, the essay has Sisyphus, then the office worker (上班), then the cat owner. My question says "three examples" which correctly matches. However -- does saying "three examples" itself prime the reader to think of them as a structured set rather than individual reflections? The essay does present them sequentially and the third (cat) is explicitly contrasted. I think "three examples" is neutral enough -- the essay itself makes it obvious there are three.

4. **Essay 4 question** ("Was there a moment where the direction of the argument surprised you?") -- Good. The reversal (lines 26-28 of the Chinese) is the essay's central philosophical move. The question doesn't name it.

5. **Essay 5 question** ("Does 'the poetic' make sense to you?") -- Good. The essay is short and entirely devoted to establishing this concept. If the reader can't articulate it, the essay failed.

6. **Essay 6 question** about mathematical notation -- Good. This directly tests the Translator's Preface claim that "the mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite."

7. **Essay 7 question** ("Was there a passage where you felt you truly understood something versus one where you only followed the words?") -- Good. The essay's core contribution is formalizing the understanding/mastery distinction via eta. This question tests whether the reader experiences that distinction without naming it. However, I notice the meme sentence (line 201 of K1: "你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国") is a critical experiential moment that's already covered in the Critical Experiential Checks. My question for the per-essay stage correctly targets a different aspect.

8. **Appendix question** ("Did this feel like an ending?") -- On re-reading, the Appendix is genuinely scattered -- draft sections, incomplete thoughts, memes (images). It ends with an unfinished draft section. My question is appropriate -- it tests whether the reader experiences closure or fragmentation.

One thing I want to flag to the editor: I notice that the Appendix includes image references (`![[pink-and-forks.jpg]]` and `![[constructed-in-my-head.jpg]]`). The translation will need to handle these meme images. But that's a translation issue, not a reporting protocol issue.

My original feedback stands well after verification against the source texts. Let me send a brief follow-up to the editor confirming this.

Both messages sent to the editor. To summarize what I contributed:

**Original feedback (4 recommendations):**
1. Remove the subtle prime from the per-essay template (line 31) -- the question "Did you feel like the essay was asking you to *experience* something?" tells the reader the collection has an experiential dimension before they discover it themselves. Move to full-collection retrospective.
2. Add 1 essay-specific question per essay, with three strict constraints: backward-looking only, experiential not analytical, limited to 1-2 per essay. Proposed specific questions for all 8 essays.
3. Add a Preface expectation-baseline question.
4. Keep all other structure as-is.

**Follow-up after source verification:** All proposed questions confirmed as well-calibrated against the actual essay content. Flagged the Appendix meme images as a translation issue for later.
