It shares conceptual ground with Heidegger's 'poetic dwelling' (dichterisch wohnen) but emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation.

Specific examples, page references, and fine-grained phrasing will be revised once the full translation exists.\n---\n\n# Translator's Preface\n\n## On the Title\n\nThe title of this collection is 境集 (*Jing Ji*). We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by vocation. This dual formation is not incidental to the text. Physics metaphors recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\nThe collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing meaning-structures) without doing metaphysics (claiming those structures are the ultimate nature of reality). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 with phenomenological weight closer to Husserl's *Erscheinung* or *Phanomen* than to Kant's *Erscheinung*. Phenomena are not \"mere appearances\" behind which a truer reality hides; they are the indubitable starting point, the only reality we have direct access to (First Reality, 第一实在). \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we *seek* in phenomena, not what we find.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. It shares conceptual ground with Heidegger's \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*) but emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not grounded in inherent existence, functional within its own terms.\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author coins 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" (following Ames and Rosemont), emphasizing the inner feeling over the behavioral expression. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness,\" capturing the motivational disposition rather than the moral judgment that \"righteousness\" implies. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument.\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\"\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"lived experience\" (the Chinese equivalent of Erlebnis). **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" (the author's coinage, with this English gloss in the original). **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter -- because in these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n\n---\n\n## Glossary\n\n*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":806,"cache_read_input_tokens":55702,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":806},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY1nM7kgMEwwW6A13aNQi","type":"assistant","uuid":"31a3fc23-94e7-4374-a43e-0216721ca0e4","timestamp":"2026-02-11T06:11:04.138Z"}

Specific examples, page references, and fine-grained phrasing will be revised once the full translation exists.\n---\n\n# Translator's Preface\n\n## On the Title\n\nThe title of this collection is 境集 (*Jing Ji*). We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by vocation. This dual formation is not incidental to the text. Physics metaphors recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\nThe collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing meaning-structures) without doing metaphysics (claiming those structures are the ultimate nature of reality). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 with phenomenological weight closer to Husserl's *Erscheinung* or *Phanomen* than to Kant's *Erscheinung*. Phenomena are not \"mere appearances\" behind which a truer reality hides; they are the indubitable starting point, the only reality we have direct access to (First Reality, 第一实在). \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we *seek* in phenomena, not what we find.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. It shares conceptual ground with Heidegger's \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*) but emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not grounded in inherent existence, functional within its own terms.\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author coins 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" (following Ames and Rosemont), emphasizing the inner feeling over the behavioral expression. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness,\" capturing the motivational disposition rather than the moral judgment that \"righteousness\" implies. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument.\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\"\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"lived experience\" (the Chinese equivalent of Erlebnis). **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" (the author's coinage, with this English gloss in the original). **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation.

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n    13→\n    14→集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n    15→\n    16→No single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n    17→\n    18→The author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n    19→\n    20→We treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n    21→\n    22→The \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n    23→\n    24→---\n    25→\n    26→## The Author\n    27→\n    28→The author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by vocation. This dual formation is not incidental to the text. Physics metaphors recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n    29→\n    30→The author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n    31→\n    32→The collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n    33→\n    34→---\n    35→\n    36→## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n    37→\n    38→The collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n    39→\n    40→- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n    41→- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n    42→- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n    43→\n    44→The division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n    45→\n    46→This is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n    47→\n    48→We recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n    49→\n    50→---\n    51→\n    52→## A Bilingual Collection\n    53→\n    54→One of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n    55→\n    56→We have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n    57→\n    58→We have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n    59→\n    60→---\n    61→\n    62→## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n    63→\n    64→A note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n    65→\n    66→The Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n    67→\n    68→> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n    69→> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n    70→\n    71→In its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n    72→\n    73→The author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n    74→\n    75→This reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n    76→\n    77→A footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n    78→\n    79→---\n    80→\n    81→## Key Terminological Decisions\n    82→\n    83→These essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n    84→\n    85→### Jing (境) and E\n    86→\n    87→As discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n    88→\n    89→### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n    90→\n    91→The author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing meaning-structures) without doing metaphysics (claiming those structures are the ultimate nature of reality). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n    92→\n    93→### Phenomena (现象)\n    94→\n    95→The author uses 现象 with phenomenological weight closer to Husserl's *Erscheinung* or *Phanomen* than to Kant's *Erscheinung*. Phenomena are not \"mere appearances\" behind which a truer reality hides; they are the indubitable starting point, the only reality we have direct access to (First Reality, 第一实在). \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n    96→\n    97→### Constancy (恒常)\n    98→\n    99→The drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we *seek* in phenomena, not what we find.\n   100→\n   101→### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n   102→\n   103→The author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n   104→\n   105→### The Poetic (诗意)\n   106→\n   107→The author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n   108→\n   109→\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. It shares conceptual ground with Heidegger's \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*) but emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n   110→\n   111→### Dreamscape (梦境)\n   112→\n   113→The author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not grounded in inherent existence, functional within its own terms.\n   114→\n   115→### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n   116→\n   117→The author coins 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n   118→\n   119→### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n   120→\n   121→In Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n   122→\n   123→A critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n   124→\n   125→The remaining terms: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" (following Ames and Rosemont), emphasizing the inner feeling over the behavioral expression. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness,\" capturing the motivational disposition rather than the moral judgment that \"righteousness\" implies. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension.\n   126→\n   127→The author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument.\n   128→\n   129→### Three Realities\n   130→\n   131→The author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n   132→\n   133→- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n   134→- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n   135→- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n   136→\n   137→The numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\"\n   138→\n   139→### Other Terms\n   140→\n   141→**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"lived experience\" (the Chinese equivalent of Erlebnis). **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" (the author's coinage, with this English gloss in the original). **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n   142→\n   143→A complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n   144→\n   145→---\n   146→\n   147→## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n   148→\n   149→This collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it.\n   150→\n   151→Three examples, among many:\n   152→\n   153→In Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n   154→\n   155→In Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n   156→\n   157→In Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n   158→\n   159→We have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter -- because in these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n   160→\n   161→---\n   162→\n   163→## A Note on Reading\n   164→\n   165→The author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n   166→\n   167→The three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n   168→\n   169→Readers without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n   170→\n   171→---\n   172→\n   173→*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n   174→\n   175→---\n   176→\n   177→## Glossary\n   178→\n   179→*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n   180→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

We have left it in romanized Chinese.\n\n集 (*ji*) is the most unassuming of Chinese genre markers: it means simply \"collected writings\" -- neither treatise (论) nor canon (经), but a gathering. The weight of the title falls entirely on its first character, 境 (*jing*), which is also the central concept of the collection.\n\nNo single English word captures 境. Its range of meaning includes: a bounded region or domain; a state or condition one is in; a realm of experience; an environment or milieu; a level of attainment or cultivation. In Buddhist usage (translating Sanskrit *visaya* or *gocara*), it refers to the object-domain as structured by the perceiving mind -- not the world \"out there,\" but the world as it shows up for a subject. In Chinese aesthetic theory, 意境 (*yijing*) denotes the experiential world evoked by a work of art. In everyday speech, 处境 is one's situation, 梦境 is a dreamscape, 环境 is an environment, 境界 is a level of realization.\n\nThe author draws on all of these resonances while giving 境 a precise technical meaning: the categorical structure of a subject's experiential field -- the totality of phenomena as organized by the associations, connections, and constructions that link them. A *jing* is not merely what one experiences but *how* one's experiences are structured and related to each other. In the formal essays of the second half of this collection, 境 is denoted by the symbol **E** and given a rigorous characterization using category theory.\n\nWe treat *Jing* as English philosophical readers treat *Dao*, *Dasein*, or *Dharma*: a foreign term that repays learning in its own right, whose productive ambiguity would be collapsed by any single translation. On first occurrence in each essay, it appears as \"Jing (境).\" In mathematical and technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**.\n\nThe \"-scape\" suffix in English performs some of the same work as 境: a landscape, seascape, or dreamscape is not merely a collection of objects but a structured field one can inhabit. Readers may find this echo helpful; the author's compound 梦境 (*mengjing*, dreamscape) makes the resonance explicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Author\n\nThe author of these essays is a physicist by training and a philosopher by vocation. This dual formation is not incidental to the text. Physics metaphors recur throughout -- renormalization, effective field theory, stable structures under evolution -- and they carry philosophical weight, not merely illustrative color. When the author describes collective interest as a \"renormalized\" phenomenon (Essay 1), or knowledge as filtered through the \"detection\" apparatus of individual cognition (Essay 2), or the constancy-seeking drive as analogous to identifying invariants under transformation (Essay 7), the physics is doing genuine philosophical work: it provides structural intuitions that the formal apparatus of the later essays makes precise.\n\nThe author is also mathematically trained, and the second half of the collection deploys category theory as a descriptive language for the structure of experience. Readers without mathematical background should not be deterred: the formal passages are always accompanied by concrete examples -- pens, magic books, cats, coin-flips -- that carry the philosophical content independently. The mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.\n\nThe collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately. They are not oversights awaiting a final polish; they are part of the philosophical honesty of the project -- a thinker's notebook that does not pretend to more completeness than it has. The author's own table of contents warns that the Part 2 essays are \"drafts in progress\" (正在工作中的草稿) and invites readers to skip unfinished sections. We have translated even these, because the shape of an incomplete thought can be as illuminating as a finished one.\n\n---\n\n## The Structure: Fish and Fishing\n\nThe collection is divided into two parts and an appendix:\n\n- **Upper Collection: Fish** (上集：鱼) -- three essays\n- **Lower Collection: Fishing** (下集：渔) -- four essays\n- **Appendix** (附录) -- one essay\n\nThe division alludes to the classical Chinese proverb 授人以鱼不如授人以渔: \"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.\" Part 1 gives the reader fish -- three self-contained reflections on collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity, each demonstrating the author's philosophical method in action without naming it. Part 2 teaches the reader to fish -- it reveals the methodology behind those reflections, developing the concepts of Jing, the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and the categorical formalism that structures them.\n\nThis is not merely an organizing metaphor. The sequencing is philosophically load-bearing. The author prescribes a reading order and recommends against rearrangement. Part 1 provides the reader with concrete philosophical *experiences* -- of recognizing emergent phenomena, of watching justified true belief collapse, of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat. Part 2 then offers the formal apparatus for understanding *why* those experiences occurred and how they can be generalized. The collection enacts the very progression it describes: from phenomena to the structures built upon them.\n\nWe recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order, reading the essays sequentially from first to last.\n\n---\n\n## A Bilingual Collection\n\nOne of the eight essays -- \"A Thought on Knowledge\" (Essay 2) -- was written in English by the author. The remaining seven are in Chinese, and their translation into English constitutes this volume.\n\nWe have not edited the author's English. Essay 2 appears exactly as written, in its original analytic-philosophy register, which is noticeably more formal than the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese essays. This register difference is a feature, not an inconsistency: the collection is deliberately bilingual, and the contrast between the two languages demonstrates something about the nature of Jing itself -- that the same philosophical investigation can be conducted in different experiential media, each with its own texture and affordances.\n\nWe have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms to their counterparts in the translated essays: \"phenomena\" = 现象 (First Reality, **P**); \"digestion\" anticipates the formal functor structure of the later essays; the essay's conclusion -- that knowledge is \"what each individual believes to be correct\" -- foreshadows the knowledge sub-category of the Jing framework. Three translator's footnotes within the essay mark specific terms that receive formal treatment in Part 2.\n\n---\n\n## The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena\n\nA note for readers familiar with classical Chinese philosophy, and for those who will encounter the term 形而上学 (*xingershangxue*, metaphysics) throughout these essays.\n\nThe Chinese word for \"metaphysics\" derives from a passage in the *Xici zhuan* (系辞传, Great Commentary on the *Book of Changes*):\n\n> 形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。\n> \"What is above form is called the Way; what is below form is called implements.\"\n\nIn its traditional reading, 形 (*xing*) refers to visible, tangible, physical form. The passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) that lies above or beyond form, and the concrete implements (器) that lie below or within it. This is typically understood as a cosmological distinction between the metaphysical and the physical.\n\nThe author of these essays reinterprets 形 as 现象 (*xianxiang*): phenomena. This transforms the classical passage from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. \"What is above phenomena\" is the metaphysical -- the concepts, structures, and universals we construct upon our experience. \"What is below phenomena\" is the concrete and particular. The directionality is crucial and is the author's own: phenomena are the *ground*, and the metaphysical is what is built *upon* them, not the other way around.\n\nThis reinterpretation is a significant hermeneutical departure. The author acknowledges it (in Essay 4 and again in the Appendix), noting that it does not perfectly fit the original passage. A Chinese reader familiar with the *Xici zhuan* would notice the departure immediately; an English reader, encountering 形而上学 only through the translation \"metaphysics,\" would not. We flag it here so that the author's originality is visible, and so that readers understand that when these essays speak of \"the metaphysical\" as something built *upon* phenomena, this is a deliberate philosophical position, not simply the standard meaning of the Chinese term.\n\nA footnote at the first occurrence of the *Xici zhuan* passage in Essay 4 provides further detail.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terminological Decisions\n\nThese essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary at the end of this volume provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.\n\n### Jing (境) and E\n\nAs discussed above, the central term is left in romanized Chinese. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.\n\n### The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)\n\nThe author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing meaning-structures) without doing metaphysics (claiming those structures are the ultimate nature of reality). We render the first as \"the metaphysical\" and the second as \"metaphysics,\" and maintain this distinction throughout.\n\n### Phenomena (现象)\n\nThe author uses 现象 with phenomenological weight closer to Husserl's *Erscheinung* or *Phanomen* than to Kant's *Erscheinung*. Phenomena are not \"mere appearances\" behind which a truer reality hides; they are the indubitable starting point, the only reality we have direct access to (First Reality, 第一实在). \"Phenomena\" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.\n\n### Constancy (恒常)\n\nThe drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. \"Constancy\" was chosen over \"permanence\" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), \"regularity\" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and \"invariance\" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we *seek* in phenomena, not what we find.\n\n### The Non-Rational (非理性)\n\nThe author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as \"irrational\" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.\n\n### The Poetic (诗意)\n\nThe author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as \"the Poetic\" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write \"the Aesthetic\" or \"the Sublime\") and \"poetic\" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.\n\n\"The Poetic\" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. It shares conceptual ground with Heidegger's \"poetic dwelling\" (*dichterisch wohnen*) but emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.\n\n### Dreamscape (梦境)\n\nThe author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. \"Dreamscape\" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the \"-scape\" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not grounded in inherent existence, functional within its own terms.\n\n### Vain Presumption (虚妄)\n\nThe author coins 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English \"vain\" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); \"presumption\" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.\n\n### The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence\n\nIn Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.\n\nA critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as \"character\" in the author's analysis, not \"virtue.\" The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as \"virtue\" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.\n\nThe remaining terms: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as \"humaneness\" (following Ames and Rosemont), emphasizing the inner feeling over the behavioral expression. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as \"rightness,\" capturing the motivational disposition rather than the moral judgment that \"righteousness\" implies. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as \"ritual conduct,\" emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension.\n\nThe author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the \"phenomenal\" prefix always attached. The distinction between \"humaneness\" (the classical concept) and \"phenomenal humaneness\" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument.\n\n### Three Realities\n\nThe author introduces a numbered schema of realities:\n\n- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.\n- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.\n- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.\n\nThe numbering is epistemic, not ontological: \"First\" means \"first in the order of our access,\" not \"most fundamental in the order of being.\"\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**联想** (*lianxiang*): \"association\" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): \"feeling\" or \"felt experience\" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): \"lived experience\" (the Chinese equivalent of Erlebnis). **祛魅** (*qumei*): \"disenchantment\" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: \"the off-tone\" (the author's coinage, with this English gloss in the original). **演化**: \"evolution\" (temporal development, not biological).\n\nA complete glossary follows the translated essays.\n\n---\n\n## Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments\n\nThis collection does not merely *argue* for its positions; it *enacts* them. The author designs experiential sequences -- carefully ordered examples, thought experiments, and phenomenological demonstrations -- that produce in the reader the very experiences the essays then analyze. In the author's own terms, these sequences are philosophical experiments: they construct a Jing for the reader and invite the reader to attend to what occurs within it.\n\nThree examples, among many:\n\nIn Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.\n\nIn Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice -- once in the \"understood\" direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the \"actual\" direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way). The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\n\nIn Essay 7, the author presents a Chinese internet meme -- a grammatically plausible but semantically incomprehensible sentence -- alongside the ordinary sentence \"The cat jumped on the table.\" The reader's experience of failing to understand the first sentence while effortlessly understanding the second is a philosophical experiment demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation. In the English translation, we have replaced the Chinese meme with an English sentence that produces the same structural experience (grammatical plausibility, semantic void, recoverable cultural meaning), since a literal translation would produce the experience of \"bad translation\" rather than \"native incomprehensibility\" -- a different structural position entirely. A translator's note cites the original Chinese.\n\nWe have taken great care throughout to preserve these experiential sequences exactly as the author designed them. Where a choice had to be made between literal accuracy and experiential fidelity, we have favored the latter -- because in these essays, the experience *is* the argument.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Reading\n\nThe author recommends reading the essays in the order given, and we echo this recommendation.\n\nThe three essays of Part 1 (Fish) can each be read independently, though they gain from being read in sequence: they progress from ontology (what exists?) through epistemology (what can we know?) to existential meaning (what about the absurd?). Part 2 (Fishing) is more tightly interconnected; the author recommends reading all four essays together before attempting to relate them back to Part 1. The Appendix collects supplementary reflections and is best read last.\n\nReaders without mathematical training may wish to read lightly through the category-theoretic formalism in Essays 6 and 7, attending to the concrete examples while allowing the notation to wash over them. The philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone. Readers with mathematical training will find that the formalism provides genuine structure, not mere decoration.\n\n---\n\n*This preface will be revised upon completion of the full translation.*\n\n---\n\n## Glossary\n\n*[Full glossary to be appended after translation is complete.]*\n","numLines":180,"startLine":1,"totalLines":180}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"9d2c7a13-1598-427a-a8d3-029792567023"}
