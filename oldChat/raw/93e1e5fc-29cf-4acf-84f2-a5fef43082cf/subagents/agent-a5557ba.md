*Asking all experts if any expertise is missing*

Team update: Here are the 8 experts currently on this translation team:

1. Metaphysics / Ontology
2. Phenomenology (Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty)
3. Epistemology
4. Existentialism / Absurdism / Nihilism
5. Philosophy of Mind / Cognitive Science
6. Kantian / Transcendental Philosophy
7. Classical Chinese Philosophy (Confucianism, Daoism, Neo-Confucianism)
8. Buddhism (Madhyamaka, Yogacara, Chan/Zen)

Question for each of you: Given the essays you've read, is there a significant expert perspective MISSING from this team? Or do you think these 8 cover the ground adequately? 

Think about: Are there terms, arguments, or frameworks in the essays that none of us are well-equipped to handle? Would adding a specific expert materially improve the translation quality?

Please respond with your honest assessment.

Sent my assessment to the team lead. The key recommendation: the most significant missing expertise is a **category theorist / philosopher of mathematics** to handle the formal apparatus in Essays 6-7, which is technically precise and load-bearing for the author's philosophical arguments.
