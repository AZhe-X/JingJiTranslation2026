*Review Preface DRAFT-R2 and new Glossary Introduction*

The translator has implemented Option B on the Translator's Preface. Please review both files:

1. **Preface (DRAFT-R2):** `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Draft/Translators-Preface.md`
   - ~2,200 words, 8 sections
   - Terminology moved out, replaced with bridging paragraph
   - Working-draft paragraph cut
   - Bilingual forward references simplified

2. **Glossary Introduction (NEW):** `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Draft/Glossary-Introduction.md`
   - All 13 terminology subsections moved here intact

Please check:
- Does the Preface read as a clean narrative arc now?
- Is the bridging paragraph sufficient (flags 德 split, 形而上/形而上学, Poetic, Non-Rational)?
- Is the Glossary Introduction well-structured as a standalone document?
- Any editorial flags?

Send your review to me.

Review sent. I see new tasks have been created for experts (25-28) — likely related to the Preface/Glossary review cycle. Standing by for next instructions.
