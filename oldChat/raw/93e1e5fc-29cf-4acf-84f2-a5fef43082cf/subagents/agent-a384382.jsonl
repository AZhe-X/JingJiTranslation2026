Here is how I've handled your 9 points:\n\n**Adopted:**\n- Point 5 (义 = \"what ought to be\" not \"what one ought to do\" in fn3): Correct. 所谓义，是谓应当 is broader than action. Changed. The applied example retains \"ought to do\" since the original there has 应当做的.\n- Point 6 (规律 = \"regularity\" not \"pattern\"): Changed to \"general regularity\" in both occurrences (lines 40 and 44). Good call — 规律 carries normative force.\n\n**Flagged to team lead (not adopted yet):**\n- Point 1 (righteousness in block quote): I've recommended against this. The virtue → character shift for 德 is motivated by the author's explicit reconceptualization. No equivalent shift occurs for 义 — the author uses it consistently. A righteousness/rightness split would imply a reconceptualization the author doesn't make. But I've flagged it for editorial decision.\n- Point 3 (signal shift in running text): Deferred. TN3 handles this and an in-text insertion would be editorial interpolation.\n\n**Acknowledged (no changes needed):**\n- Points 2, 4, 7, 8, 9: Noted for full-essay integration. Point 2 (形而上 context) is a continuity note. Point 4 (Analects reference) is minor. Points 7-9 are validated as correct.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"5d249759-18e6-423b-881f-534c5dfbe084","timestamp":"2026-02-11T03:34:21.107Z"}
