*Debate *

The author is considering "character" for 德. Those who voted against it — what is your single strongest objection to "character"? Those who voted for it — what is its single strongest advantage?

Also: we now know 性 does NOT appear as a standalone technical term in the collection, so the "nature" collision concern is off the table.

Brief responses — one strongest point each.

Response sent. My position: "character" is too semantically neutral -- it tells you *that* something has a distinctive quality but not *how* it came to be, which means it fails to signal the constructivist origin that is central to the author's usage of 德. "Constitutive nature" encodes the bottom-up process in the word "constitutive" itself. With the 性 collision confirmed as a non-issue, my vote remains unchanged.
