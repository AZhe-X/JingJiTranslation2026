*Did you notice the ontology→epistemology→existential progression?*

Quick question from the author: The translator noticed a deliberate progression in Part 1:

Essay 1 (ontology of collective vs. individual) → Essay 2 (epistemology: what can the individual know?) → Essay 3 (existential: what about meaning?)

Did any of you notice this progression when reading? Do you agree with this characterization? Brief responses welcome.

I've confirmed the progression and added the epistemological perspective: Essay 2 ("A Thought on Knowledge") functions as the argumentative hinge -- the access argument provides the epistemological license for Essay 3's existential conclusion that meaning must be internally generated. The progression is not just thematic but logically sequential, with each essay supplying premises the next one depends on.
