Background\n\n**Graduate-educated general reader in the humanities or social sciences — but NOT philosophy, mathematics, or physics.** Ideal fields: literature, history, anthropology, linguistics, area studies, law, or similar. Someone who reads serious nonfiction for pleasure and is accustomed to texts that make demands on the reader (e.g., has read Godel Escher Bach, or Pirsig, or Borges, or a good popular science book on quantum mechanics — without being an expert in any of those).\n\n**No formal training in philosophy, category theory, or physics.** A philosophy minor is acceptable; a philosophy major is not. Must never have taken a course in category theory. Some college-level math (calculus, linear algebra) is fine but not necessary.\n\n**Bilingual capability is irrelevant.** The reader should evaluate the English translation on its own terms. If they happen to know Chinese, they should be instructed to ignore the Chinese text entirely.\n\n### 2. What They Must NOT Know\n\nThis is the most important section. The test fails if the reader already knows:\n\n- **The author's theoretical framework.** They must not know in advance that the collection builds toward a category-theoretic formalization of experience. The Fish/Fishing structure is supposed to produce the experience of \"oh, THAT's what was going on in Part 1\" — if they know the punchline, the experiment is ruined.\n- **The specific philosophical positions being argued.** They should not know that Essay 3 dissolves absurdity through the cat example, or that Essay 4 reverses the Dao-De hierarchy. These are meant to be experienced, not anticipated.\n- **Camus's absurdism in detail.** A vague cultural awareness of Sisyphus is fine (and expected). But someone who has closely read The Myth of Sisyphus will approach Essay 3 as a philosophical interlocutor rather than as a reader undergoing the experiential sequence. We need the latter.\n- **Category theory.** Any familiarity with functors, natural transformations, or universal properties will make Essays 6-7 a fundamentally different reading experience. The reader must encounter the formalism cold and report whether the concrete examples (pens, magic books, cats) carry the content independently.\n- **The experts' analysis reports.** Obviously.\n\n### 3. What They SHOULD Know\n\nMinimum requirements for meaningful engagement:\n\n- **Comfortable with abstract ideas.** Not a specialist, but someone who enjoys thinking about \"what is knowledge?\" or \"what makes something the same thing over time?\" as dinner-conversation questions. The collection assumes a reader who finds such questions interesting, not intimidating.\n- **Basic cultural literacy re: Western and Chinese thought.** Should have heard of Confucius, Laozi/the Tao, Socrates, Kant (by name, not by doctrine). Should know that Buddhism exists and involves something about suffering and enlightenment. Should know who Sisyphus is (the boulder, the hill, the punishment). Does NOT need to know the Xici zhuan, the Daodejing in detail, JTB, or Husserlian phenomenology.\n- **Tolerance for foreign terms.** Must be comfortable with a text that uses romanized Chinese terms (Jing, Dao, De, Ren) the way English-language philosophy uses Dasein or Dharma. If they find untranslated terms pretentious or alienating, they are the wrong reader.\n- **Comfort with mathematical notation existing on the page.** They don't need to follow the proofs, but they must not be the kind of reader who skips an entire chapter because it contains symbols. The test is whether they can get the philosophical content through the examples WHILE the notation is present — not whether they can get the content after the notation has been removed.\n\n### 4. Reading Instructions\n\nThe reader should be given the following instructions (and ONLY these — no additional framing):\n\n> You are reading a draft English translation of a Chinese philosophical essay collection titled *Jing Ji* (境集). The collection has two parts and an appendix. Please read the essays in order, from first to last, without skipping ahead or reading out of sequence. Read at your natural pace — there is no time pressure.\n>\n> After each essay, pause and write a brief response (a paragraph or two) addressing:\n> - What you think the essay was about / what it was trying to show\n> - What moments stood out — where you felt something click, or felt confused, or felt surprised\n> - Whether anything felt unclear, and if so, whether the unclarity felt like \"I don't understand yet\" or \"this is badly written\"\n> - Any terms or references you didn't recognize\n>\n> After finishing the entire collection, write a final response addressing:\n> - How the two parts relate to each other\n> - Whether the reading order mattered — did later essays change how you understood earlier ones?\n> - What you would tell a friend this collection is about\n\n**What we are testing with these prompts:**\n\n- The per-essay responses test whether experiential sequences produce their intended effects (recognition, surprise, reversal).\n- The \"click / confused / surprised\" prompt tests whether the philosophical experiments land.\n- The \"I don't understand yet\" vs. \"this is badly written\" distinction tests whether our translation preserves the productive difficulty of the original vs. introducing translator-induced obscurity.\n- The \"unrecognized terms\" prompt tests whether our glossing apparatus is sufficient.\n- The final \"how do the two parts relate\" tests whether the Fish/Fishing structure works.\n- The \"tell a friend\" prompt tests whether the collection's core ideas are communicable after one reading.\n\n### 5. Personality / Disposition\n\n**Curious, patient, honest, and unselfconscious about what they don't know.**\n\n- **Curious** — willing to follow an unfamiliar argument to see where it goes, rather than dismissing it at the first sign of difficulty.\n- **Patient** — willing to sit with a passage that doesn't immediately make sense, trusting that the text may clarify itself later. This is essential for the Fish/Fishing structure to work.\n- **Honest** — willing to report \"I didn't understand this\" or \"this felt pretentious\" or \"I was bored here\" without diplomatic softening. We need the real response, not a polite one.\n- **Unselfconscious** — not worried about appearing ignorant. The worst possible reader for this role is someone who pretends to understand what they don't, or who performs sophisticated engagement rather than reporting genuine experience.\n- **NOT contrarian or skeptical by default.** A reader who approaches every philosophical text looking for flaws will not undergo the experiential sequences — they will be too busy armoring themselves against persuasion. We need someone who reads *with* the text first and evaluates *after*.\n- **Ideally: someone who reads literary fiction.** The sensibility trained by reading novels — attention to sequence, comfort with ambiguity, willingness to inhabit another perspective — is closer to what this collection demands than the sensibility trained by reading analytic philosophy papers.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe ideal standby reader is a well-read, intellectually curious non-specialist — someone who reads the New Yorker and the London Review of Books, has browsed pop-philosophy but never studied it formally, enjoys thought experiments, tolerates foreign terminology, doesn't panic at mathematical symbols, and will honestly report what they experience rather than what they think they should experience.
