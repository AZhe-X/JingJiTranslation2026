*Is *

The author asks: would translating 德 as "virtue" risk large misleading interpretations for readers of 境集?

Context: Chinese-phil-expert recommends "virtue" as the default (it's the mainstream sinological standard), with "potency" in specifically Daoist passages, and a glossary/TN explaining the wider senses (moral virtue → natural potency → inherent character).

But the author's usage is constructivist — 德 in 境集 is not purely Confucian moral virtue nor purely Daoist natural potency. The worry: does "virtue" carry so much moral baggage in English that it would actively mislead readers about what the author means?

Please assess:
1. How misleading is "virtue" for 德 in this author's specific philosophical context?
2. Would an alternative (e.g., "de" romanized, "character," "potency") be less misleading, or would it create other problems?
3. Is the TN/glossary sufficient to correct any misleading impression, or is the word itself too loaded?

Give your honest assessment — the author wants to know if "virtue" is safe or dangerous here.

Let me check exactly how 德 is used in the source texts to see what work the word is doing in the author's framework.

This is extremely clear. Now I can give a precise answer.

  "content": "**\"Virtue\" is dangerous here. Do not use it as the main translation. Use romanized \"De\" with a gloss.**\n\nHere is why, grounded in the author's actual text:\n\n**1. The author's 德 is not moral virtue.**\n\nLine 26 of 后形而上学 整理 gives the author's definition explicitly: \"这些定义合起来，便定义了什么是人——也就是'德'，使得人而成为人的东西。\" (\"These definitions taken together define *what a person is* -- that is, 'De,' that which makes a person a person.\") And immediately after: \"凡事诸物皆有其德（我们认为他应该遵守的规律，使得一样东西成为其本身的东西）\" -- \"all things have their De (the pattern we consider it should follow, that which makes a thing what it is).\"\n\nThe author's 德 = **the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is.** This is closer to Aristotle's *essential
