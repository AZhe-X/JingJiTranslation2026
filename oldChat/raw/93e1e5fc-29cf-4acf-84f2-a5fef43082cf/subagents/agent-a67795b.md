I need to verify what's still in my context after the conversation has progressed. Let me check — I read all essays and my Analysis Report earlier in this session. Given context compression may have occurred, let me confirm by checking if I can reference specific content.

I have the following in my active context from earlier reads:
- Essay 1 (集体利益): renormalization, collective interest
- Essay 2 (A Thought on Knowledge): JTB, belief, phenomena
- Essay 3 (西西弗斯、班与猫): Sisyphus, office worker, cat
- Essay 4 (后形而上学 整理): dao-de-ren-yi-li, 形而上, 第一实在
- Essay 5 (形而上学后的目的：诗意): dreamscape, intoxicated/lucid
- Essay 6 (范畴论与境 整理): category theory, E, P, tower structure, Ship of Theseus
- Essay 7 (范畴论与境：K1策略): evolution functor T, natural transformation eta, stable structure S_E
- Essay 8 (关于诗意和境的一些零散想法): Kantian question, coin-flip, death
- Index (境集): Fish/Fishing structure
- My Analysis Report: all 9 sections (Kantian parallels, S_E, meaning question, synthetic a priori, etc.)
