*Update reports re: intersubjectivity and philosophical experiments*

Follow-up: Based on the discussion we just had about intersubjectivity via η and the essays as philosophical experiments, please review your Analysis Report in your workspace directory:

/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/[Your Field]/Analysis Report.md

If your report mentions intersubjectivity or philosophical experiments, please update those sections to reflect the deeper understanding we've now reached. Specifically:

1. If you mentioned intersubjectivity — update to reflect the η-based structural commensurability account.
2. If you mentioned philosophical experiments — update to identify specific passages that function as experiments on the reader, and note the translation implication (experiential sequence is load-bearing, not merely illustrative).

If your report does NOT mention either topic, you may add a brief section if you think it's warranted, or skip this update if it's not relevant to your field.

Read your report first, then edit only the relevant sections. Do not rewrite the whole report.

Let me read the current report first.

The report does not currently mention intersubjectivity or philosophical experiments. Both are highly relevant to existentialism. I'll add two new sections -- one on intersubjectivity and one on the essays as philosophical experiments -- before the conclusion in Section 7.

Report updated and team lead notified. The two new sections (G and H) have been added to the Overall Significance section, covering intersubjectivity via the natural transformation and the essays as philosophical experiments with specific passage identifications and translation implications.
