*梦境 contains 境 — should translation preserve this link?*

Question from the author: 梦境 contains the character 境 — the same 境 as in the title 境集 and the central concept 境 (Jing). But "dreamscape" (and most proposed translations) doesn't capture this connection. The reader of the English text would not see that 梦境 literally contains 境.

Does this matter? Should the translation of 梦境 somehow preserve the 境 connection? If so, how?

Brief responses welcome. This is a real translation problem.

I've sent my response arguing that the 梦境/境 connection is epistemologically essential (it marks the progression from the motivating experiential case to the formal categorical framework) and proposed three translation options ranked by preference: "dream-jing" with a note (scholarly), consistent English rendering like "dream-realm" (if 境 is also translated), or "dreamscape" with an explanatory note (accessible). The key point: losing the connection silently is not acceptable.
