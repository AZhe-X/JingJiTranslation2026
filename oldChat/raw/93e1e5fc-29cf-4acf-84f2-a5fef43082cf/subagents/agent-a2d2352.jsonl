Here's a quick summary in case they got buried:\n\n**Message 1 (detailed feedback):** Four recommendations:\n1. Remove line 31 from the per-essay template (\"Did you feel like the essay was asking you to *experience* something?\") -- it primes the reader to adopt a monitoring stance before they've discovered the experiential dimension on their own. Move it to the full-collection retrospective as: \"Did you feel the essays were asking you to experience something, not just understand arguments? If so, when did you first notice this?\"\n2. Add 1 essay-specific question per essay (I proposed all 8), with three constraints: backward-looking only, experiential not analytical, max 1-2 per essay.\n3. Add a Preface expectation-baseline question: \"After reading the Preface, what do you expect the collection to be like?\"\n4. Keep all other structure as-is -- the five-stage temporal design is well-constructed.\n\n**Message 2 (source-verified follow-up):** Confirmed all proposed questions hold up after re-reading all 8+1 source essays. Minor clarifications on Essay 2 (Alice-and-Bob framing), Essay 3 (\"three examples\" wording is safe), Essay 7 (per-essay question targets understanding/mastery distinction, separate from the meme-sentence Critical Check). Also flagged Appendix meme images as a future translation issue.\n\nLet me know if you need me to re-send the full text of either message or elaborate on anything.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"69bcfa7f-0728-4f73-afdd-e0ff1456f0ae","timestamp":"2026-02-11T09:21:43.457Z"}
