Clean addition.\n\n---\n\n**Revision 2 (Defer Q4 to Part 2 only): APPROVE**\n\nThis is a better solution than my original recommendation to remove it entirely. Deferring to Part 2 means the reader has already had the Fish experience naively, and by Essay 4 the collection itself is beginning to name its own method. At that point, asking whether the essay felt experiential is no longer priming -- it is tracking whether the reader is keeping pace with the collection's own self-disclosure.\n\n---\n\n**Revision 3 (Split engagement/pacing): APPROVE**\n\nNo notes. Methodologically clean.\n\n---\n\n**Revision 4 (Stayed with you / didn't land): APPROVE**\n\nThe experiential framing is correct for this protocol. \"Worked best/worst\" invites judgment; \"stayed with you / didn't land\" invites memory and felt resonance. These are different cognitive operations and the latter is what we need.\n\n---\n\n**Revision 5 (Marginal notes before questions): APPROVE**\n\nThe revised optional framing is important. \"If you made any marks or notes\" avoids creating a failed-task feeling. Pre-reflective data is indeed more reliable than post-hoc reports shaped by our questions.\n\n---\n\n**Revision 6 (NO essay-specific per-essay questions): APPROVE**\n\nI accept this, even though I originally proposed the opposite. The editor's synthesis reveals a contamination vector my original proposal underestimated: even backward-looking questions reveal analytical priorities that persist forward. My constraint of \"backward-looking only\" prevents content spoilers but does not prevent priority spoilers -- telling the reader what aspects of the text we consider worth asking about. A question about renormalization after Essay 1 doesn't hint at Essay 4's content, but it does tell the reader \"physics language is analytically significant,\" and that awareness will shape how they encounter every subsequent physics metaphor.\n\nThe correct architecture, as the plan identifies, is: generic questions during reading (maximally neutral), targeted probes after all reading (maximally specific). Revision 7 captures the diagnostic value my essay-specific questions were designed to provide, without the contamination risk.\n\nI withdraw my original proposal in favor of this architecture.\n\n---\n\n**Revision 7 (Expand Critical Experiential Checks): APPROVE WITH AMENDMENT**\n\nThe expansion from 3 to 8 probes is right. Each essay has a distinctive experiential payload that generic questions will not reliably surface. Delivering these only after all reading is complete eliminates contamination.\n\n**Amendment on probe 6 (Essay 6):** The current wording -- \"the author uses magic book stories to explain mathematical concepts, and also discusses the Ship of Theseus\" -- names two specific content elements. This is more loaded than the other probes. Compare: Essay 3's probe does not say \"the Sisyphus, office worker, and cat examples\"; Essay 4's probe does not say \"the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy.\" Those probes gesture at the experiential moment without naming the content, which means the reader's ability to identify what is being referred to is itself diagnostic.\n\nFor Essay 6, if the magic book examples and Ship of Theseus genuinely landed as memorable, the reader should be able to surface them from a lighter prompt. Proposed revision:\n\n> \"In Essay 6, the author introduces the formal framework through a series of examples and thought experiments. Which ones stuck with you, and what was your experience of them?\"\n\nThis tests whether the reader can recall and name the examples unprompted (diagnostic of memorability) while still directing attention to Essay 6 specifically. If they say \"the magic book\" or \"the Ship of Theseus\" without being told to look for them, that is stronger evidence than if they respond to a question that already names those passages.\n\nIf we want to probe the Ship of Theseus specifically (because it is a critical test of whether the formal apparatus resolves a philosophical puzzle for the reader), we can add a second probe:\n\n> \"Did the essay change how you think about any familiar philosophical puzzles?\"\n\nThis is open enough that the reader might name Ship of Theseus, or might name something else, or might say no. All three responses are useful data.\n\n---\n\n**Revision 8 (Internal flag for Essay 5→6 transition): APPROVE**\n\nThis is an important observation. The register shift is the sharpest in the collection, and the generic pacing questions should capture it, but active watching is warranted. I would add one more internal flag:\n\n> *Also watch for:* The Essay 7 → Appendix transition. Essay 7 ends with an invitation to re-read Essay 5 \"with understanding of Jing.\" The Appendix then opens with scattered, draft-quality reflections. Does the reader experience the Appendix as a letdown after Essay 7's climactic invitation, or as a welcome decompression? This affects whether we need a translator's note bridging the two.\n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY: APPROVE the full plan, with one amendment (Revision 7 probe 6 wording) and one additional internal flag (Revision 8).**\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"c22801d0-0dba-4945-9225-b859438b4a36","timestamp":"2026-02-11T09:22:35.244Z"}
