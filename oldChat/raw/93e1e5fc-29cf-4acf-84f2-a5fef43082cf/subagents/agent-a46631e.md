*Quick vote: 虚无 context-dependent or fixed default?*

**QUICK VOTE: 虚无 (xūwú) — Disagreement #7**

The current recommendation is: use **"nothingness"** or **"the void"** depending on context, with both acceptable. Key rule: NEVER use "emptiness" (reserved for Buddhist 空/sunyata).

Do you agree with this context-dependent approach (both acceptable, translator chooses based on passage), or do you want ONE fixed default?

Reply to team-lead: **CONFIRM** (context-dependent, both acceptable) or **OBJECTION** (with your preferred single default and reasoning).

  "content": "**CONFIRM** -- context-dependent, both acceptable.\n\nBrief reasoning: 虚无 does different philosophical work in different passages. When the author discusses 虚无主义 (nihilism) and the collapse of metaphysical value hierarchies, \"nothingness\" is the right choice -- it captures the absence that follows the loss of 终极实在 (ultimate reality). When 虚无 appears in more ontological/cosmological contexts as the condition prior to or beneath all determination, \"the void\" better conveys spatial/structural emptiness without the nihilistic connotation.\n\nForcing a single default would flatten a real distinction in the author's usage. The translator needs the freedom to choose.\n\nAnd yes -- \"emptiness\" must be reserved for 空/sunyata. No

**CONFIRM** sent. Context-dependent rendering for 虚无 approved -- "nothingness" for nihilistic/value-collapse contexts, "the void" for ontological/structural contexts, with "emptiness" strictly reserved for Buddhist 空/sunyata.
