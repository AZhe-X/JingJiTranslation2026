*Full edit instructions for translator-2, apply now*

The user has given the go-ahead. Please send the finalized edit instructions to translator-2 now. Include the exact replacement text for all 3 edits:

**Edit 1 (Line 46):**
OLD: "of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat"
NEW: "of confronting the absurd through increasingly familiar examples"

**Edit 2 (Line 50):**
OLD: The entire "Two structural claims..." paragraph
NEW: "The three essays of Part 1 examine, respectively, collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity -- each through a distinctive philosophical method the author does not yet name. The four essays of Part 2 develop the formal framework behind that method: the concepts of the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and a categorical formalism for the structure of experience. The relationship between the two parts is itself part of the argument."

**Edit 3 (Lines 95-96):**
OLD: "In Essay 3, the author arranges three cases..." through "...without destroying it."
NEW: "In Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order, progressing from the mythic to the mundane. The progression itself is the philosophical payload: by the final example, the reader is invited to test the essay's claim against their own experience. The recognition that follows -- which cannot be produced by argument alone -- is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it."

Tell translator-2 to apply these edits, update the YAML header to DRAFT-R3, and confirm when done.
