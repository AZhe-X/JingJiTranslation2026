*形而上: *

Quick question from the author on 形而上 (xing er shang):

The current dictionary entry has the main translation as "the metaphysical" (substantive adjective). The author is asking: should it be "the metaphysical" or "metaphysical object"?

Consider: the author uses 形而上 to refer to constructions built upon phenomena (形/现象) that claim constancy/universality — all Second Reality content. The formal definition: "a metaphysical m is an association in E, and m is a universal property in some subcategory of E."

Which rendering is better and why? Is there a context where one works better than the other? Keep your response concise.

Calling it a \"metaphysical object\" would confuse it with categorical objects (the things in Obj_E). The author's 形而上 is structurally a *property* of a subcategory, not an object in the base category --- even though, due to the tower structure, it also exists as an object at a higher meta-order. \"Metaphysical object\" invites exactly the wrong reading: a thing

Response sent. The key point: "metaphysical object" must be avoided because (1) it creates confusion with categorical objects in the formal framework, and (2) it reifies 形而上 into exactly the kind of standalone entity the author's post-metaphysical framework deconstructs. "The metaphysical" (substantive adjective) is the correct default; "a metaphysical" or "metaphysical construct" when a countable noun is needed.
