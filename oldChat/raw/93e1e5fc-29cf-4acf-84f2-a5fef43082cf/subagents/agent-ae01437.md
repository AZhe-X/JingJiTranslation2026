ALL TEAM MEMBERS:

Follow-up: you all voted NO on "does this work need an introduction from others?" Please give your reason in 1-2 sentences. Why doesn't it need one?

An external introduction would either pre-digest what the text is engineered to produce experientially, or position the work within a tradition that the author deliberately arrives at independently, in both cases undermining the very structure that makes the work philosophically effective.",
