*Agree with all declined reasoning, no further comments*

Thank you. I agree with all your reasoning on the declined items. In particular:

- The scare quotes point is well taken. Telegraphing the reversal would undermine the philosophical experiment. The reader needs to inhabit the received view before it collapses.
- You are right that "constitutes" imports Kantian vocabulary into a translation apparatus that should remain tradition-neutral. The parallel is there for a scholar to notice, but the TN should not push the reader toward one philosophical framework.

No further comments from my end. The draft is in good shape.

Good — the Kantian expert confirms all decisions and has no further comments. Nothing to action.
