Do you understand what kind of book this is?\n- Did it tell you too much, too little, or about the right amount?\n- Is there anything you wish you'd been told, or anything you wish you hadn't been told?\n- Based on the preface alone, what kind of reading experience are you expecting?\n- Is there anything from the Preface that you're now anticipating or looking for in the essays?\n\n---\n\n## After Each Essay\n\n*Deliver after each essay, one at a time. Do not show questions for later essays. Before delivering the questions, request marginal notes first.*\n\n**Step 1 — Marginal notes:**\n> If you made any marks or notes while reading, please share them now — even brief ones.\n\n**Step 2 — General questions (all essays):**\n\n1. What do you think this essay was about?\n2. Was there a moment where something \"clicked\" or shifted for you? Describe it.\n3. Was there anything that confused you? Was it \"I don't understand yet\" or \"this is badly written\"?\n4. How would you describe what this essay was asking you to do — follow an argument? Notice something? Something else?\n5. Did anything in this essay remind you of something from your own life or experience?\n6. Did you want to keep reading after this essay?\n7. Were there any passages where your attention flagged or you had to push through?\n\n**Step 3 — Apparatus questions (specific essays only):**\n\n*Deliver these ONLY for the indicated essays, after the general questions above.*\n\n- **Essay 4 only:** Did the translator's notes help or interrupt your reading?\n- **Essays 6 and 7 only:** Were there passages where the notation felt like a barrier? If so, did the examples nearby help you through?\n\n---\n\n## After Completing the Full Collection (300-600 words)\n\n*Deliver only after the reader has finished all essays and the Appendix.*\n\n- How do the two parts relate to each other? Did the second half change how you understand the first?\n- Which essays stayed with you most, and which felt like they didn't fully land? Why?\n- Did the mathematical passages in Essays 6-7 help, hinder, or not affect your understanding? Did the examples carry the content on their own?\n- Were there terms or concepts you struggled with throughout?\n- Now that you've read everything, did the Preface prepare you well? Was there anything it told you that you wish you'd discovered on your own, or anything it didn't tell you that would have helped?\n\n---\n\n## Final Prompts\n\n*Deliver after the collection-level report above is submitted.*\n\n1. **\"What would you tell a friend this collection is about?\"**\n2. **\"What would you tell a friend it's *like* to read?\"**\n3. **\"Would you recommend it to them? Why or why not?\"**\n\n---\n\n## Critical Experiential Checks\n\n*Deliver ONLY after the final prompts are submitted. These are follow-up probes — the reader must have already reported their general experience before seeing these. Ask them non-leadingly. Do NOT name expected outcomes — ask about the reader's experience. The reader's unprompted response is the data.*\n\n- **Essay 1:** \"In the first essay, there's an extended comparison to physics. How did that land for you?\"\n- **Essay 2:** \"In the second essay, there were three scenarios involving Bob. What stood out to you about them?\"\n- **Essay 3:** \"What happened to your experience across the three examples?\"\n- **Essay 4:** \"When the author walked through the hierarchy twice, what did you notice?\"\n- **Essay 5:** \"When the author described the two kinds of dreamscapes, what came to mind?\"\n- **Essay 6:** \"In Essay 6, the author uses magic book stories to explain mathematical concepts, and also discusses the Ship of Theseus. What was your experience of those passages?\"\n- **Essay 7:** \"When you encountered the two contrasting sentences, what was the difference in your experience of reading them?\"\n- **Appendix:** \"In the Appendix, the author discusses coin-flipping and lists many everyday activities. What was your experience of those passages?\"\n\n**Important:** These questions must be non-leading. Do NOT ask \"Did absurdity dissolve?\" — ask \"What happened to your experience?\" Do NOT name the contrasting sentences in the Essay 7 probe — whether the reader can recall which two sentences are being referred to is itself diagnostic.\n\n---\n\n## Optional: Re-read Test (Essay 3)\n\n*Deliver ONLY after all Critical Experiential Checks are complete. This is an experimental probe — use at the orchestrator's discretion.*\n\n> \"If you re-read just the final example in Essay 3, does it produce the same experience as it did the first time?\"\n\n*This tests whether the experiential sequence is order-dependent (as the author claims). The reader who has been through the full sequence may find the final example still works, or may find the recognition has been absorbed. Either result is informative.*\n\n---\n\n## Internal Analysis Notes\n\n*These notes are for the translation team only. Do NOT deliver to the reader.*\n\n1. **Essay 5 to Essay 6 transition:** This is the sharpest register shift in the collection (poetic-philosophical to mathematical-methodological). Watch Q6 and Q7 in the per-essay reports for Essay 6. If the reader reports losing momentum, flagging attention, or confusion at this boundary, this is important data about whether we need a stronger bridge in the translation apparatus.\n\n2. **Essay 2 register difference:** Essay 2 is the author's original English. The Essay 2 Critical Experiential Check tests whether the bilingual nature of the collection is perceptible. If the reader does NOT notice a register difference, our translation register for the Chinese essays may be too close to analytic-philosophy English — which would mean we've flattened the exploratory, thinking-aloud quality of the Chinese originals.\n\n3. **Marginal notes as primary data:** The reader's marginal notes (requested before per-essay questions) are the least contaminated data source. When analyzing results, weight marginal notes more heavily than retrospective question responses for experiential-sequence effects.\n\n4. **Preface spoiler test:** Compare the reader's \"anticipating or looking for\" response (After Preface, Q5) against their actual per-essay reports. If they anticipated specific outcomes that then occurred, the Preface may still contain residual spoilers despite R3 revisions.\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1268,"cache_read_input_tokens":145293,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":1268},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY1zn6yeCms3sqwekhX8g","type":"assistant","uuid":"0e818846-5bc5-4288-8d32-799116729700","timestamp":"2026-02-11T08:52:31.299Z"}
