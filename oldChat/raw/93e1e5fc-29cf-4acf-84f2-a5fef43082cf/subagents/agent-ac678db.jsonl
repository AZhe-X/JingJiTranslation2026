My reasoning: the Preface currently states \"once in the 'understood' direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the 'actual' direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way).\" This gives the reader the full content of the reversal before they've encountered the essay. The experience of Essay 4 is tracking the bottom-up construction step by step and feeling the accumulated weight invert — the Preface reduces this to pre-delivered information that the reader merely verifies.\n\nProposed text: \"In Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice, in opposite directions. The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect.\"\n\n**Point 2 (Lines 95-96, Essay 3): ACCEPT the unified proposal.**\n\nOn reflection, the unified proposal's version (\"the reader is invited to test the essay's claim against their own lived experience\") is better than my explicit-refusal approach. My version risks being self-conscious and drawing attention to the Preface's own rhetoric rather than the essays. The unified version is more restrained and does the job without meta-commentary. I withdraw my alternative.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"b6f6bb7d-2a6e-4555-b3af-adaf5d80f1a9","timestamp":"2026-02-11T07:51:09.262Z"}
