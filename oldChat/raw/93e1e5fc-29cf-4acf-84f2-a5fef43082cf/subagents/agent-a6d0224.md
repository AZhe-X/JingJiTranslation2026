*Already submitted — confirming key points of earlier feedback*

I already submitted my detailed feedback to you earlier in this session. To confirm you have it — my submission covered:

1. General assessment (protocol is well-designed, staged delivery is correct)
2. Essay-specific questions: Yes, but only as Critical Experiential Checks at the very end. Proposed checks for Essays 1, 2, 5, and 6 (we already have 3, 4, 7).
3. Soften per-essay question line 31 ("Did you feel like the essay was asking you to *experience* something...") — slightly leading; proposed alternative: "How would you describe what this essay was asking you to do — follow an argument? Notice something? Something else?"
4. Add Preface anticipation-detection question: "Is there anything from the Preface that you're now anticipating or looking for in the essays?"
5. Slightly sharpen Essay 7 check to ask about "the difference in your experience of reading them"
6. Consider a re-read prompt for Essay 3 to test order-dependence

If you need me to resend the full text, let me know.
