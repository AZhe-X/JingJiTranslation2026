*Humaneness vs benevolence in Laozi block quote?*

New question about the Laozi block quote translation. We decided to use standard translations in the block quote (Option B). But there's a tension:

Our dictionary has:
- 仁 → "humaneness" (main), "benevolence" (alternative)
- 义 → "rightness" (main), "righteousness" (alternative)  
- 礼 → "ritual conduct" (main), "ritual" / "propriety" (alternatives)

Standard academic translations of the Laozi Ch. 38 passage use:
- 仁 → "benevolence" (Lau, Ivanhoe), "humanity" (Chan)
- 义 → "rectitude" (Lau), "righteousness" (Chan, Ivanhoe)
- 礼 → "rites" (Lau), "propriety" (Chan), "ritual" (Ivanhoe)

For the Laozi block quote specifically, should we:
A) Use standard Laozi translations (benevolence, righteousness, rites/ritual) — then switch to our terms (humaneness, rightness, ritual conduct) in the author's analysis
B) Use our dictionary terms throughout (humaneness, rightness, ritual conduct) — even in the block quote
C) Something else?

Note: we already decided "virtue" in the block quote → "(constitutive) character" in the analysis for 德. The question is whether that same split applies to 仁/义/礼 too.

Brief response.

**Option A** — apply the same logic consistently.

We already decided that the block quote should use standard translations (that's the whole point of Option B from the previous decision). Switching to our dictionary terms for 仁/义/礼 while keeping "virtue" for 德 would be inconsistent — half-standard, half-custom in the same quotation.

**The principle is clean:** when you're quoting a canonical text, you use an established translation. When the author begins their own analysis, they introduce their preferred terminology with explanation.

So the block quote reads:

> "When the Way was lost there was virtue; when virtue was lost there was benevolence; when benevolence was lost there was righteousness; when righteousness was lost there were the rites."

Then the author's analysis introduces: "(constitutive) character (德 *De*)," "humaneness (仁 *Ren*)," "rightness (义 *Yi*)," "ritual conduct (礼 *Li*)" — each with brief justification for the departure from standard renderings, either inline or in TNs.

**This actually creates a productive rhetorical structure:** the reader sees a familiar, accessible translation of the passage, then watches the author systematically reframe each term. It turns the terminological shift into an argument rather than an imposition. The reader understands *why* "benevolence" becomes "humaneness," *why* "righteousness" becomes "rightness," etc.

One practical note: attribute the block quote to a specific translator (I'd suggest Lau — his rendering is the cleanest and most widely recognized). Don't create a hybrid block quote that cherry-picks from multiple translators.

Sent my recommendation. Option A: use standard translations consistently in the block quote (attributed to a single translator like Lau), then introduce our dictionary terms systematically in the author's analysis. Same principle as the 德 decision, applied uniformly.
