*Q7: How prominent a note for 形 = 现象?*

Last question for you — Q7: the translator's note on the author's reinterpretation of 形 as 现象.

In Essay 4 (后形而上学 整理), the author reinterprets 形 in the classical phrase 形而上者谓之道 (from 系辞传). Traditionally, 形 means "visible/manifest form" or "physical shape." The author reinterprets it as 现象 (phenomena in the phenomenological sense).

Your analysis report noted this is a "significant hermeneutical move" — transforming a classical cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. You also noted the author is "honest" about it, acknowledging the reinterpretation doesn't perfectly fit the original.

**My question**: How prominent should the translator's note be?

Options:
1. **Inline note on first occurrence**: "[TN: The author reinterprets 形 (form) in the classical phrase as 现象 (phenomena), transforming the traditional cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one.]"
2. **Footnote only**: A longer explanatory footnote.
3. **Addressed in Translator's Introduction**: A paragraph in the introduction, with only a brief pointer in the text.
4. **No note needed**: The author's own text explains the reinterpretation adequately.

Specifically:
- How jarring would this reinterpretation be to a reader familiar with the Xici zhuan and the traditional reading?
- Does the author's self-awareness (acknowledging the departure) mitigate the need for a translator's note?
- Would a Western reader with NO knowledge of the Xici zhuan even notice that something unusual is happening, or would they just take the author's reading at face value?

The distinction is cosmological/ontological: it divides reality into the intangible-principled and the tangible-concr

Sent my detailed response to the translator. The recommendation is **Option 3 + Option 2 combined**: a paragraph in the Translator's Introduction covering the Xici zhuan baseline and the author's departure, plus a footnote at first occurrence in the text. The key argument is that without a note, the Western reader both misses the author's originality (thinking this is just standard Chinese philosophy) and misrepresents the tradition (thinking the Xici zhuan was doing phenomenology). The author's own acknowledgment helps but is insufficient because it comes late in the essay and is written for a Chinese audience that already has the baseline.
