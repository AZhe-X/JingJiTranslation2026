**Quick question on footnote [^3] — "impels" vs "moves"**

Phenomenology flagged that footnote [^3] still has "impels" while the body text was changed to "moves me to want to."

But the two Chinese originals are different:
- **Body text** (line 24): 使得我**想要**去如何如何地对待他人 — "makes me **want to** treat the other..." → softer, hence "moves me to want to"
- **Footnote [^3]** (line 136): 这个感受使得（**推动**）我去做一些行为 — "this feeling makes (**pushes/impels**) me to do certain things" → stronger, 推动 = push/drive

Should "impels" stay in footnote [^3] since the original Chinese is actually stronger there (推动 vs 想要)? Or should we harmonize to "moves" for consistency?

Reply to team-lead: **KEEP "impels"** or **CHANGE to "moves"**, with brief reasoning.

The difference is authorial, not a translation inconsistency. Harmonizing would erase a distinction the author made.",

**KEEP "impels."** The Chinese originals are genuinely different -- 推动 (push/drive) in the footnote is stronger than 想要 (want to) in the body text. The English correctly mirrors this authorial distinction. Harmonizing would erase it.
