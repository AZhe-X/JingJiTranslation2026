The author refines the format. Instead of "constitutive character" at first occurrence, use:

**(constitutive) character (德 De)**

The parentheses around "constitutive" visually signal that the qualifier is clarifying but will drop away. Then plain "character" in running text thereafter.

Compare:
- Option A: "constitutive character (德 De)" → then "character"
- Option B (author's proposal): "(constitutive) character (德 De)" → then "character"

The difference is subtle but Option B makes the shortening feel built-in from the start — the parentheses tell the reader "this word is here to help you, but it's not part of the term."

YES or NO? Brief response.
