I withdraw my earlier suggestion in favor of this architecture: generic during reading, targeted after all reading is complete. The protocol already has the right structure; I was trying to solve a problem that Revision 7 solves better.\n\nNo amendments needed on any revision. The synthesis is clean.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"71c4c016-3676-4757-aa43-fc76c15ffb18","timestamp":"2026-02-11T09:21:53.252Z"}
