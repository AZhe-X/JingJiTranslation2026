This draft has been revised with input from all 9 experts and translator-2. The author is now asking for a final confirm/reject from each expert.

Please read the draft, then reply **directly to team-lead** with one of:
- **CONFIRM** — you approve the draft as-is

- **REJECT** — you have a substantive objection that must be addressed before approval

Keep it brief. This is a final sign-off, not a new review round.

The philosophical architecture of the passage — bottom-up construction concealed as top-down generation — reads clearly in English. The footnotes and translator's notes are well-calibrated.

**CONFIRM.** The revised draft is approved. It is faithful to the original, applies all conventions, and the two adopted changes (应当 → "what ought to be"; 规律 → "regularity") are properly integrated. No objections.
