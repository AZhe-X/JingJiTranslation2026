*形而上: *

Quick question from the author on 形而上 (xing er shang):

The current dictionary entry has the main translation as "the metaphysical" (substantive adjective). The author is asking: should it be "the metaphysical" or "metaphysical object"?

Consider: the author uses 形而上 to refer to constructions built upon phenomena (形/现象) that claim constancy/universality — all Second Reality content. The formal definition: "a metaphysical m is an association in E, and m is a universal property in some subcategory of E."

Which rendering is better and why? Is there a context where one works better than the other? Keep your response concise.

Response sent. "The metaphysical" is correct -- "metaphysical object" reintroduces the very ontological commitment (svabhava/self-nature) that the author's framework rejects. For the formal definition context where a count noun is needed, "a metaphysical" (following the pattern of "a universal," "a particular") or "a metaphysical construct" as fallback. Standing by.
