A few domain-specific observations, none rising to the level of AMEND:\n\n**On the Preface edits:** All three edits are well-judged. Edit 2's replacement paragraph (\"The relationship between the two parts is itself part of the argument\") is particularly good -- it performs the same function as the original but at a meta-level that preserves the reader's autonomy. Edit 3's removal of the specific case list (Sisyphus, office worker, cat) is the right call; the essay title already does enough teasing.\n\n**On the Afterword, Section B (Cross-Traditional Connections), Wittgenstein portion:** The bullet points correctly identify the key resonances. I would add one item to ensure the most significant contribution is not buried: the **intersubjectivity solution via natural transformation eta** deserves its own sub-point under the Wittgenstein heading, not just under the Kantian one. The beetle-in-the-box insight (PI section 293) -- that private content drops out and structural role is what matters -- is given precise mathematical content by the author's naturality condition. This is, in my assessment, the framework's most philosophically productive single move, and it is distinctively Wittgensteinian in motivation even though it goes beyond what Wittgenstein himself achieved. The Afterword should make this connection explicit. (The editor already has the intersubjectivity point under Kantian parallels; I am suggesting it appear under Wittgenstein as well, since it addresses Kripkenstein's rule-following skepticism and the private language argument simultaneously.)\n\n**On Section C (Experiential Method Revisited):** Strong agreement that the self-referential dimension belongs here. One framing suggestion for the drafter: the essays do not merely *describe* philosophical experiments and then separately *perform* them. Rather, the descriptions *are* performances -- explaining the method IS demonstrating it. This collapse of theory and practice is the collection's most Wittgensteinian feature (cf. Tractatus 4.112: \"Philosophy is not a body of doctrine but an activity\"; PI section 133: \"The real discovery is the one that enables me to break off doing philosophy when I want to\"). The Afterword is the right place to name this, since naming it before the reader experiences it would be -- appropriately -- another spoiler.\n\n**On Section E (What Remains Open):** I endorse the inclusion of an honest limits section. From my domain: the framework's individualist starting point may understate the essentially communal character of meaning that Wittgenstein emphasizes (forms of life, agreement in practice). The author addresses intersubjectivity through structural correspondence, but the *starting point* is always the individual subject's E_t. A Wittgensteinian would note that meaning may be constitutively communal in a way that no individual-first framework can fully capture, however sophisticated its intersubjective bridge. This is a productive tension, not a flaw, and the Afterword should present it as such.\n\n**On length (3,000-4,000 words):** Agreed. The cross-traditional section needs room to be suggestive rather than telegraphic. Six traditions in 1,200-1,500 words is already tight; going shorter would risk the very superficiality the editor flags.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"b2a30845-10ed-460f-a56a-cb9f07ff8f15","timestamp":"2026-02-11T07:50:35.928Z"}
