The author proposes a compromise: "constitutive character" for 德.

This combines:
- "Constitutive" (from chinese-phil-expert) — signals constructivism, neutral on innate/constructed, philosophical pedigree
- "Character" (from wittgenstein/existentialism/phil-mind) — avoids 性/nature collision, universal ("the character of water"), no moral baggage

Format: "constitutive character (德 De)" at first occurrence, then "constitutive character" in running text.

Quick vote: YES or NO? If no, say what's better in one sentence.

Voted NO on "constitutive character" -- same weight problem as "constitutive nature." Maintaining my position that plain "character" is the right choice.
