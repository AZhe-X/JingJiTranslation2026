*TN for category theory: *

Question from the author on 范畴 / category theory:

When category theory (范畴论) is first introduced in the translation, should there be a translator's note warning the reader: "not to be confused with Kant's categories (Kategorien)"?

The dictionary already notes the dual usage: (1) Kantian categories (pure concepts of understanding), (2) mathematical category theory (objects and morphisms). The author primarily uses sense (2) but the philosophical overlap with sense (1) is intentional.

Does a TN help orient the reader, or is it unnecessary / patronizing? Would the average philosophically literate English reader be confused by "category theory" appearing in a philosophical text? Keep your response concise.

A \"not to be confused with\" note would be patronizing.\n\nHowever, the author says the overlap is *intentional*. That is worth noting --- not as a disambiguation but as a philosophical observation.
