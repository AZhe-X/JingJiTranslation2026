Since I am the team lead, I need to make decisions about the translation sequence.\n\nLet me think through the optimal order for drafting the remaining essays.\n\n**Translation priority considerations:**\n\n1. **Essay 3 (Sisyphus, Work, and Cats)** — Part 1 essay, standalone, experiential sequence is the most critical to test (the Sisyphus-to-cat gradient). This is also the essay with the optional re-read test in the Reporting Protocol, meaning the standby reader testing depends on it.\n\n2. **Essay 1 (Collective Interest)** — Part 1 essay, standalone, introduces key terms (renormalization, phenomena, effective existence) that recur later.\n\n3. **Essay 4 (Post-Metaphysics)** — We already have the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li passage drafted and reviewed. The rest of Essay 4 is the methodological core. Completing this essay would give us the full terminological foundation for Part 2.\n\n4. **Essay 5 (The Poetic)** — Depends on Essay 4's framework. Introduces dreamscape and the poetic.\n\n5. **Essays 6-7 (Category Theory)** — Most technically demanding. Should come after the conceptual foundation (Essays 4-5) is solid.\n\n6. **Essay 8 (Appendix)** — Last by design.\n\n7. **Essay 2** — Already in English; needs only translator's prefatory note + 3 footnotes.\n\nThe logical translation sequence is: finish Essay 4 first (we already have a passage drafted and reviewed), then Essays 1 and 3 (Part 1, standalone, testable with the standby reader soonest), then Essay 5, then 6-7, then 2's apparatus, then 8.\n\nBut there is also the matter of the editor's review flags on the existing Essay 4 passage.
