*All points already addressed, confirming draft status*

Thank you for the thorough review. All points have been addressed:

1. **"A feeling directed toward the other"** — Already in the draft. This was fixed per the phenomenology expert's earlier review, which made the same point about preserving the author's phenomenological neutrality regarding 对他人感受.

2. **元物理 optional TN** — Deferred to the full-essay integration pass. The preceding paragraph (not in this excerpt) already explains the term, and TN2 touches on the 形/形而上 reinterpretation. We'll check whether a dedicated note is needed when the full essay is assembled.

3. **All confirmations noted** — Your validation of the staircase metaphor (阶梯), the 失 echo, the property→definition reversal, the "(ought to)" parentheticals, and footnote [^24]'s "determine and generate" is helpful. These all stand as-is in the current draft.

The draft is fully updated with input from all 7 expert reviews.

All clear. Translator-2 confirms the draft already incorporates my key recommendation (the phenomenological neutrality fix on line 38) and the optional 元物理 note is deferred to the full-essay pass. No outstanding issues from the metaphysics review. Standing by for any further tasks.
