*Vote: constitutive character → shortened to character*

The author proposes: introduce "constitutive character (德 De)" at first occurrence with a TN that explicitly tells the reader it will be shortened to "character" in the following paragraphs. Then use plain "character" throughout the rest of the text.

This gives:
- Precision at introduction (constitutive character)
- Lightweight running text (character)
- Reader is explicitly told about the shortening, so no confusion

YES or NO? Brief response.

**YES** — with one small caveat.

The introduce-then-shorten pattern is standard academic practice and solves the readability problem cleanly. The reader gets the full conceptual payload once, the TN anchors it, and "character" carries the weight thereafter without cluttering every sentence.

**The caveat:** "Character" on its own is ambiguous in English (moral character, fictional character, written character, etc.). This is fine as long as:

- The introductory passage makes the specific meaning unmistakable
- The surrounding context in each subsequent use keeps it clear
- If the text shifts topic significantly (e.g., new chapter or section), a brief re-anchoring like "character (德)" appears once to re-orient the reader

This is a lightweight, well-established solution. Good call.

Sent my vote: YES, with the note about re-anchoring "character" at section boundaries since the English word is polysemous.
