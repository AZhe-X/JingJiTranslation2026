I'm currently on standby per team lead's instruction, so I can't apply edits right now. But here are my decisions so I'm ready when cleared:\n\n**Flag 1 (coin-flip spoiler):** Agree — shorten it. Your proposed version is good. Readers who consult the Glossary Introduction mid-reading shouldn't encounter the full mechanism before the Appendix.\n\n**Flag 2 (\"raw\"):** I'd keep it. \"Raw, pre-theoretical ground\" has a directness that matches the author's own register when discussing phenomena — phenomena are the unprocessed starting point, and \"raw\" conveys that. \"Pre-theoretical ground\" alone is slightly too polished for what it's describing. But I won't fight this if you feel strongly.\n\n**Flag 3 (\"Readers should watch for\"):** Keep it. The sentence doesn't reveal what happens, only that something worth noticing does. The priming risk is minimal and the editorial value is high.\n\n**Flag 4 (Other Terms formatting):** Agree — convert to bulleted list. Much more readable.\n\nWill apply all four when file permissions and standby are resolved.\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"398127fe-ff86-4f53-ac28-02def42e33ab","timestamp":"2026-02-11T09:23:10.020Z"}
