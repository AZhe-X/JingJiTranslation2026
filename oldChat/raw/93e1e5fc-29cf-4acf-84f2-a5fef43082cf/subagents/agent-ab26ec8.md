The draft is clean. All 6 changes are properly applied, all conventions are consistent, footnotes and TNs are accurate. Let me do a final verification checklist against the original Chinese.

Key verification points:
- "from within the heart" -- consistent across lines 38, 42, 46. Confirmed.
- "imposed...onto" for 套用 -- line 42. Confirmed.
- "what ought to be" for 应当 in fn3 -- line 54. Confirmed.
- "regularity" for 规律 -- lines 40, 44. Confirmed.
- "enables existence to stand" in fn24 -- line 58. Confirmed.
- "paper" for 画纸 in fn24 -- line 58. Confirmed.
- TN3 universal scope of 德 -- line 68. Confirmed.
- "rightness" consistent throughout including block quote -- line 34. Confirmed per vote.
- Parentheses + bold for (can)/(should) matching author's format -- line 44. Confirmed.
- "directed toward the other" (not "of concern") -- line 38. Confirmed.
- "*generated*" italicized at line 36. Confirmed.
- "*meta-physics*" hyphenated with 元物理 -- line 36. Confirmed.
- "(德)" after first "character" -- line 40. Confirmed.

Everything checks out.
