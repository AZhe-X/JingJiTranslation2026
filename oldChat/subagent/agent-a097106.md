*Vote on Afterword — yes/no/optional, with reasons*

ALL TEAM MEMBERS:

New question from the author: **Since we decided the work doesn't need an external introduction BEFORE the essays, should there be an Afterword AFTER the essays?**

For example, an editor's afterword, a translator's afterword, or a critical afterword that discusses the work's significance, connections to other traditions, etc. — placed AFTER the reader has completed the experiential sequences.

This would avoid the spoiler problem entirely (the reader has already experienced everything) while still providing the scholarly positioning, cross-traditional connections, and critical context that a Foreword would have provided.

Vote:
- **YES** — include an Afterword (say what kind)
- **NO** — not needed
- **OPTIONAL** — nice to have but not necessary

Brief reason (1-2 sentences).

The reader will have already formed their own experience of the text; the Afterword then enriches that experie
