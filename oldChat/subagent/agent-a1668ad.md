*Asking about standard translation of 德*

The author is asking about 德 (de). They've decided to follow the established 文言 convention (block quote original → glossed English → plain English thereafter), so the question is simpler now: what is the standard English translation of 德 in classical Chinese philosophy scholarship?

Context from the disagreement summary:
- Metaphysics expert suggested: virtue / power / de (context-dependent)
- You previously suggested: De (romanized) / inherent character
- Buddhism expert suggested: virtue / potency or efficacy

The tension: 德 has different meanings in Confucian (moral virtue), Daoist (natural potency/efficacy), and the author's constructivist contexts.

What is the standard, accepted translation in mainstream sinological and comparative philosophy scholarship? Is there a default that most translators use, or is it always context-dependent?

Response sent. My recommendation: **"virtue"** as the default rendering for 德, since it is the most widely recognized translation across the field (Legge, Waley, Lau, Slingerland all use it). The heavy lifting is done by the glossary entry and context-sensitive adjustments:

- First occurrence: "virtue (德, *de*)" with a TN noting the full semantic range
- In Daoist-specific passages: shift to "potency (德)" where 德 clearly means natural efficacy rather than moral excellence
- Avoid "power" (dated, suggests coercion)
- The glossary entry matters more than the translation word itself for a term this polysemous
