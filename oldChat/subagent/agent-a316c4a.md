**Quick question on footnote [^3] — "impels" vs "moves"**

Phenomenology flagged that footnote [^3] still has "impels" while the body text was changed to "moves me to want to."

But the two Chinese originals are different:
- **Body text** (line 24): 使得我**想要**去如何如何地对待他人 — "makes me **want to** treat the other..." → softer, hence "moves me to want to"
- **Footnote [^3]** (line 136): 这个感受使得（**推动**）我去做一些行为 — "this feeling makes (**pushes/impels**) me to do certain things" → stronger, 推动 = push/drive

Should "impels" stay in footnote [^3] since the original Chinese is actually stronger there (推动 vs 想要)? Or should we harmonize to "moves" for consistency?

Reply to team-lead: **KEEP "impels"** or **CHANGE to "moves"**, with brief reasoning.

The author chose different words deliberately — the footnote is explicating the structural role of 义 as a connecting force between feeling and action, where the stronger \"impels\" is appropriate. The body text is narrating the lived experience, where the softer \"moves me to want to\" fits. Harmonizing would erase a real distinction in the original.",

Voted to keep "impels" in footnote [^3] — the Chinese originals use genuinely different words (推动 vs 想要) and the translation should preserve that distinction. Waiting for further instructions.
