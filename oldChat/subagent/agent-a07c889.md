*Buddhism expert analysis of 虚妄: NOT Buddhist usage, recommends *

### 1. Confirming: the author's 虚妄 is NOT the Buddhist 虚妄

**Confirmed. These are distinct usages, and the risk of conflation is real and must be guarded against.**

**Buddhist 虚妄.** In Buddhist Chinese, 虚妄 (Sanskrit: *mṛṣā*, *vitatha*, or loosely *māyā*) means "illusory, false, unreal" -- characterizing the nature of phenomena or cognition. Key usages:

- 虚妄分别 (*abhūta-parikalpa* / *vitatha-vikalpa*): "false discrimination" -- the Yogacara term for the cognitive activity that projects imagined natures onto the dependently arisen. This is a technical term for a specific cognitive error.
- The Heart Sutra's 远离颠倒梦想 uses 梦想 (dream-thinking) and 颠倒 (inversion/viparyāsa) in the same semantic neighborhood. 妄 in Buddhist usage is about *cognitive error regarding the nature of reality* -- taking what is empty for substantial, taking what is impermanent for permanent.
- Crucially, Buddhist 虚妄 is *descriptive of how things are experienced* (i.e., our cognition is 虚妄 because it projects inherent existence where there is none). It is NOT a moral judgment about the person experiencing it.

**The author's 虚妄.** The author's footnote makes the divergence explicit:
- 虚 = without real significance (没有实在意义的) -- this is close to the Buddhist sense of 虚 (empty/insubstantial)
- 妄 = arrogant, self-deceptive (自大且自我蒙蔽的) -- this is NOT the Buddhist sense. Buddhist 妄 is *error*, not *arrogance*. The author's 妄 adds a moral-existential dimension: the person who claims to reject all meaning is not merely mistaken but *presumptuous* -- they pretend to occupy a standpoint (outside all dreamscapes) that is impossible for a feeling being.

So: the author's 虚妄 shares the 虚 component with Buddhist usage (insubstantiality) but diverges sharply on 妄 (arrogant pretension vs. cognitive error). The compound as a whole describes a *stance* (the radical nihilist's posture), not a *condition* (the nature of cognition).

**Risk of conflation.** High for any reader with Buddhist background. If 虚妄 is rendered as "delusion" or "illusion," a Buddhist-literate reader will immediately read it as *mṛṣā/vitatha* -- cognitive error about the nature of reality -- and completely miss the author's point about arrogant pretension. This would be a serious mistranslation because the author is *critiquing* the nihilist, not describing a universal cognitive condition.

### 2. Recommended rendering: "vain presumption"

Of your five options, **"vain presumption"** is the best. Here is my assessment of each:

**"delusion"** -- Reject. As you noted, this is *moha* (痴) or *viparyāsa* (颠倒) in Buddhist English. It implies passive cognitive error. The author's 虚妄 is an *active stance* -- the nihilist *claims* to stand outside meaning. "Delusion" makes it sound like something that happens to you; the author means something you do to yourself through arrogance.

**"vain presumption"** -- Recommend. "Vain" captures 虚 beautifully: it means both "empty/without substance" (vain effort, in vain) AND "conceited/self-important" (vanity, vainglory). This double meaning in English mirrors the author's double meaning in Chinese. "Presumption" captures 妄 as arrogance: to presume is to claim a right or position one does not actually hold. "Vain presumption" together means: an empty, self-important claim to a standpoint one cannot actually occupy. This is exactly the author's meaning. The slight archaism is appropriate -- the author's own register in this passage is elevated and deliberate (this is the essay on poeticality, not the cat essay).

**"vain delusion"** -- Reject. Not merely redundant but actively confusing: "delusion" pulls toward the Buddhist reading, "vain" tries to pull away from it. The reader would not know which connotation to trust.

**"presumptuous emptiness"** -- Reject. Awkward, and "emptiness" is the most dangerous word in any text with Buddhist resonances. 空 (sunyata) = emptiness is THE central Buddhist concept. Using "emptiness" here would create a false link between the nihilist's stance and sunyata, which is precisely the conflation the author's entire post-metaphysical framework is designed to prevent.

**"hollow arrogance"** -- Close but wrong register. "Hollow" captures 虚 but sounds colloquial/journalistic ("hollow promises," "hollow victory"). The author's footnote is precise and philosophical. "Hollow arrogance" belongs in a newspaper editorial, not a philosophical essay on poeticality.

### Additional note for the translator

Since the author provides their own footnote defining 虚妄, I would recommend preserving the footnote in translation and rendering it something like:

> *虚妄*: a term coined by the author. 虚 (*xū*): without real substance; 妄 (*wàng*): arrogant and self-deceptive. Here translated as "vain presumption" -- the empty pretension of claiming to stand outside all meaning-structures. Note: this is distinct from the Buddhist term 虚妄 (*mṛṣā*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption.

This preempts the conflation problem directly. Any reader with Buddhist training will appreciate the disambiguation; any reader without it will simply register the definition and move on.
