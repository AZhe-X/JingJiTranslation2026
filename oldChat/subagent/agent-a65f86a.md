*All 3 phenomenology concerns addressed — edits made*

Thank you for the careful review. All three concerns are well-taken and I've made the edits:

1. **"concern for the other" → "directed toward the other"** — agreed, the original 对他人感受 is phenomenally descriptive (a feeling *toward* the other), not ethically specified. My rendering imported Levinasian content that isn't in the source.

2. **"impels" → "moves me to want to"** — agreed, 使得我想要去 has the 想要 (want to) that I dropped. "Impels" erases the volitional/motivational quality and substitutes causal force.

3. **"manifests" → "is exhibited"** — agreed, 体现 is observational (displayed in behavior), not metaphysical (revealing from a hidden source).

Also updated TN2 per your suggestion to note that the author's own preceding paragraph already does the explanatory work.

Good catches — all three were cases where I unconsciously imported theoretical commitments (ethical, causal, metaphysical) that the author's phenomenal register deliberately avoids.

Good to hear — all three edits address the core issue cleanly. The draft should now stay consistently in the phenomenal register throughout.
