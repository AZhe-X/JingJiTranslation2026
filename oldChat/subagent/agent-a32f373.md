*Hybrid: Jing footnoted as *

The author proposes a hybrid solution for the 境/梦境 link:

- 境 stays as **Jing** (romanized, primary term)
- But when first introducing Jing, a footnote glosses it with a "-scape" coinage — something like "living-scape" — establishing that **-scape = 境** in the reader's mind
- Then 梦境 = **"dreamscape"** naturally contains the -scape root, and the reader sees the connection: dream-**scape** contains **-scape** = 境

This way:
- "dreamscape" stays natural and readable (Camp B wins)
- The morphological link is visible (Camp A wins)
- The -scape family works: dreamscape, and any other 境-compounds

Question: Does this work? And what would be the best "-scape" gloss for 境 in the footnote? "Living-scape"? "Experience-scape"? Something else? Brief responses.

This is a genuinely elegant solution. Let me think about the right "-scape" gloss.

The Buddhism expert already proposed "scape" as an alternative. Good -- this confirms the intuition has independent support. Now let me think about which compound works best.

It is better than my translator's-note-only approach because it makes the connection *visible in the text itself* rather than requiring the reader to remember a footnote. The reader who encounters \"dreamscape\" after seeing \"-scape = Jing\" gets the morphological link automatically, the same way the Chinese reader gets 梦 + 境 automatically.\n\nFor the \"-scape\" gloss, my recommendation: **\"experiential scape\"** -- but used only once, in the footnote, as a descriptive gloss, not as a competing translation. Here is my reasoning on the candidates:\n\n**Against \"living-scape\"**: \"Living\" is ambiguous in English -- does it mean \"alive\" or \"dwelling/inhabiting\"?

Waiting for the team lead's response on the "-scape" gloss recommendation.
