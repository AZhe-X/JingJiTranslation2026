*Check 境界 occurrences in source texts — traditional or technical?*

Follow-up question from the author on 境界: Since 境界 also contains 境, we need to check whether the -scape link should apply here too, or whether 境界 is used in its traditional sense (boundary/realm/level of attainment).

Could you check where 境界 actually appears in the original essays and assess: is the author using 境界 in a way that connects to the technical concept 境, or in its traditional/conventional sense? Does the 境 inside 境界 matter the same way the 境 inside 梦境 matters?

The source texts are at:
/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录/
/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/22 随笔/

Please check the actual occurrences and give your assessment. Brief responses welcome.

Let me read the full lines that were omitted to see the context properly.

Sent my assessment. Key findings: 境界 appears only in 范畴论与境 整理 (three times), the author uses it in the boundary/limit sense and explicitly connects it to 境 in the line 25 parenthetical. I recommend translating it as "horizon" with a footnote explaining it as "the boundary (界) of a *jing* (境)," which preserves the connection without forcing the -scape pattern.
