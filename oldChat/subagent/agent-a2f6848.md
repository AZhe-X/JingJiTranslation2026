*Debate: righteousness vs rightness for 义*

Debate request: "righteousness" vs "rightness" for 义 (yi).

Current dictionary: "rightness" (main), based on Chinese-phil-expert's recommendation that "righteousness is too moralistic."

The author treats 义 as the motivational bridge between inner feeling (仁) and outward action (礼) — a 推动力 (driving force). Not purely moral judgment but the impulse that moves you from feeling to action.

Standard Laozi translations use "righteousness" (Chan, Ivanhoe) or "rectitude" (Lau).

We just established that the block quote needs English words with semantic weight — words the reader FEELS — so the philosophical experiment works. "Righteousness" carries heavy moral-religious associations in English (biblical righteousness, self-righteousness, righteous anger). "Rightness" is lighter, more neutral, closer to "correctness."

Question: Which serves the translation better?
- "Righteousness" — more loaded, more to deconstruct, standard in Laozi translations
- "Rightness" — less moralistic, closer to the author's usage as motivational bridge rather than moral judgment

Debate. Brief responses.

Argued for **"rightness"** over "righteousness." The key distinction: we want semantic weight that loads in the *correct* direction. "Righteousness" loads toward moral judgment and religious authority, which the author is not deconstructing. "Rightness" loads toward a felt sense of correctness — which IS what the author deconstructs (a motivational push that gets generalized and imposed). Also flagged the register mismatch: "righteousness" sounds archaic/biblical next to the modern/neutral "humaneness."
