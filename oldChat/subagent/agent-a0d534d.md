*Swap 道德仁义礼 for Western example?*

The author asks: should we swap the 道德仁义礼 example entirely for a more Western metaphysics example? The thinking is that if 德 requires this much translation apparatus (constitutive character, TNs, glosses, etc.), maybe the whole passage would work better with a Western example that English readers already understand — and keep the Chinese example only in a TN or appendix.

What do you think? Is this a good idea or a bad idea? Brief response.

Responded: **bad idea.** Four reasons — the example IS the argument (not a swappable illustration), the author explicitly says it's not a Laozi interpretation but a structural example, the translation apparatus is exactly what the 文言 convention handles, and swapping an author's example for a translator-invented one crosses from translation into rewriting.
