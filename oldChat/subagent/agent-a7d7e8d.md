*Flag: Essay 3 probe still says *

The protocol looks excellent. One remaining issue I want to flag:

**Essay 3 Critical Check (line 84):** "What happened to your experience across the three examples?"

This still says "three examples." The essay contains four stages: Sisyphus, the office worker, the entrepreneur, and the cat owner. The entrepreneur is the pivot (structurally identical labor to the office worker, but no absurdity because the meaning is internal). A reader might segment the essay as three examples (grouping office worker and entrepreneur) or four (separating them). Saying "three" imposes a segmentation that may not match theirs, which undermines the non-leading principle stated in line 91.

I recommend changing to:

> "What happened to your experience across the examples in Essay 3?"

This is a minor wording change that makes the probe genuinely non-leading about how the reader parsed the essay's structure. Whether they say "three" or "four" or describe them differently is itself data.

Everything else looks right. The Essay 2 probe was resolved well via the Bob-scenarios approach, with the register test handled indirectly through Internal Analysis Note #2. The overall architecture is sound.
