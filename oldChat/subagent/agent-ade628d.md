*Confirming 诗意 resolution: *

The author endorses the current resolution for 诗意 (shiyi):

- **"the poetic"** as the standard substantive form
- **"poetic"** as adjective
- **"poeticality"** acceptable as an occasional variant noun
- **Capitalize "the Poetic"** in the translator's introduction and glossary to signal philosophical weight

Does everyone still agree with this resolution? Any second thoughts now that we've been through the full dictionary discussion? Concise yes/no + any brief additions.

Yes, I still agree with this resolution. No second thoughts.

One brief addition from the Chinese philosophy angle: 诗意 carries resonances with the classical Chinese understanding of 诗 (shi) as not merely verse but a mode of disclosing reality -- as in the *Shijing* tradition where poetry is understood as 言志 (yan zhi, "expressing intent/orientation"). The choice of "the poetic" over "poeticality" as the default is right precisely because it preserves this ontological weight. "Poeticality" risks sounding like a property of texts rather than a mode of being-in-the-world, which is how the author almost certainly intends it given the Heideggerian context.

The capitalization convention ("the Poetic" in glossary/introduction, "the poetic" in running text) is clean and follows established precedent for substantivized adjectives in philosophical translation (cf. "the Beautiful," "the Sublime").

Confirmation sent. The 诗意 resolution stands -- "the poetic" as default, capitalized "the Poetic" in glossary/introduction, with the classical Chinese resonances of 诗 as reality-disclosure further supporting this choice.
