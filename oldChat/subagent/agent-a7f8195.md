*Process remaining 8 expert reviews*

Phenomenology is done — good work on those 3 edits. You still have feedback from 8 more experts to process: metaphysics, epistemology, existentialism, phil-mind, kantian, chinese-phil, buddhism, and wittgenstein. Please continue working through their comments. 

One note: chinese-phil-expert's item #1 (wanting "righteousness" in the block quote) contradicts our earlier 9-1 vote that the 仁/义/礼 split applies ONLY to 德. Our decision was "rightness" throughout. You can disregard that point.

For the rest, use your judgment — make edits where you agree, push back where you disagree, and flag anything you want escalated to the author.

I don't see the other 8 expert reviews in my messages yet -- I've only received the phenomenology and epistemology reviews. Let me check if there are messages I may have missed.

[tool: SendMessage]

  "type": "message",
  "recipient": "team-lead",
  "content": "I've processed the phenomenology and epistemology expert reviews (both done -- 7 edits total across the two). However, I don't have messages from the other 7 experts yet. I only received reviews from phenomenology-expert and epistemology-expert. Could you check whether the remaining expert reviews have been sent to me? I'm ready to process them as soon as they arrive.",
  "summary": "Only received 2 of 9 expert reviews — waiting for remaining 7"
