*Buddhism expert recommends *

**Recommendation: "dreamscape" is correct. Keep it.**

Here is my reasoning from the Buddhist translation perspective.

### The Diamond Sutra connection favors "dreamscape"

The Diamond Sutra's 如夢 (like a dream) uses dream as a *simile* (upama/譬喻), not a literal identification. The point is structural: conditioned phenomena share specific properties with dreams -- they are (1) experientially real while occurring, (2) not grounded in inherent existence, (3) functional within their own terms. The Sanskrit *svapna* in the sutra's famous six similes (dream, illusion, bubble, shadow, dew, lightning) specifically evokes an experience that is *fully immersive while it lasts* but recognized as constructed upon reflection.

"Dreamscape" preserves exactly this structure. The "-scape" suffix does critical work: it signals a *constructed environment* (as in landscape, seascape, soundscape) rather than the *experience of dreaming per se*. A dreamscape is a place you can be *in*, with its own topology and logic. This is precisely what the author means by 梦境 -- a structured environment of meaning that one inhabits.

### Why the alternatives are worse

**"Dream-realm"** -- The problem is "realm." In Buddhist translation, "realm" has been heavily claimed by *loka* (世界), *dhatu* (界, as in 三界/three realms), and *gati* (趣, as in the six realms of rebirth). Using "dream-realm" would activate these associations for any reader with Buddhist background, suggesting a cosmological location (like the *svapna-loka*, a dream-world in some Hindu/Buddhist cosmologies). The author's 梦境 is not a place in a cosmology; it is a mode of engagement with meaning-structures. "Realm" is too ontologically heavy.

**"Dream-sphere"** -- The Sloterdijk echo is a problem, not a benefit. Sloterdijk's "spheres" are about shared atmospheric spaces of co-existence (immunological metaphor). The author's 梦境 is about individual experiential structuring. The resonance would mislead readers familiar with Sloterdijk and mean nothing to those who are not.

**"Experiential milieu"** -- Accurate but dead. This loses the entire poetic-performative dimension. The author chose 梦境 *because* it is evocative, not despite it. The dream metaphor is not decorative; it carries philosophical weight (the 沉醉/清醒 distinction depends on it). Stripping the dream metaphor in translation would be like translating the Diamond Sutra's 如夢幻泡影 as "all conditioned phenomena lack inherent existence" -- technically correct, experientially empty.

### The Dali/surreal worry is manageable

Yes, "dreamscape" in English can evoke surrealist fantasy. But context controls this. Once the reader encounters the author's definition -- games, books, rituals, the experience of raising a cat -- the surrealist association will fade within a paragraph. The 沉醉/清醒 distinction further disciplines the reading: "intoxicated dreamscape" and "lucid dreamscape" immediately signal that this is about *modes of awareness within* a constructed environment, not about psychedelic imagery.

Compare: when a Buddhist teacher says "life is like a dream," no one pictures Salvador Dali. The context makes the meaning clear. The same will happen here.

### One additional Buddhist consideration

The Chinese 梦境 is itself a compound: 梦 (dream) + 境 (the same character that becomes the author's technical term E). So 梦境 literally means "dream-境" -- a 境 that has the character of a dream. This internal connection to the author's central concept is important. "Dreamscape" preserves it through the "-scape" suffix, which evokes "experiential landscape" -- close enough to 境 as "experiential structure" that the connection is felt even if not made explicit. None of the alternatives preserve this internal link as well.

### Summary

"Dreamscape" is the right choice. It preserves the Buddhist dream-simile structure (immersive, functional, not ultimately grounded), signals a constructed environment via "-scape," avoids the cosmological baggage of "realm," maintains the poetic register the author intended, and implicitly connects to the author's central concept 境. The surrealist connotation is real but contextually controlled.
