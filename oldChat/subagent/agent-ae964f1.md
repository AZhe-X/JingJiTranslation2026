*Hybrid: *

Follow-up from the author on 前形而上学:

Proposed compromise: **"traditional metaphysics"** as the main translation, with a TN on first occurrence glossing it as **"pre-nihilist metaphysics"** — i.e., metaphysics as practiced before the nihilistic crisis.

This way:
- Main text uses the author's own gloss ("traditional metaphysics") — natural, accessible
- TN specifies the actual dividing line: "pre-nihilist" — so the reader knows what "traditional" is relative to
- The structural pairing with 后形而上学 ("post-metaphysics") is preserved in the main text, and the TN makes the nihilism connection explicit

Does this hybrid work? Concise yes/no + brief reasoning.

The reader who needs it gets it; the reader who does not skips the footnote. No information is lost, no unwanted associations are introduced.\n\nNo objections.\n"
