*Final confirm on 道德仁义礼 terminology*

**FINAL CONFIRMATION — 道德仁义礼 terminology usage**

Before we move on, the author wants a final sign-off specifically on how the five key terms 道/德/仁/义/礼 are rendered in this draft. Please confirm you approve the following usage:

1. **道 (dao)** → "the Way" throughout (block quote and analysis)
2. **德 (de)** → SPLIT: "virtue" in Laozi block quote → "(constitutive) character" / "character" in analysis
3. **仁 (ren)** → "humaneness" throughout (no split)
4. **义 (yi)** → "rightness" throughout (no split)
5. **礼 (li)** → "ritual conduct" throughout (no split)
6. **现象X** → "phenomenal X" for all five when in phenomenal compounds

Reply to team-lead: **CONFIRM** or **OBJECTION** (with specifics).

The whole passage demonstrates how 德 undergoes a transformation — from \"virtue\" (the received metaphysical sense in the Laozi) to \"character\" (the author's reconstructed, bottom-up sense). The split enacts in translation exactly what the passage argues.\n3. **仁 → \"humaneness\"**: Right choice. \"Benevolence\" implies top-down bestowal; \"humaneness\" keeps the connection to what-it-is-to-be-human, which is precisely what the passage puts under pressure (the property-to-de

**CONFIRM** sent. All six terminology decisions approved — no objections from the existentialist perspective.
