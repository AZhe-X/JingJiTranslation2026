*梦境 contains 境 — should translation preserve this link?*

Question from the author: 梦境 contains the character 境 — the same 境 as in the title 境集 and the central concept 境 (Jing). But "dreamscape" (and most proposed translations) doesn't capture this connection. The reader of the English text would not see that 梦境 literally contains 境.

Does this matter? Should the translation of 梦境 somehow preserve the 境 connection? If so, how?

Brief responses welcome. This is a real translation problem.

Sent my recommendation. The core principle: whatever we use for 境, 梦境 should visibly contain it, because the retrospective recognition that 梦境 was always a species of 境 is part of the collection's philosophical experiment on the reader. I prefer "dream-jing" if we commit to leaving 境 untranslated as *jing*.
