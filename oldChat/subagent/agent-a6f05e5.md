*Hybrid: Jing footnoted as *

The author proposes a hybrid solution for the 境/梦境 link:

- 境 stays as **Jing** (romanized, primary term)
- But when first introducing Jing, a footnote glosses it with a "-scape" coinage — something like "living-scape" — establishing that **-scape = 境** in the reader's mind
- Then 梦境 = **"dreamscape"** naturally contains the -scape root, and the reader sees the connection: dream-**scape** contains **-scape** = 境

This way:
- "dreamscape" stays natural and readable (Camp B wins)
- The morphological link is visible (Camp A wins)
- The -scape family works: dreamscape, and any other 境-compounds

Question: Does this work? And what would be the best "-scape" gloss for 境 in the footnote? "Living-scape"? "Experience-scape"? Something else? Brief responses.

The problem is that 境 is the *genus*, and any specific X-scape is already a species. Coining a generic \"-scape\" for the genus risks creating a clunky term that competes with *Jing* rather than supporting it.\n\n**My recommendation: Do not coin a compound.

Sent my recommendation: skip the forced neologism, just use a footnote that teaches the reader to hear "-scape" as the English echo of 境, using the familiar word "landscape" as the key example. This preserves the morphological link naturally without creating an awkward coinage.
