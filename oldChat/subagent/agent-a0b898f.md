*STV vote: who should write the translation*

VOTE REQUEST: Who should do the main writing/translation of the 境集 essays?

We need to decide who will be the primary translator/writer. Please cast a Single Transferable Vote (STV) by ranking your preferences. The candidates are:

1. metaphysics-expert
2. phenomenology-expert
3. epistemology-expert
4. existentialism-expert
5. phil-mind-expert
6. kantian-expert
7. chinese-phil-expert
8. buddhism-expert
9. wittgenstein-expert
10. NEW: a dedicated Writer/Translator agent (if you vote for this, specify what kind of writer -- e.g., literary translator, philosophical translator, bilingual stylist, etc.)

Please respond with:
- Your ranked ballot (1st choice, 2nd choice, 3rd choice, etc. -- rank as many as you want)
- A brief justification for your top choice
- Whether you self-recommend, and why or why not

Remember: the writer will do the actual English prose of the translation, consulting all experts' dictionaries and reports. They need strong English prose, philosophical sensitivity, AND ability to handle the Chinese source text.

Vote submitted. My top choice is a dedicated bilingual philosophical translator with literary sensibility, to avoid the risk of any domain expert over-interpreting through their own tradition's lens. Second choice is chinese-phil-expert for source-text command. I did not self-recommend but ranked myself third as a fallback, given phenomenology's broad overlap with the author's framework. Standing by.
