*Debate: intoxicated vs absorbed vs immersed for 沉醉*

The author wants a focused debate on the translation of 沉醉 / 沉醉的梦境:

Current split:
- **"intoxicated"** (metaphysics, existentialism, chinese-phil, buddhism) — preserves the Chinese metaphor (沉=sink, 醉=drunk), Buddhist resonance (mada, clouded awareness)
- **"absorbed"** (phenomenology) — more neutral, closer to Heidegger's Verfallen
- **"immersed"** (wittgenstein, phil-mind) — neutral, captures the "sunk-in" quality without pejorative connotation

The key tension: "intoxicated" is faithful to the source metaphor but carries negative connotations in English (implies impairment, poor judgment). "Absorbed" and "immersed" are neutral but lose the 醉 (drunk) component.

Please debate this among yourselves. Make your case, respond to the other positions, and see if you can reach consensus. Is the pejorative connotation of "intoxicated" a feature (the author IS describing a state of unknowing) or a bug (the author is not morally condemning pre-metaphysical existence)?

The governing metaphor is lucid dreaming: 清醒 = lucid/awake, 沉醉 = its opposite. In the lucid dreaming framework, the opposite of lucidity is not neutral absorption or immersion -- it is a state where *you do not know you are dreaming*. \"Intoxicated\" captures this epistemic dimension: the intoxicated person's judgment is genuinely altered, they genuinely do not perceive their situation accurately. \"Absorbed\" and \"immersed\" do not capture this.
