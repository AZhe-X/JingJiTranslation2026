The author proposes a compromise: "constitutive character" for 德.

This combines:
- "Constitutive" (from chinese-phil-expert) — signals constructivism, neutral on innate/constructed, philosophical pedigree
- "Character" (from wittgenstein/existentialism/phil-mind) — avoids 性/nature collision, universal ("the character of water"), no moral baggage

Format: "constitutive character (德 De)" at first occurrence, then "constitutive character" in running text.

Quick vote: YES or NO? If no, say what's better in one sentence.

NO to "constitutive character" in running text. Same objection as before -- two-word terms create friction when recurring heavily. If we use "constitutive character" at all, it should be the first-occurrence gloss only, with bare "character" in running text.
