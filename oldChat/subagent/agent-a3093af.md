*Format for classical Chinese quotes: original + glossed English + plain English after?*

Question from the author about rendering classical Chinese (文言) quotations in the translation:

Proposed format: When a classical Chinese passage is quoted (e.g., from the Yijing, Lunyu, Daodejing, or the author's own 道德仁义礼 sequence analysis), the translation would:

1. **Present the original Chinese text** (文言)
2. **Follow with English translation** that includes inline romanization and Chinese for key terms on first occurrence — e.g., "humaneness (仁, ren)" — and later uses just the English, e.g., "phenomenal humaneness"
3. **After that first introduction**, use only the English rendering (e.g., "humaneness") in running text

So the reader sees:
- The original 文言 text (preserved)
- An English translation with key terms glossed on first appearance
- Pure English thereafter

Is this a good approach? Does it balance accessibility with fidelity to the source? Any concerns about cluttering the text, or about how to handle terms that appear in both 文言 quotations and the author's own modern Chinese? Keep your response concise.

The reader needs to see that \"phenomenal humaneness\" is the author's coinage built on \"humaneness\" (仁), which was just introduced via the classical quotation. The three-step format handles this naturally: step 1 gives the Laozi quote with 仁, step 2 glosses \"humaneness (仁, ren),\" and then the author's 现象仁 becomes \"phenomenal humaneness\" -- the construction is visible. This is important because the entire argument of 后形而上学

Endorsed the approach. Highlighted that the format naturally supports the 现象仁/现象义/现象礼 coinages (the reader sees the classical term first, then the author's "phenomenal" prefix as a visible construction), and suggested marking the voice transition between classical quotation and the author's modern analysis through a slight register shift in the English.
