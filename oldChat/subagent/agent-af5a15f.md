*Duplicate review, already fully processed*

This is a resend — already processed in full. Quick confirmation of your 5 recommendations:

1. **套用 → "imposed...onto"** — Applied.
2. **Parentheses → italics** — Declined (author's Chinese uses parentheses + bold; our format mirrors the source).
3. **"Paper" for 画纸** — Applied.
4. **失 echo TN** — Deferred (over-annotation risk).
5. **TN3 universality of 德** — Applied (凡事诸物皆有其德 now in TN3).

No further action needed.
