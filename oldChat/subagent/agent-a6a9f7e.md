*经验 and 体验 both *

Follow-up on the 经验 vote. The author (team lead) raises a concern:

If we set 经验 → "experience" as main, then both 经验 AND 体验 have "experience" as their main translation. The full mapping would be:

- 感受 → "feeling" / "felt experience"
- 体验 → "experience"
- 经验 → "experience"
- 感觉 → "sensation"

Two different Chinese terms with the same English main translation. Is this acceptable, or does it create a problem?

If you think it's fine, explain why. If you think it's a problem, what's your solution — should one of them change?

But the alternative — two Chinese terms collapsing into one English word — is worse. The heaviness is manageable because 经验 as a standalone noun appears relatively rarely in the 境集 essays (mostly in section headers like \"经验的总结\" and in K1's epistemological passages). The adjectival 经验性的 becomes simply \"empirical.

Corrected my position — the collision is a real problem. Reverted to **"empirical experience"** for 经验 to maintain four distinct English renderings for four distinct Chinese terms. Standing by.
