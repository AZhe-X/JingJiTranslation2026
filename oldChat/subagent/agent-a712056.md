*Confirming 诗意 resolution: *

The author endorses the current resolution for 诗意 (shiyi):

- **"the poetic"** as the standard substantive form
- **"poetic"** as adjective
- **"poeticality"** acceptable as an occasional variant noun
- **Capitalize "the Poetic"** in the translator's introduction and glossary to signal philosophical weight

Does everyone still agree with this resolution? Any second thoughts now that we've been through the full dictionary discussion? Concise yes/no + any brief additions.

Within the essays, use lowercase \"the poetic\" --- the author's register is deliberately non-grandiose, and capitalization in running text would lend 诗意 a solemnity the author avoids. The cat passage is poetic precisely because it does not announce itself as Poetic.",
  "summary": "Agree — capitalize only in glossary/intro, lowercase in essays to match author's register"
