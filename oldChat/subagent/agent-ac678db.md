*Formal AMEND on Essay 4 reversal; accept unified on Essay 3*

**AMEND** on point 1. **ACCEPT** the unified proposal on point 2.

**Point 1 (Line 97, Essay 4 reversal): Formal AMEND.**

I maintain that the specific content of both directions should be removed. My reasoning: the Preface currently states "once in the 'understood' direction (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness, and so on down to ritual conduct) and once in the 'actual' direction (phenomenal ritual conduct generates the concept of humaneness, which generates the concept of character, which generates the concept of the Way)." This gives the reader the full content of the reversal before they've encountered the essay. The experience of Essay 4 is tracking the bottom-up construction step by step and feeling the accumulated weight invert — the Preface reduces this to pre-delivered information that the reader merely verifies.

Proposed text: "In Essay 4, the author walks through the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li hierarchy twice, in opposite directions. The reader's experience of seeing the entire logical order reverse itself is the essay's central demonstration. The reversal must be experienced sequentially to produce its effect."

**Point 2 (Lines 95-96, Essay 3): ACCEPT the unified proposal.**

On reflection, the unified proposal's version ("the reader is invited to test the essay's claim against their own lived experience") is better than my explicit-refusal approach. My version risks being self-conscious and drawing attention to the Preface's own rhetoric rather than the essays. The unified version is more restrained and does the job without meta-commentary. I withdraw my alternative.

The metaphysics expert formally maintains the AMEND on line 97 and accepts the unified proposal on lines 95-96. Let me handle this.

**Line 97 vote (final tally):**
- KEEP as-is: Buddhism, Existentialism, Epistemology, Kantian, Phenomenology, Translator-2, Wittgenstein (7)
- SOFTEN: Metaphysics, Phil-mind, Chinese-phil (3)
- My position (editor): KEEP as-is

The majority is clear at 7-3 (or 8-3 including me). The metaphysics expert's position is a registered minority view.
