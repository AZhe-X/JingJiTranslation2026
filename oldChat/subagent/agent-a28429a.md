*Debate *

The author is considering "character" for 德. Those who voted against it — what is your single strongest objection to "character"? Those who voted for it — what is its single strongest advantage?

Also: we now know 性 does NOT appear as a standalone technical term in the collection, so the "nature" collision concern is off the table.

Brief responses — one strongest point each.

  "content": "**Strongest advantage:** \"Character\" is the only option that is simultaneously lightweight enough for dense running text AND neutral enough to let the author's argument define the term rather than the English word pre-defining it. Every other option either over-specifies (\"constitutive nature\" pre-announces the constructivist conclusion) or misleads (\"virtue\" pre-announces a moral reading). \"Character\" arrives empty-handed and lets the author fill it."
