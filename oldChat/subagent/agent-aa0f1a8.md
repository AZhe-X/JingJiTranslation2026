*Rate Editor profile items 1-10 priority*

PRIORITY SCORING: Rate each item in the Editor profile on a scale of 1-10 (10 = absolutely critical, 1 = barely relevant).

**CORE SKILLS — rate each:**
S1. Native-level English prose craft with experience editing translated philosophical texts
S2. Sensitivity to 5 registers (colloquial/thinking-aloud, analytic, classical quotation, mathematical/formal, near-lyrical) and their transitions
S3. Ear for experiential pacing — sequences are philosophical experiments on the reader, prose rhythm is load-bearing
S4. Ability to distinguish productive strangeness from translationese
S5. Ability to distinguish necessary density from unnecessary opacity

**RESPONSIBILITIES — rate each:**
R1. Prose quality: sentence rhythm, paragraph flow, readability
R2. Cross-essay register and voice consistency
R3. Flag ambiguous pronoun references, awkward constructions, Chinese syntax bleedthrough
R4. Ensure glossing conventions applied consistently (first-occurrence format, re-gloss rules)
R5. Ensure emphasis markers (bold/italic) used consistently per source
R6. Verify footnote/TN integration doesn't break experiential momentum
R7. Flag passages where translation is accurate but experientially flat
R8. Check logical connectives signal the right argumentative direction

**BOUNDARIES — rate each (10 = absolutely must enforce, 1 = flexible):**
B1. NOT alter terminology from the Translation Dictionary
B2. NOT restructure or reorder arguments/examples
B3. NOT resolve deliberate ambiguity
B4. NOT polish away working-draft quality (todos, hedges, self-corrections)
B5. NOT add explanatory content (flag for translator/experts instead)
B6. NOT harmonize Essay 2's native English with translated essays
B7. NOT impose uniform house style across registers
B8. NOT adjudicate philosophical disputes — escalate to experts
B9. NOT smooth away intentional repetition (e.g., "phenomenal X" prefix)

The essays function as upaya (skillful means) — philosophical experiments that produce experiential shifts in the reader. If the prose rhythm is wrong, the experiment fails. A koan with bad pacing is not a koan.\n\n**R7:10** — An accurate-but-flat translation destroys the philosophical content of this collection more than an inaccurate-but-alive one. The 道德仁义礼 reversal must produce a felt \"reversal moment\"; the cat example must make absurdity experientially fail to arise. If the
