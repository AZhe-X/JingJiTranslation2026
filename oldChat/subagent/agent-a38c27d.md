*AMEND accepted: eta/intersubjectivity moved to Phil-Mind subsection*

AMEND accepted. You're right — the eta-based intersubjectivity account is primarily a philosophy-of-mind contribution. I'll restructure Section B so that:

- The **Kantian parallels** subsection mentions intersubjectivity only in passing (as transcendental conditions for shared experience) and cross-references the Phil-Mind subsection.
- The **Philosophy of Mind** subsection becomes the home for the full eta/intersubjectivity treatment, including the other-minds argument from Essay 4, the connections to Zahavi/Gallese/Brandom, and the tower-as-meta-cognition model.

The final proposal already has a dedicated Philosophy of Mind bullet in Section B — I'll ensure the intersubjectivity content is consolidated there rather than split across Kantian and Phil-Mind. Thank you.

Acknowledged the editor's acceptance of my amendment. The intersubjectivity/eta content will be consolidated under the Philosophy of Mind subsection in Section B of the Afterword, with a cross-reference from the Kantian subsection. Ready for next task.
