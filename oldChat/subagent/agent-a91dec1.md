*Detailed protocol feedback with essay-specific question proposals*

**Feedback on Reporting-Protocol.md from existentialism-expert**

Overall this is well-structured. The four-stage delivery sequence (Preface -> per-essay -> full collection -> final prompts -> critical experiential checks) correctly protects the reading experience. I have three categories of feedback: one concern, one endorsement, and a detailed response to the essay-specific questions proposal.

---

**1. CONCERN: Line 31 is a leading question.**

"Did you feel like the essay was asking you to *experience* something rather than just understand an argument? Did it work?"

This tells the reader that the essays are designed to produce experiences. After hearing this once (after Essay 1), the reader will approach every subsequent essay watching for "the experiential thing" -- which is exactly the priming we extracted this file to avoid. It converts a naive reader into a semi-informed one.

The problem is subtle: the question is fine as a one-time probe for one essay, but it is listed under "After Each Essay," meaning the reader hears it eight times. By Essay 3, they are not discovering the experiential dimension -- they are performing it.

**Suggested fix:** Remove line 31 from the per-essay template entirely. The information it seeks is already captured by line 29 ("Was there a moment where something 'clicked' or shifted for you? Describe it.") -- a reader who experienced something will report it there. If they don't mention it, that is itself data. We can probe more specifically in the Critical Experiential Checks at the end.

If you want to keep a version of this question, use it exactly once -- after Essay 1 only, as a calibration question to see whether the reader naturally thinks in experiential terms. Then drop it for all subsequent essays.

---

**2. ENDORSEMENT: The Critical Experiential Checks (lines 57-65) are excellent.**

The non-leading formulation is exactly right. "What happened to your experience across the three examples?" does not tell the reader what should have happened. It asks them to report, not to confirm. And the note at line 65 ("Do NOT ask 'Did absurdity dissolve?'") is a crucial guardrail.

One small addition: consider adding a check for Essay 5 (the Poetic). Something like: "In the essay about dreamscapes, what distinction did you come away with?" Essay 5's intoxicated/lucid distinction is the collection's central positive proposal, and it would be valuable to know whether the reader grasped it experientially (as a felt difference between two modes of engagement) or only propositionally (as a labeled dichotomy). But I recognize this may be too leading -- "what distinction" presupposes they noticed one. An alternative: "What stayed with you from the essay about dreamscapes?" -- more open, still diagnostic.

---

**3. ON ESSAY-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS: Yes, but with extreme care about priming.**

The team lead asked whether we should add essay-specific questions alongside the general per-essay template. My answer is a qualified yes -- but the design must respect a hard constraint: **no question should tell the reader what they were supposed to experience.**

Here is my reasoning and proposal:

**The case for essay-specific questions:** The general template (lines 28-33) will produce useful but potentially generic responses. "What do you think this essay was about?" may yield a summary rather than an experiential report. Tailored questions can probe whether specific load-bearing elements survived translation -- but only if they ask about what the reader noticed, not about what we hoped they would notice.

**The priming risk:** Any question that names or describes the experiential payload before the reader reports it is contaminated. "Did the three examples form a progression?" tells the reader there was a progression. "Did you notice the hierarchy reversing?" tells them there was a reversal. These are useless as diagnostic tools because they produce the recognition they claim to measure.

**My proposal: essay-specific questions in Stage 2 (targeted follow-ups), not Stage 1 (general template).**

The per-essay flow would be:

1. Reader finishes essay.
2. General template (lines 28-30, 32-33 -- without line 31, per my concern above).
3. Reader submits general response.
4. **Essay-specific follow-up** -- delivered only after the general response, probing what the reader said (or didn't say) without leading.

Here are my suggested essay-specific follow-ups. I have drafted these from my domain (existentialism/absurdism) for the essays I know best, and offered thoughts on the others:

**Essay 1 (Collective Interest):**
"The essay uses an analogy from physics. Did it help or get in the way?"
-- Tests whether the renormalization metaphor functions as philosophical argument or as opaque jargon. Safe because it references something the reader just encountered, not something they should have felt.

**Essay 2 (Knowledge):**
"This essay was written in English by the author, not translated. Did you notice a difference in how it reads?"
-- Tests whether the register shift between Essay 1 (translated Chinese) and Essay 2 (original English) is perceptible and whether it matters. Non-leading: it asks for observation, not judgment.

**Essay 3 (Sisyphus, Work, and Cats):**
This is the most delicate one. The three-example progression and the cat as philosophical punchline are the core payload. I would NOT ask anything specific in Stage 2. The general template should capture it -- if the cat example lands, the reader will mention it unprompted in response to "Was there a moment where something clicked?" If they don't mention it, that tells us something critical. Save the targeted probe ("What happened to your experience across the three examples?") for the Critical Experiential Checks at the very end, exactly as currently designed.

If you must add something in Stage 2, make it oblique: "Was there an example or image in this essay you'd remember a week from now?" This is open enough that it doesn't point at the cat, but if the reader names the cat, we know it landed.

**Essay 4 (Post-Metaphysics):**
"The essay walks through a sequence from Laozi. How did you follow it -- did you track the logic, or did something else carry you through?"
-- Tests whether the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li passage works as philosophical demonstration or just as exposition. "Something else" leaves room for the reader to report the experiential reversal without being told it exists.

**Essay 5 (The Poetic):**
"After reading this essay, could you describe 'the poetic' to someone in your own words?"
-- Tests whether the concept landed as a graspable idea or remained abstract jargon. The reader's paraphrase will reveal whether they understood it experientially (a mode of engagement) or only nominally (a label).

**Essay 6 (Category Theory and Jing):**
"Were the examples (pens, magic books, ships) doing philosophical work for you, or did they feel like illustrations of something you needed the math to understand?"
-- Directly tests the collection's central accessibility claim. Safe because it asks about the reader's experience of the examples, not about what the examples should have demonstrated.

**Essay 7 (K1 Strategy):**
"Was there a sentence in this essay that you couldn't make sense of at all?"
-- The meme sentence replacement is designed to produce native incomprehensibility. If the reader flags it here, the replacement worked. If they flag a different sentence, we have a translation problem. Open enough not to point at the meme.

**Appendix:**
"Did this feel like an ending? Like a beginning? Like something else?"
-- Tests whether the Appendix functions as the collection's philosophical frame (Mencius + Socrates, the culminating near-lyrical passage) or just as leftovers.

---

**Summary of recommendations:**

1. Remove line 31 from the per-essay template (or use it once, after Essay 1 only).
2. Keep the Critical Experiential Checks exactly as they are -- they are well-designed.
3. Consider adding an Essay 5 experiential check to the Critical Checks section.
4. Add essay-specific follow-ups as a Stage 2 layer, delivered AFTER the general response, designed to probe without leading.
5. For Essay 3 specifically: no essay-specific follow-up in Stage 2. The general template and the end-of-collection Critical Check are sufficient. The cat must arrive unbidden or it hasn't worked.

The existentialism-expert has sent a second set of detailed feedback on the Reporting-Protocol. Let me analyze this against both the current R2 state and the phenomenology-expert's earlier feedback to identify convergences and divergences.

**Key observations on convergence/divergence:**

1. **Line 31 concern:** Both experts flag the same question — but it already doesn't exist in R2. The existentialism-expert is working from an older version of the protocol. This confirms the R2 revision was correct.

2. **Essay-specific questions:** Both experts say yes with constraints, but they propose **different delivery mechanisms**. The phenomenology-expert proposes adding them directly to the per-essay template (alongside general questions). The existentialism-expert proposes a **Stage 2 follow-up** — delivered only after the reader submits their general response. This is a meaningful structural difference. The existentialism-expert's staged approach is more conservative and better protects against priming.

3. **Essay 3:** They **disagree**. The phenomenology-expert thinks Essay 3 is the strongest candidate for an essay-specific question ("Of the three examples, which one affected you most?"). The existentialism-expert says **no essay-specific follow-up for Essay 3** — the cat must arrive unbidden. This is a genuine philosophical disagreement about method.

4. **Essay 5 Critical Check:** The existentialism-expert proposes adding an Essay 5 probe to the Critical Experiential Checks. The current protocol already has one (line 86: "When the author described the two kinds of dreamscapes, what came to mind?"). But the existentialism-expert may have missed it or wants a different formulation.

Let me respond to the existentialism-expert and update the team-lead.
