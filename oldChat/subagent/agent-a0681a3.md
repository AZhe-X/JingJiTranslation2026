*Correction: use 整理 version only, not 其一*

**CORRECTION**: Use the 整理 (cleaned-up) version of 后形而上学, NOT the 其一 (draft) version. The 8 essays are:

1. `22 随笔/关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一.md`
2. `23 Reflection/A Thought on Knowledge.md`
3. `22 随笔/西西弗斯、班与猫.md`
4. `21 无知者的自我记录/后形而上学 整理.md`
5. `21 无知者的自我记录/形而上学后的目的：诗意.md`
6. `21 无知者的自我记录/范畴论与境.md`
7. `21 无知者的自我记录/范畴论与境：K1策略.md`
8. `21 无知者的自我记录/关于诗意和境的一些零散想法.md`

Do NOT load 后形而上学 其一. Only the 整理 version.

Understood. My analysis already used 后形而上学 整理 as the primary source for Essay 4 — that's where the 道德仁义礼 passage and all the 感受 occurrences I cited from Essay 4 come from (lines 16, 24, 26, 136). I did also read 后形而上学 其一 for completeness, but the only additional data points from that file were:

- Line 123: 感受 used for inner/bodily feeling within phenomena
- Line 125: 感受 explicitly paired with 行为 (behavior) as the two things that bridge inner and outer
- Line 159: A section header "### 感受" followed by "……未完成……"

These confirm the same picture — 感受 as the primary phenomenological term — but don't change the analysis. The unfinished section header in 其一 (line 159) suggests the author intended to develop 感受 further but left it incomplete; the 整理 version and Essays 5-7 carry that development instead.

No corrections needed to my recommendation. Standing by.
