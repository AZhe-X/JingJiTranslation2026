*Load 8+1 essays and your report before feedback*

Reminder: Make sure you have loaded the 8+1 source essays and your own Analysis Report into your context before submitting feedback on the Reporting Protocol. You need the essay content fresh in mind to judge what essay-specific questions would be appropriate (and whether they risk priming the reader).

2. Essay 1: `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/22 随笔/关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一.md`

I already have all 8+1 source essays, my Analysis Report, and the Translation Dictionary loaded in context from the beginning of this session, and I already submitted my feedback on the Reporting Protocol to editor before this reminder arrived. No need to reload.
