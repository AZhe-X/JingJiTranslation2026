*What English word to pair with romanized De?*

Follow-up from the author on 德:

The decision to romanize as "De" is settled. But per our established 文言 convention, the first occurrence format is: "English (德 De)" — then plain English thereafter.

The question now is: what English word goes in that slot?

Options on the table:
1. "virtue (德 De)" — then "virtue" in running text
2. "inherent character (德 De)" — then "inherent character" in running text  
3. "defining character (德 De)" — then "defining character" in running text
4. "character (德 De)" — then "character" in running text
5. Something else?

Remember: this English word will be used in running text after the first glossed occurrence. It needs to work for the author's constructivist usage (what makes a thing what it is, constructed bottom-up from phenomena, applies to ALL things not just moral agents).

What is your recommendation for the English part?

Let me think carefully about what English word best captures the author's constructivist sense of 德 -- what makes a thing what it is, constructed bottom-up, applying to all things and not just moral agents.

Recommendation sent. My top pick is **"constitutive nature"** for the English pairing with De. The key reasoning:

- **"Constitutive"** is process-oriented -- it says "this is what makes the thing what it is by composing it" -- which maps perfectly onto the constructivist sense of 德 as built bottom-up from phenomena, not given as innate essence.
- **"Nature"** captures "what-it-is-ness" without moral baggage and applies to all things, not just moral agents.
- I eliminated "inherent character" because "inherent" directly contradicts constructivism (it implies something given/innate), and "character" alone is too ambiguous in a text that also discusses Chinese characters (字).

The format would be: first occurrence "constitutive nature (德, *De*)", then "constitutive nature" in running text, with the option to shorten to just "nature" where context makes the reference clear.
