*What English word to pair with romanized De?*

Follow-up from the author on 德:

The decision to romanize as "De" is settled. But per our established 文言 convention, the first occurrence format is: "English (德 De)" — then plain English thereafter.

The question now is: what English word goes in that slot?

Options on the table:
1. "virtue (德 De)" — then "virtue" in running text
2. "inherent character (德 De)" — then "inherent character" in running text  
3. "defining character (德 De)" — then "defining character" in running text
4. "character (德 De)" — then "character" in running text
5. Something else?

Remember: this English word will be used in running text after the first glossed occurrence. It needs to work for the author's constructivist usage (what makes a thing what it is, constructed bottom-up from phenomena, applies to ALL things not just moral agents).

What is your recommendation for the English part?
