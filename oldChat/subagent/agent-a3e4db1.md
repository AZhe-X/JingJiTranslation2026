*经验: empirical experience or experience?*

Quick confirmation needed on the 经验 (jīngyàn) entry in the Translation Dictionary.

Context: During the 感受 debate, the consensus term mapping was:
- 感受 → "feeling" (default) / "felt experience" (technical)
- 体验 → "experience" 
- 经验 → "empirical experience"
- 感觉 → "sensation"

The question: Should the standalone 经验 dictionary entry have **"empirical experience"** or **"experience"** as its MAIN translation?

Arguments for "empirical experience":
- Distinguishes clearly from 体验 ("experience") in the term mapping
- Captures the accumulated, reflected-upon, Erfahrung quality
- The author uses it in phrases like "经验的总结/预测/抽象" (summary/prediction/abstraction OF empirical experience) and "经验性的" (empirical)
- Prevents reader confusion between 体验 and 经验

Arguments for plain "experience":
- More natural in English
- "Empirical" is implicit in context
- Adding "empirical" every time could feel heavy

Please respond with your position: "empirical experience" or "experience" as main translation for 经验, with brief reasoning.

In these compounds, the context already signals the empirical/accumulated sense without needing the qualifier. And \"经验性的\" naturally translates as \"empirical\" on its own — you wouldn't say \"empirical-experiential.\"\n\nThe disambiguation problem between 经验 and 体验 is real but localized. The two terms almost never appear in the same sentence or paragraph. When they do co-occur (rare), the translator

Voted for "experience" as the main translation of 经验, with "empirical experience" reserved for the rare cases where it co-occurs with 体验 and disambiguation is needed. The term almost always appears in compound phrases where context already signals the empirical/accumulated sense.
