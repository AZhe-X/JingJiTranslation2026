*Acknowledged feedback, noted convergences and divergence*

Thanks for the detailed feedback. I've noted your proposals. A few points on how they relate to the compiled revision:

**Already incorporated in the final protocol:**
- Your Q4 softening proposal converges with epistemology-expert's — the final protocol uses "How would you describe what this essay was asking you to do — follow an argument? Notice something? Something else?" for all essays, resolving the priming concern.
- Essay 5 Critical Experiential Check is included (you're the 4th independent proposal for this).
- Essay 2 bilingual register probe is in the Critical Experiential Checks.
- No essay-specific questions for Essays 3 and 7 — aligned.

**Noted divergence:**
- You propose essay-specific per-essay questions for Essays 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8. The compiled plan places all essay-specific probing in the Critical Experiential Checks at the end (delivered after all reading), with two limited exceptions for apparatus/accessibility (Essay 4 translator's notes, Essays 6-7 notation barrier). Several of your proposed questions are already captured in the expanded Critical Experiential Checks section.

- Your Essay 4 Laozi-surprise question ("Did the author's reading of that passage surprise you?") is a good probe — it's currently in the Critical Checks as "When the author walked through the hierarchy twice, what did you notice?" which targets the same moment from a slightly different angle.

- Your Essay 5 paraphrase question ("How would you describe the author's concept of 'the Poetic' in your own words?") tests communicability rather than experiential resonance — a useful complementary angle. I've noted this for possible addition.

I'm currently standing by per team lead's instructions. Your feedback is compiled and will be factored into any further iterations. Thanks.

Good — no action needed. The editor has confirmed my feedback is incorporated where it converges with the team and noted where it diverges. The final protocol handles everything properly. Standing by.
