*AGREE on both points, withdrawing amendments*

**AGREE** — accepting the unified proposal as-is on both points.

On point 1 (specific examples): Your reasoning is stronger. The essay title "Sisyphus, Class, and Cats" already tells the reader what examples to expect. Listing them again in the Preface is redundant and does pre-load attention. Removing them lets the Preface describe the *method* (mythic-to-mundane progression) without cataloguing the *content*.

On point 2 (Essay 4 reversal): On reflection, keeping the current text is correct. The reversal in Essay 4 is not a surprise twist — the author explicitly announces the direction ("整个逻辑的顺序就被倒反过来") before performing the detailed phenomenological analysis. The experience lies in following the 现象礼/现象仁/现象义 apparatus step by step, not in the surprise that a reversal occurs. Softening to "unexpected relationship" would actually be less honest about what the essay does, and the Preface should not be coy about something the essay itself is upfront about.

I withdraw both proposed amendments. The unified proposal stands as drafted.

Excellent. Chinese-phil expert withdraws both amendments and AGREES as-is. This resolves the remaining open questions:

**Line 97 (Edit 4) final tally:**
- KEEP as-is: 9 (+ me = 10)
- SOFTEN: Metaphysics only (1)

**Edit 3 (specific cases) final tally:**
- REMOVE listing: 9 (+ me = 10)
- KEEP listing: Translator-2 only (1)

Both minorities have shrunk to a single dissenter each. The consensus is overwhelming.

Waiting for the team lead's go-ahead to apply the three Preface edits and produce DRAFT-R3.
