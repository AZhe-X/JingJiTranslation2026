Task 22 is already completed — this appears to be a stale task assignment message from the earlier session. Let me verify.

[tool: TaskGet]
{
  "taskId": "22"
}

Confirmed — Task 22 is already completed. The Editor/Memo.md already contains the "## Expert Report Notes" section with all 9 expert reports summarized. This is a stale message from before the context recovery. No action needed.

I'm still waiting for the team-lead's response to my editorial difficulty assessment and next assignment.
