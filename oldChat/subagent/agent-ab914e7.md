*Reminder: 文言 format applies to Laozi quote too*

Reminder from the author — we already agreed (10/10 unanimous) on the Classical Chinese Quotation Format:

1. Present original 文言 text as a **block quote**
2. Follow with **glossed English translation** — key terms glossed on first occurrence as "English (漢字, pinyin)", e.g., "humaneness (仁, ren)"
3. After first introduction, use **plain English only**
4. 现象X compounds keep "phenomenal" prefix always

This means for the Laozi block quote, the format would be:

> [Original Chinese block quote]
> "When the Way (道, dao) was lost there was virtue (德, de); when virtue was lost there was humaneness (仁, ren); when humaneness was lost there was rightness (义, yi); when rightness was lost there was ritual conduct (礼, li)."

Then in the author's analysis, plain English: "humaneness," "rightness," "ritual conduct" — with 德 shifting to "(constitutive) character" as decided.

Given THIS format — where the glossed English already includes the Chinese characters and pinyin at first occurrence — does the question of "the Way" vs "Dao" still matter? The reader sees "the Way (道, dao)" and has both. 

Reconsider your answer on 道 with this format in mind. Should it be "the Way (道, dao)" or "Dao (道)" in the glossed block quote? One word answer.

But \"the Way\" is the English rendering — it is what appears in running text thereafter when quoting or referencing Laozi. If the author then uses 道 in their own constructivist analysis, that is where the shift to \"Dao\" (romanized) can happen, paralleling the virtue → character shift for 德.",

Answer: **"the Way (道, dao)"** in the glossed block quote. The gloss already provides "dao" for the reader, so the romanization is available either way. "The Way" serves as the English rendering in the Laozi context, and if the author uses 道 in their own constructivist voice, the shift to romanized "Dao" can happen there -- paralleling the virtue → character shift for 德.
