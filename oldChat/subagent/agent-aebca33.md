*Corrected: TNs for realities (Ultimate/Primary/Secondary as glosses only)*

CORRECTION — the previous question had a typo. Here is the actual proposal from the author:

The main translations STAY as they are:
- 第〇实在 → **Zeroth Reality**
- 第一实在 → **First Reality**
- 第二实在 → **Second Reality**

But each would get a **translator's note (TN)** with an interpretive gloss:
- Zeroth Reality (TN: "Ultimate Reality")
- First Reality (TN: "Primary Reality")
- Second Reality (TN: "Secondary Reality")

So the ordinal names are preserved in the main text. The TNs just provide the reader with an additional interpretive handle.

Is this a good idea? Do these TN glosses help the reader, or do they introduce the same problems (ontological weight for "Ultimate," evaluative connotation for "Secondary") even when relegated to a footnote? Keep your response concise.

Response sent. Split verdict: "Primary" and "Secondary" are fine as TN glosses (they reinforce the epistemic-access ordering). But "Ultimate" for Zeroth Reality remains problematic even in a footnote -- it invites exactly the misidentification with *paramartha*/Brahman/God that the author argues against. Proposed alternative: a functional TN that explains Zeroth Reality *occupies the role* of traditional ultimate reality while noting why it cannot *be* that. Standing by.
