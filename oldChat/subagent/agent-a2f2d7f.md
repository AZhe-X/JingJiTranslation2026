*Should we TN 境界 as *

Quick question from the author on 境界:

We agreed 境界 → "bounds" / "horizon" with a footnote at line 25 (where 境界 and bare 境 appear side by side, the "conceptual birth" moment).

**New proposal:** Should we ALSO add a brief translator's note at the FIRST appearance of 境界 (line 17: "在语言的*境界*（界限）内") noting that 境界 literally = "boundary (界) of Jing (境)"?

This would give the reader two notes with different jobs:
1. **Line 17 (first occurrence):** brief TN — "境界 = boundary of Jing" (etymological primer)
2. **Line 25 (境界 and 境 side by side):** deeper footnote — the moment 境 separates from 境界

Or is one note at line 25 sufficient? Does front-loading the 境-connection at line 17 help or overburden the reader? Keep your response concise — yes/no with brief reasoning.

When the deeper note at line 25 reveals the connection, the reader has to retroactively reparse two passages. That is unnecessary cognitive friction.\n\nThe two-note structure mirrors how the author teaches concepts throughout the
