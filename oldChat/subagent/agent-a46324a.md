Let me start by reading the source text carefully.

Good, I have the full source. Let me also check the Translation Dictionary for any relevant entries, and re-read the memo notes for Essay 3.

The source is relatively short — about 1,500 Chinese characters. Let me study it carefully before drafting.

Key structural elements I need to preserve:
1. The opening — conversational, personal anecdote about discussing absurdism with a friend
2. The definition of absurdity as off-tone (非和谐) when seeking meaning externally
3. The author's direct rebuttal — "you asked the wrong question!"
4. The watch metaphor
5. **The three-example gradient:** Sisyphus -> office worker -> cat owner
6. The interrupted thought with em dash at line 16
7. The entrepreneurship pivot
8. The cat passage — plain, warm, no ornamentation
9. The closing reflection on cats

Let me also read the Glossary Introduction to ensure terminological consistency.

Good — confirmed: 非和谐 = "the off-tone" (author's own English). Now let me draft the translation.
