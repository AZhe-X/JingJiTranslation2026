*Confirming 诗意 resolution: *

The author endorses the current resolution for 诗意 (shiyi):

- **"the poetic"** as the standard substantive form
- **"poetic"** as adjective
- **"poeticality"** acceptable as an occasional variant noun
- **Capitalize "the Poetic"** in the translator's introduction and glossary to signal philosophical weight

Does everyone still agree with this resolution? Any second thoughts now that we've been through the full dictionary discussion? Concise yes/no + any brief additions.

  "summary": "Agree, one note on capitalization scope",
  "content": "**Yes, still agree.** One small note: capitalize \"the Poetic\" not only in the glossary and translator's introduction but also on first occurrence in each essay where it appears as a technical term. After that, lowercase \"the poetic\" in running text. This mirrors the standard convention for Heideggerian terms (e.g., \"Being\" capitalized when referring to Sein as a philosophical concept, \"being\" lowercase for Seiendes in running text). It signals to the reader: \"this word is doing philosophical work here\" without cluttering every subsequent occurrence.\n"

Standing by. All my tasks are complete. Ready for further consultation questions as the translation proceeds.
