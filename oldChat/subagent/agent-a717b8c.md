*梦境 contains 境 — should translation preserve this link?*

Question from the author: 梦境 contains the character 境 — the same 境 as in the title 境集 and the central concept 境 (Jing). But "dreamscape" (and most proposed translations) doesn't capture this connection. The reader of the English text would not see that 梦境 literally contains 境.

Does this matter? Should the translation of 梦境 somehow preserve the 境 connection? If so, how?

Brief responses welcome. This is a real translation problem.

Sent my response. The key point: the 境 inside 梦境 is philosophically load-bearing, not just etymological. Proposed two consistent solutions -- "dream-jing" (if transliterating) or "dream-sphere" (if translating) -- and warned against the inconsistency of rendering 境 as "Jing" in technical contexts but 梦境 as "dreamscape" elsewhere.
