*Review Reporting-Protocol, send feedback to editor*

Task: Review the Reporting-Protocol.md (in Standby Reader directory) and send your advice, suggestions, or confirmation to **editor**. 

The file is at: `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Standby Reader/Reporting-Protocol.md`

Read the file, then send your feedback directly to **editor** (not to me). Editor will orchestrate everyone's suggestions and discuss back and forth until a plan is agreed. Use your own judgment throughout.

One suggestion from the project lead to consider: **Should we add essay-specific questions alongside the general per-essay questions?** For example, after Essay 1 we might ask something tailored to what Essay 1 does, after Essay 2 something tailored to Essay 2, etc. — not just the same generic template for every essay. Think about whether this would be valuable, what those questions might look like, and whether they risk priming the reader (the same concern that led us to extract this file in the first place).

Send your feedback to **editor** when ready.

The staged delivery (Preface -> per-essay -> collection-level -> final prompts -> critical experiential checks) correctly orders the questioning from open to targeted, preventing earlier questions from contaminating later responses. The \"delivery rule\" at the top and the \"non-leading\" instruction at the bottom are exactly right.\n\n### On Essay-Specific Questions\n\nTeam-lead asked us to consider whether to add essay-specific questions alongside the generic per-essay template. My recommendation: **Yes, but with strict constraints.**\n\n**The risk:** Essay-specific questions can prime the reader. If after Ess
