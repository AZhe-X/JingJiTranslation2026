*Record Q1 response, continue to Q2-Q7*

Existentialism-expert already responded to Q1. Please record their response in your Q1 file, then continue with the remaining questions (Q2-Q7). Send them to the relevant experts one at a time. If Q1 needs input from additional experts (e.g., phenomenology-expert), send it to them too before moving on.

I already recorded the existentialism expert's response in the Q1 file and sent Q1 to the phenomenology expert for a second opinion. That message is already in flight. Let me now proceed with Q2 while waiting for the phenomenology expert's reply on Q1.

Q2 sent to the Chinese philosophy expert. Now let me also check — I don't need to wait for Q2's response before sending Q3, since these are independent questions going to different experts. But the instructions say "send questions one at a time, wait for response." Let me respect that and wait for the Chinese philosophy expert's response on Q2.

While waiting, let me confirm my queue of remaining questions:
- Q1: Sent to existentialism-expert (done, recorded), sent to phenomenology-expert (awaiting response)
- Q2: Sent to chinese-phil-expert (awaiting response)
- Q3: Will go to epistemology-expert
- Q4: Will go to buddhism-expert and phenomenology-expert
- Q5: Will go to wittgenstein-expert
- Q6: Will go to buddhism-expert
- Q7: Will go to chinese-phil-expert

I'm idle and ready to be woken up when responses arrive.
