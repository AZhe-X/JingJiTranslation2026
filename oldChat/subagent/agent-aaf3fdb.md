*Prior paragraph already explains 形而上 — still need inline?*

New context: the author points out that BEFORE the 道德仁义礼 passage, there is already a paragraph that explicitly explains the 形/形而上/上 structure:

"前形而上学有一个形式上的错误理解，既是对'上'的理解。形而上学的英文，'metaphysics'，字面上来看，既是元物理。倘若把物理理解为现象，那么形而上学所描述的，既是产生现象的原因。然而事实上...形而上学事实上是自现象而产生的。所谓'上'，应当是我们基于现象之上而有的一套理解，而非自上而下由形而上生成了形。"

This paragraph already:
- Explains that "metaphysics" literally means 元物理 (meta-physics)
- Reinterprets 上 (above) as "built upon phenomena" not "generating phenomena from above"
- Explicitly says the direction is wrong: 形而上 should mean "constructed upon 形," not "generating 形 from above"

Given that the reader will have ALREADY read this explanation before encountering the 道德仁义礼 sentence ("the Way is 形而上, ritual conduct is 形"), is the inline "above-the-phenomenal" still needed? Or is a TN sufficient — since the author's own text already does the explanatory work?

Reconsider. Brief response.

Retracted both my earlier suggestions. The author's own preceding paragraph already explains the 形/形而上/上 structure in full. Adding a TN or inline parenthetical at the later sentence would redundantly repeat what the author already said — and worse, would imply the translator does not trust the author's own exposition. The only requirement is that the earlier explanatory paragraph is translated clearly. Trust the text.
