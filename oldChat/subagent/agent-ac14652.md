*Debate: intoxicated vs absorbed vs immersed for 沉醉*

The author wants a focused debate on the translation of 沉醉 / 沉醉的梦境:

Current split:
- **"intoxicated"** (metaphysics, existentialism, chinese-phil, buddhism) — preserves the Chinese metaphor (沉=sink, 醉=drunk), Buddhist resonance (mada, clouded awareness)
- **"absorbed"** (phenomenology) — more neutral, closer to Heidegger's Verfallen
- **"immersed"** (wittgenstein, phil-mind) — neutral, captures the "sunk-in" quality without pejorative connotation

The key tension: "intoxicated" is faithful to the source metaphor but carries negative connotations in English (implies impairment, poor judgment). "Absorbed" and "immersed" are neutral but lose the 醉 (drunk) component.

Please debate this among yourselves. Make your case, respond to the other positions, and see if you can reach consensus. Is the pejorative connotation of "intoxicated" a feature (the author IS describing a state of unknowing) or a bug (the author is not morally condemning pre-metaphysical existence)?

Made my case for "intoxicated" on three grounds: (1) Kant's own language for the pre-critical state is not neutral either, (2) "absorbed" and "immersed" are compatible with full awareness while 沉醉 specifically denotes its absence, and (3) the structural pair intoxicated/lucid preserves the epistemic contrast that absorbed/lucid and immersed/lucid do not. Standing by for the debate.
