*APPROVE all 8 revisions, minor note on Essay 5 probe wording*

**APPROVE** the plan as a whole. All 8 revisions are well-synthesized. A few brief notes:

**Revision 2 (Defer Q4 to Part 2):** I accept the majority position. My concern about experiential effects going unreported is real but the counter-argument is correct — if Q2 ("clicked or shifted") doesn't surface them unprompted, that is itself diagnostic data. The Fish/Fishing naivete is more important to protect.

**Revision 5 (Marginal notes):** The revised "if you made any marks" framing is the right call. Making it optional avoids creating a failed-task feeling while still capturing pre-reflective data when available.

**Revision 7 (Expanded Critical Checks):** Good to see Essays 1, 2, 5, 6, and Appendix added. The probes are all properly non-leading. I note that the Essay 5 probe ("What did you make of the dreamscape concept?") is slightly more conceptual than experiential — consider "What was your experience of the dreamscape idea?" to match the experiential framing of the other probes. Very minor.

**Revision 8 (Essay 5→6 transition flag):** Important observation. This is exactly the kind of structural friction a standby reader will surface that we experts cannot detect from inside the philosophical content.

No amendments needed. The plan is ready.

The Essay 5 probe wording suggestion (\"What was your experience of the dreamscape idea?\" vs. \"What did you make of the dreamscape concept?\") is a good catch on maintaining experiential framing consistency.
