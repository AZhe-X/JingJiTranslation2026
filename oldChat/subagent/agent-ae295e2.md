*梦境 contains 境 — should translation preserve this link?*

Question from the author: 梦境 contains the character 境 — the same 境 as in the title 境集 and the central concept 境 (Jing). But "dreamscape" (and most proposed translations) doesn't capture this connection. The reader of the English text would not see that 梦境 literally contains 境.

Does this matter? Should the translation of 梦境 somehow preserve the 境 connection? If so, how?

Brief responses welcome. This is a real translation problem.

Sent my response. The key point: 梦境 is taxonomically a species of 境 (a specific kind of experiential-field), not just a metaphor. The English must preserve this visible connection, either through a shared root word (like "-scape" in "dreamscape" if 境 = "scape") or by leaving 境 untranslated. Using unrelated English words for the two would be a structural translation error that severs the conceptual architecture.
