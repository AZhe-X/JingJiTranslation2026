*梦境 contains 境 — should translation preserve this link?*

Question from the author: 梦境 contains the character 境 — the same 境 as in the title 境集 and the central concept 境 (Jing). But "dreamscape" (and most proposed translations) doesn't capture this connection. The reader of the English text would not see that 梦境 literally contains 境.

Does this matter? Should the translation of 梦境 somehow preserve the 境 connection? If so, how?

Brief responses welcome. This is a real translation problem.

Response sent. The key argument: the link between 梦境 and 境 is not merely etymological but **developmental** --- 梦境 is where the concept of 境 first appears, and the later formal 境 grows out of it. If we transliterate 境 as *jing*, consistency demands "dream-*jing*" for 梦境, at least at the definitional first occurrence. Breaking the link by using "dreamscape" in one essay and "*jing*" in another would hide the conceptual genealogy from the English reader.
