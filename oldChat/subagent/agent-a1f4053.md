*Final review: Preface + Afterword blueprint — confirm or advise*

**Final review round.** Please read both documents and respond with **CONFIRM** or **ADVICE** (with specific suggestion):

1. **Translator's Preface (DRAFT-R3):**
`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Draft/Translators-Preface.md`

2. **Afterword Blueprint (updated):**
`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Editor/Afterword-Blueprint.md`

Check both for completeness, accuracy, and anything missing from your domain. This is the final check before we move on.

Both documents are thorough. Let me verify my domain coverage in the Afterword Blueprint and confirm.

  "type": "message",
  "recipient": "team-lead",
  "content": "**CONFIRM** on both documents.\n\n**Translator's Preface (DRAFT-R3):** Clean, spoiler-free, well-paced. The narrative arc flows naturally. All existentialism-relevant content is handled correctly — absurdity is named as a topic without revealing its dissolution, the Poetic and non-rational are flagged as key concepts without explanation, and the experiential sequences section describes method without results. No issues.\n\n**Afterword Blueprint:** Comprehensive and accurate from my domain. All five of my key contributions are present and correctly placed in the existentialist positioning section:\n1. The Poetic vs. Nietzsche/Camus/Heidegger comparison\n2. The livability point (cat-raiser, coin-flipper as everyday figures)\n3.

CONFIRM on both documents. The Preface is clean and spoiler-free; the Afterword Blueprint is comprehensive and accurate from the existentialism domain, with all five key contributions correctly placed. Ready to move on to the next phase of work.
