*AMEND accepted: 3 existentialist points added to Afterword*

AMEND accepted. All three points are genuine contributions that distinguish the work from the existentialist canon:

1. **Intoxicated/lucid dreamscape as resolution of authenticity/bad faith** — the ritual analogy (burning incense knowing it doesn't reach the dead) is a concrete example that deserves explicit treatment. Added to the existentialist bullet. (Note: the "livability" point already in the outline complements this — together they show the author's post-nihilistic stance is both philosophically rigorous and practically inhabitable.)

2. **Critique of Being-toward-death** — the transcendence argument from the Appendix is a genuine philosophical contribution. Added.

3. **Eta as intersubjectivity resolution (existentialist framing)** — I'll cross-reference this in the existentialist bullet while keeping the full structural treatment under Philosophy of Mind (per the phil-mind expert's accepted amendment). The existentialist framing (Sartre's adversarial Look vs. structural commensurability) and the phil-mind framing (shared eta without shared qualia) are complementary perspectives on the same contribution.

Thank you.

Noted. All three amendments accepted and cross-referenced appropriately. The editor's handling is sound — keeping the full structural treatment of eta under Philosophy of Mind while cross-referencing the existentialist framing (Sartre's Look vs. structural commensurability) avoids redundancy while ensuring both perspectives are represented.

Waiting for further instructions.
