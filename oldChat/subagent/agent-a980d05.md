*Should we TN 境界 as *

Quick question from the author on 境界:

We agreed 境界 → "bounds" / "horizon" with a footnote at line 25 (where 境界 and bare 境 appear side by side, the "conceptual birth" moment).

**New proposal:** Should we ALSO add a brief translator's note at the FIRST appearance of 境界 (line 17: "在语言的*境界*（界限）内") noting that 境界 literally = "boundary (界) of Jing (境)"?

This would give the reader two notes with different jobs:
1. **Line 17 (first occurrence):** brief TN — "境界 = boundary of Jing" (etymological primer)
2. **Line 25 (境界 and 境 side by side):** deeper footnote — the moment 境 separates from 境界

Or is one note at line 25 sufficient? Does front-loading the 境-connection at line 17 help or overburden the reader? Keep your response concise — yes/no with brief reasoning.

Telling them that 境界 = \"boundary of *Jing*\" at this point gives them information they cannot use --- *Jing* means nothing to them yet. The note would be noise, or worse, it would prime the reader to think 境界 IS the key concept, when in fact 境界 is the shell that 境 will break out of.\n\nThe power of line 25 is precisely that it is the moment where the reader already has 境界 = \"bounds\" established from lines 17 and 19, and then sees bare 境 appear for the first time. The footnote at line 25 can do both jobs at once: note the etymology AND mark the conceptual birth. Front-loading at line 1
