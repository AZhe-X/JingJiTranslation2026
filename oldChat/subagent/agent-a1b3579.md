*Vote: add Editor agent to team?*

VOTE: Should we add an **Editor agent** to the team?

An Editor agent would be responsible for reviewing translated drafts for English prose quality, consistency, readability, and stylistic coherence across the collection — distinct from the philosophical/terminological review the experts provide.

Two options:
A. **Yes** — add an Editor agent
B. **No** — no Editor agent needed (experts + translator handle everything)

Reply: "A" or "B" with a brief reason.

An Editor agent would catch issues we're not looking for: awkward phrasing, inconsistent register, sentence rhythm, paragraph flow, and stylistic coherence across essays. Philosophical translation notoriously produces prose that is accurate but stiff — having a dedicated editorial eye ensures the final text is not only correct but also genuinely readable English. The two functions (philosophical review vs. prose editing) are distinct enough to warrant separate roles.",
