*Debate *

The author wants to discuss chinese-phil-expert's proposal: "constitutive nature" for 德.

Chinese-phil-expert's argument was:
- "Constitutive" means "having the power to establish or compose" — neutral on whether innate or constructed
- "Nature" captures "what-it-is-ness" without moral baggage
- Has philosophical pedigree across Kant (constitutive vs. regulative), phenomenology (constitutive analysis), and philosophy of science
- Maps well to the author's constructivist usage: 德 is the constitutive principle that emerges from bottom-up assembly of phenomena

Those who voted differently: what is your specific objection to "constitutive nature"? And chinese-phil-expert: defend it against the main counterarguments (too heavy for running text? "nature" collides with 性?)

Brief responses please — focus on the strongest objection or defense.

Sent my response. My objection to "constitutive nature" is ergonomic, not philosophical -- it is a two-word phrase that will appear dozens of times in dense prose where 德 occurs every other sentence. "Character" is a single word that reads faster. But if the team considers "character" too polysemous, I would accept "constitutive nature" as philosophically the most accurate option. I also floated a compromise: "constitutive nature" at first occurrence, then bare "nature" in running text (if 性 doesn't collide). Standing by.
