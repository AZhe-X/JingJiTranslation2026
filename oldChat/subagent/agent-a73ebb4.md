*Debate: intoxicated vs absorbed vs immersed for 沉醉*

The author wants a focused debate on the translation of 沉醉 / 沉醉的梦境:

Current split:
- **"intoxicated"** (metaphysics, existentialism, chinese-phil, buddhism) — preserves the Chinese metaphor (沉=sink, 醉=drunk), Buddhist resonance (mada, clouded awareness)
- **"absorbed"** (phenomenology) — more neutral, closer to Heidegger's Verfallen
- **"immersed"** (wittgenstein, phil-mind) — neutral, captures the "sunk-in" quality without pejorative connotation

The key tension: "intoxicated" is faithful to the source metaphor but carries negative connotations in English (implies impairment, poor judgment). "Absorbed" and "immersed" are neutral but lose the 醉 (drunk) component.

Please debate this among yourselves. Make your case, respond to the other positions, and see if you can reach consensus. Is the pejorative connotation of "intoxicated" a feature (the author IS describing a state of unknowing) or a bug (the author is not morally condemning pre-metaphysical existence)?

I switched my position from "immersed" to "intoxicated" after deeper analysis. The key argument: in the tower structure, 沉醉 corresponds to being at T_0 without T_1 access -- first-order experience without meta-cognitive awareness of its constructed nature. "Intoxicated" is the only option that structurally precludes meta-cognitive clarity, making the contrast with 清醒 (lucid) maximally sharp. "Immersed" and "absorbed" are compatible with maintained meta-awareness, which breaks the distinction the author needs. Standing by.
