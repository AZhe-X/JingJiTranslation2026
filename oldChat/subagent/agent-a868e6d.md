*Vote on Afterword — yes/no/optional, with reasons*

ALL TEAM MEMBERS:

New question from the author: **Since we decided the work doesn't need an external introduction BEFORE the essays, should there be an Afterword AFTER the essays?**

For example, an editor's afterword, a translator's afterword, or a critical afterword that discusses the work's significance, connections to other traditions, etc. — placed AFTER the reader has completed the experiential sequences.

This would avoid the spoiler problem entirely (the reader has already experienced everything) while still providing the scholarly positioning, cross-traditional connections, and critical context that a Foreword would have provided.

Vote:
- **YES** — include an Afterword (say what kind)
- **NO** — not needed
- **OPTIONAL** — nice to have but not necessary

Brief reason (1-2 sentences).

Adding a separate critical afterword risks creating a redundant layer. That said, if the translators or an invited scholar wanted to write one, the post-essay position is the right place for it — it could draw the cross-traditional connections (to Kant, Heidegger, Wittgenstein, etc.) that the Preface rightly avoids, since the reader would now have the experiential basis to evaluate them. But the collectio

Waiting for the team lead's response on the afterword vote.
