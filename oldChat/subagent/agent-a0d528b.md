*All 5 recommendations addressed, no new changes needed*

Thank you for the detailed review. All 5 recommendations have been addressed:

1. **套用 → "imposed...onto"** — Already changed. You and the phil-mind expert flagged this independently. The draft now reads "I have merely **imposed** my explanation...onto the phenomenal ritual conduct we observe **others** performing."

2. **Parentheses → italics for (can)/(should)** — Not adopted. I checked the original Chinese: the author uses parentheses + bold — （**可以**）and （**应该**）. Our "(**can**)" and "(**should**)" mirrors the source format exactly. Removing parentheses would depart from the author's own typographic choice.

3. **"Paper" for 画纸** — Already changed from "canvas." Footnote 24 now reads "the paper on which a painting is made."

4. **失 echo TN** — Deferred. The echo is preserved in the text ("lost" in the quote, "**lost**" at line 46), and the existentialism expert also validated this. Adding a TN would over-annotate.

5. **TN3 universality of 德** — Already added. TN3 now includes: "Crucially, the author extends 德 beyond persons to all things (凡事诸物皆有其德): every entity has its 'character,' the regularity that makes it what it is."

Your analysis of the 解释 pivot and the language-game structure of the argument was particularly valuable — it confirms that the key logical moves survive the translation. No new changes needed from your review.

Good to hear. Three of five adopted, one reasonably declined (parentheses matching the author's typographic choice -- that is a fair argument I accept), one deferred. The draft is in strong shape. Standing by for further tasks.
