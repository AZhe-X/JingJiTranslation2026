*Is *

The author asks: would translating 德 as "virtue" risk large misleading interpretations for readers of 境集?

Context: Chinese-phil-expert recommends "virtue" as the default (it's the mainstream sinological standard), with "potency" in specifically Daoist passages, and a glossary/TN explaining the wider senses (moral virtue → natural potency → inherent character).

But the author's usage is constructivist — 德 in 境集 is not purely Confucian moral virtue nor purely Daoist natural potency. The worry: does "virtue" carry so much moral baggage in English that it would actively mislead readers about what the author means?

Please assess:
1. How misleading is "virtue" for 德 in this author's specific philosophical context?
2. Would an alternative (e.g., "de" romanized, "character," "potency") be less misleading, or would it create other problems?
3. Is the TN/glossary sufficient to correct any misleading impression, or is the word itself too loaded?

Give your honest assessment — the author wants to know if "virtue" is safe or dangerous here.

The author writes: \"我们便把我们认为（应当是）人人皆而有之的东西...称之为'德'...使得*人*而成为*人*的东西.\"\n\nIn English, \"virtue\" overwhelmingly triggers *moral* associations (the virtues, virtuous behavior, virtue ethics). An English reader encountering \"virtue is what makes a person a person\" will think the author is ma
