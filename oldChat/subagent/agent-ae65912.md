Quick check: for 道 in the Laozi block quote, do we use "the Way" (Ivanhoe/Lau/Chan standard) or "Dao" (romanized)?

Note: in the author's own analysis, we may use "Dao" as a romanized term. The question is specifically about the block quote.

YES = "the Way" in the block quote
NO = something else (say what)

One word answer.

  "content": "NO. Use \"Dao\" in the block quote too — same consistency argument as 仁/义/礼. If we use \"the Way\" in the quote and \"Dao\" in the analysis, that is one more split the reader must track. And \"Dao\" is well-established enough in English that no reader of philosophical prose will stumble on it."

Voted NO on "the Way" — recommended "Dao" in the block quote for consistency, same argument as the other terms. Standing by.
