**Context check.** Please confirm you still have the following loaded in your context:

Let me check what I actually have in context. I need to be honest about this.

From the conversation history and system reminders, I have:
- The Translator's Preface (DRAFT-R3) — read multiple times
- The Profile.md with my workflow and memo from Step 1
- The Glossary-Introduction.md — read once
- Essay4-DaoDeRenYiLi.md draft — read once
- Essay 8 (Appendix) source text — read once
- The Translation Dictionary — referenced but I should check if I actually read it

I do NOT have all 8+1 source essays loaded. My Profile.md says "Do NOT re-read the source essays (your memo covers them)" — the memo from Step 1 covers them. But I don't have the full memo loaded either, only the summary in Profile.md.

I also don't have the 9 expert Analysis Reports in context — those were part of Step 2 which I'm not sure was completed in my thread.

Reported my context status honestly. I have the Preface, Glossary Introduction, Profile with memo summaries, and the full spoiler/Afterword discussion — but not the source essays or expert reports in full. Standing by for instructions on what to reload.
