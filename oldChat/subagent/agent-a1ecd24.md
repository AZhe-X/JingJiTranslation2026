*Review draft translation, send feedback to translator-2*

Please review the draft translation of the 道德仁义礼 passage from Essay 4 (后形而上学 整理).

**Original Chinese**: Read the original essay at: /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录/后形而上学 整理.md (lines 18-30 for the passage, and footnotes [^3], [^4], [^24] at lines 136-138, 172)

**Draft translation**: Read /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Draft/Essay4-DaoDeRenYiLi.md

Compare the draft against the original Chinese carefully. Then send your comments, suggestions, agreements, and any concerns **directly to translator-2** via message. Focus on your area of expertise (Buddhism/Madhyamaka) — the constructivist inversion (conventional vs ultimate), emptiness parallels, the dependent origination structure implicit in the passage.

Now I have a thorough comparison. Let me send my review to translator-2, focusing on my area of expertise (Buddhism/Madhyamaka).

The TNs are well-placed and informative. The 文言 block quote format is correctly applied. I have no major objections — my comments are refinements, not corrections.\n\n---\n\n### What works well\n\n1. **The reversal structure is clear.** The reader can follow the bottom-up construction (phenomenal ritual conduct → phenomenal humaneness → character → the Way) and then see the inversion (the Way → character → humaneness → ritual conduct). This is the passage's philosophical payloa

Review sent to translator-2. Key points:

- **Overall: strong draft**, no major objections
- **Praised**: reversal structure clarity, 德 split execution, "buried from view" rendering, phenomenal-X consistency
- **One substantive suggestion**: Footnote 24 — "enables existence to stand" instead of "makes existence possible" to avoid importing Kantian "conditions of possibility" overtones into a Daoist concept
- **Minor refinements**: consider italicizing early uses of "generated" to mark the conventional/illusory reading; "pursuing the branches and forgetting the root" could use a brief gloss noting it's a classical idiom
- **Noted without adding**: the property-to-definition reversal is structurally parallel to Nagarjuna's critique of svabhava, but correctly NOT cross-referenced in the translation since the author doesn't invoke Buddhist terminology

Standing by for further questions.
