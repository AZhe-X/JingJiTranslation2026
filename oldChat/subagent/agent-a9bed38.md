*Romanized terms kill the philosophical experiment*

The author raises a critical point about the "philosophical experiment" argument:

If we romanize everything — Dao, De, Ren, Yi, Li — then the passage has NO English semantic content for the Western reader. The reader encounters five opaque foreign terms in a sequence. The "philosophical experiment" (where the reader first accepts a conventional understanding, then watches it get deconstructed) CANNOT work, because the reader never had a conventional understanding to begin with. The romanized terms have very few morphisms in their Jing — they are semantically empty for the English reader.

The experiment requires the reader to FEEL something when they read "virtue," "humaneness," "righteousness" — to bring their own associations — and THEN experience the reversal. If they just see "De, Ren, Yi, Li," they have nothing to reverse. The passage becomes an abstract report about foreign concepts rather than a lived philosophical experience.

Does this change your thinking? Should we use English translations (the Way, virtue, humaneness, rightness, ritual conduct) in the block quote precisely SO the philosophical experiment works on the English reader?

Reconsider. Brief response.

But the author's argument applies further: even in the author's own analysis, the reader needs to *feel* the terms to experience the reversal. If the author's analysis says \"we observe phenomenal Li, infer phenomenal Ren, generalize to De, abstract to Dao\" -- this is an opaque report. If it says \"we observe phenomenal ritual conduct, infer phenomenal humaneness, generalize to virtue, abstract to the Way\" -- the reader can follow the reversal because each term activates English associa

Standing by. Ready for the next question from the team lead or translators.
