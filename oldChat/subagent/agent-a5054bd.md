*Confirmed: *

Thank you. Amendment withdrawal noted — 11/11 full consensus.

The "lived experience" fix is already in the final text I sent you. The Edit 3 instructions I provided read: "the reader is invited to test the essay's claim against their own experience" — no "lived." You're good to apply as written.

Please confirm when all three edits and the YAML header update are applied.
