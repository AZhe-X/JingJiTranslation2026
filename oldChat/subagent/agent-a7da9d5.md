*Load 8+1 essays and your report before feedback*

Reminder: Make sure you have loaded the 8+1 source essays and your own Analysis Report into your context before submitting feedback on the Reporting Protocol. You need the essay content fresh in mind to judge what essay-specific questions would be appropriate (and whether they risk priming the reader).

Source essays:

2. Essay 1: `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/22 随笔/关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一.md`
3. Essay 2: `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/23 Reflection/A Thought on Knowledge.md`

Good. Now I have the full content of all essays and my analysis report fresh in context. Having read everything carefully, I can now send a more grounded, essay-informed revision of my feedback to editor. My initial feedback was already sent, but the team-lead wanted me to ground it in the actual essay content. Let me send a supplementary message to editor with refined essay-specific question proposals, now informed by the actual essay content.

Supplementary feedback sent to editor with essay-specific questions now grounded in the actual essay content. Key additions beyond my initial feedback:

- Flagged that Essay 3's Critical Experiential Check says "three examples" but the essay actually has four stages (Sisyphus -> office worker -> entrepreneur -> cat owner); recommended changing to "the examples"
- Proposed a Part Transition question after Essay 3 to capture reader expectations at the Fish/Fishing pivot point
- Explained why Essays 3, 4, and 7 need no additional questions (already covered by Critical Checks) while Essays 1, 2, 5, 6, and Appendix benefit from targeted follow-ups
