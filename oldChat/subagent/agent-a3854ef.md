*Review proposed translator profile*

DISCUSSION: Proposed profile for the dedicated philosophical translator agent. Please review and respond with whether you AGREE, or if you want to ADD, CHANGE, or REMOVE anything.

Proposed profile:
1. Native-level command of both Chinese and English
2. Philosophical training (not purely literary)
3. Literary sensibility (not purely academic)
4. Category theory / mathematical notation literacy
5. Experience with register shifts (colloquial ↔ technical ↔ poetic)
6. Translator models: Burton Watson, A.C. Graham, Brook Ziporyn

Please respond with:
- AGREE (if you're satisfied with the profile as-is)
- Or specific additions/changes/removals with justification

This is discussion time -- if you disagree with another expert's suggestion, say so. We want consensus before proceeding.

The translator needs to understand that certain passages are not just *saying* something but *doing* something to the reader, and that the orderin

I've sent my response: agreement with the core profile plus two additions -- (1) explicit awareness of "philosophical experiments" as an experiential design requirement, and (2) contemporary philosophical translator models to complement the classical Chinese translation models already listed. I also underscored that category theory literacy is non-optional given how mathematical terms carry philosophical meaning in these essays.
