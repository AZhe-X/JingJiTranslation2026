*Vote on Foreword — yes/no/optional, with reasons*

ALL TEAM MEMBERS (experts, translator-2, editor):

Vote: **Should this collection include a Foreword?**

Reminder: A Foreword is written by someone other than the author or translator — typically a scholar, philosopher, or expert who can position the work for the reader. The Translator's Preface (DRAFT-R2) is already done and confirmed.

The question is: in addition to the Translator's Preface, should there be a Foreword?

Options:
- **YES** — include a Foreword
- **NO** — Translator's Preface is sufficient
- **OPTIONAL** — nice to have but not necessary

Please vote AND give a brief reason (1-2 sentences). Everyone votes.

Let me think about this carefully from the translator's perspective, considering what the Translator's Preface already covers and what a Foreword would add.

The Translator's Preface (DRAFT-R2) already:
- Explains the title and central concept (Jing)
- Introduces the author's background
- Describes the Fish/Fishing structure
- Explains the bilingual nature
- Covers the 形 reinterpretation
- Points readers to the Glossary Introduction for terminology
- Explains experiential sequences as philosophical experiments
- Gives reading recommendations

A Foreword would typically position the work within a broader intellectual landscape — something like "why this matters" from an authoritative external voice.

A Foreword from an established philosopher could lend institutional credibility and place the collection within ongoing academic conversations (post-metaphysics, formal phenomenology, cross-tradition philosophy), which the Translator's Preface deliberately avoids doing — the Preface serves the reader, not the discipline. But the collection is strong enough to stand on the Preface alone, and the wrong Foreword (o

Vote sent: **OPTIONAL**. The Translator's Preface already handles reader orientation well. A Foreword could add institutional credibility and disciplinary positioning, but the wrong one — one that over-assimilates to Western frameworks or exoticizes the work — would do more harm than good. The collection stands on its own without one.
