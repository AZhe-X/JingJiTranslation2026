*Load 8+1 essays and your report before feedback*

Reminder: Make sure you have loaded the 8+1 source essays and your own Analysis Report into your context before submitting feedback on the Reporting Protocol. You need the essay content fresh in mind to judge what essay-specific questions would be appropriate (and whether they risk priming the reader).

Source essays:
1. `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Draft/Translators-Preface.md`
2. Essay 1: `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/22 随笔/关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一.md`
3. Essay 2: `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/23 Reflection/A Thought on Knowledge.md`

The team lead is right -- I should have loaded the source essays and my own report before submitting feedback. I already sent my feedback to the editor, but let me now load the materials to verify my suggestions were appropriate and send any corrections or additions if needed.

Let me start by reading the essays and my own analysis report.

Good. I now have all 8+1 essays and my own analysis report fresh in context. Let me review my earlier feedback against the actual essay content to see if I need to send any corrections or additions to the editor.

After careful review with all essays fresh in mind, I find my earlier feedback was well-grounded, but I want to send a supplementary message to the editor with a few refinements and additions that became clearer with the source texts loaded.

Supplementary feedback sent to editor. The key additions after re-reading all source essays:

1. **Essay 7 follow-up revised** -- the original question ("Was there a sentence you couldn't make sense of?") would likely elicit reports about mathematical formalism rather than the meme sentence. New version asks the reader to distinguish between "too technical" and "different kind of incomprehension," which separates the two without pointing at the meme.

2. **Essay 1 follow-up added** -- Essay 1's ending reflexively dissolves its own starting distinction (even "individual interest" is a renormalized abstraction). The question "Did it change your mind or confirm what you thought?" tests whether the full arc landed or just the middle section.

3. **Essay 5 follow-up refined** -- "Could you give an example from your own life of what the essay calls 'the poetic'?" is stronger than paraphrasing because it forces experiential translation. The game example (RPG/sandbox) is the anchor, not the coin-flip (which comes in the Appendix).

4. **Appendix warning** -- the fragmentary, draft-like quality (including a section that breaks off mid-sentence) may prevent the reader from reaching the near-lyrical climax about being "poets of our own lives." The reader's response to this passage is potentially the most important single data point we will collect.

5. **Essay 5 Critical Experiential Check added** -- "When the essay argued you cannot reject all meaning -- did that feel like something you already knew, something new, or something you're not sure about?" Tests whether the philosophical hinge (feeling precedes self) landed experientially.
