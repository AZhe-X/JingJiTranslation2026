*AGREE — no objections, Buddhist coverage is complete*

**AGREE**

The Buddhist connections in Section B now explicitly include Hua-yen's Indra's net and pratityasamutpada alongside Madhyamaka, Yogacara, and Chan — exactly what I recommended. The Afterword blueprint is comprehensive and well-structured. The three Preface edits are clean. No objections.
