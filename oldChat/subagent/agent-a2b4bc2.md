*Load 8+1 essays and your report before feedback*

Reminder: Make sure you have loaded the 8+1 source essays and your own Analysis Report into your context before submitting feedback on the Reporting Protocol. You need the essay content fresh in mind to judge what essay-specific questions would be appropriate (and whether they risk priming the reader).

Source essays:
1. `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Draft/Translators-Preface.md`
2. Essay 1: `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/22 随笔/关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一.md`
3. Essay 2: `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/23 Reflection/A Thought on Knowledge.md`
4. Essay 3: `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/22 随笔/西西弗斯、班与猫.md`
5. Essay 4: `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录/后形而上学 整理.md`
6. Essay 5: `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录/形而上学后的目的：诗意.md`
7. Essay 6: `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录/范畴论与境 整理.md`
8. Essay 7: `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录/范畴论与境：K1策略.md`
9. Appendix: `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录/关于诗意和境的一些零散想法.md`

Your own report is in your workspace directory under `Analysis Report.md`.

I already submitted my feedback to the editor before this reminder arrived. However, I do have the Appendix (Essay 8) and the Essay 4 draft in context from earlier reads, and I have the detailed Step 1 memo notes in Profile.md covering all 8+1 essays. My feedback was based on that knowledge.

That said, I'm the translator, not an expert — my workspace doesn't have an "Analysis Report.md." My working document is the memo notes embedded in Profile.md.

Clarified to team lead that I already submitted feedback and that I'm a translator (no Analysis Report). Standing by for further instructions.
