*Vote on Foreword — yes/no/optional, with reasons*

ALL TEAM MEMBERS (experts, translator-2, editor):

Vote: **Should this collection include a Foreword?**

Reminder: A Foreword is written by someone other than the author or translator — typically a scholar, philosopher, or expert who can position the work for the reader. The Translator's Preface (DRAFT-R2) is already done and confirmed.

The question is: in addition to the Translator's Preface, should there be a Foreword?

Options:
- **YES** — include a Foreword
- **NO** — Translator's Preface is sufficient
- **OPTIONAL** — nice to have but not necessary

Please vote AND give a brief reason (1-2 sentences). Everyone votes.

A foreword by a philosopher working at the intersection of epistemology and formal methods (or philosophy of mind and category theory) could helpfully signal to Western readers that the author's deflationary treatment of JTB and the categorical formalization of knowledge formation are genuine contributions, not amateur philosophy — which is a risk when a non-philosopher publishes philosophical work. However, the Translator's Preface already positions the work effectively, and the essays themselves demonstrate their rigor through the \"philosophical experiments\" they conduct on the reader. A foreword is not necessary for the collection to succeed.",
