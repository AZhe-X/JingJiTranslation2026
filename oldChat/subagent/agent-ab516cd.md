*Hybrid: Jing footnoted as *

The author proposes a hybrid solution for the 境/梦境 link:

- 境 stays as **Jing** (romanized, primary term)
- But when first introducing Jing, a footnote glosses it with a "-scape" coinage — something like "living-scape" — establishing that **-scape = 境** in the reader's mind
- Then 梦境 = **"dreamscape"** naturally contains the -scape root, and the reader sees the connection: dream-**scape** contains **-scape** = 境

This way:
- "dreamscape" stays natural and readable (Camp B wins)
- The morphological link is visible (Camp A wins)
- The -scape family works: dreamscape, and any other 境-compounds

Question: Does this work? And what would be the best "-scape" gloss for 境 in the footnote? "Living-scape"? "Experience-scape"? Something else? Brief responses.

The -scape suffix is doing exactly the right work: it means \"a structured expanse or field\" (from landscape, seascape, soundscape), which maps well onto 境 as \"a structured experiential field.\" The reader who sees \"dreamscape\" will unconsciously parse dream + scape, and the footnote makes the scape = 境 link explicit.\n\n**For the gloss, my recommendation: \"experiencescape\"**\n\nJustification from the phenomenological side:\n\n- **\"Living-scape\"**: Too close to Husserl's Lebenswelt (lifeworld). Would import the connotation of a pre-given, shared world, whereas the author's 境 is individually structured and actively constructed.

Sent my response. I endorse the hybrid approach and recommend "experiencescape" as the gloss -- it maps directly onto the author's definition of 境 as a structured field on P (the totality of experience), avoids the Lebenswelt connotations of "living-scape," and is broader than "feeling-scape." The key is that the gloss illuminates the morphology then recedes, with "Jing" remaining the primary term. Standing by.
