*Translation question: best rendering of 诗意*

I'm the translator for the 境集 collection. I need your expert opinion on the best English rendering of 诗意 (shiyi) — the author's central positive concept.

Context: 诗意 is the author's name for the proper post-nihilistic stance — a lucid, knowing engagement with meaning-structures, aware they are constructed yet fully invested in them. It is identified with 清醒的梦境 (the lucid dreamscape). It is NOT poetry or aesthetics in the literary sense — it is an existential mode of being.

Your analysis report compared it with:
- Nietzsche's amor fati (author's is quieter, more like cat-raising than Dionysian ecstasy)
- Camus's revolt (author supersedes it — cat-raiser has nothing to revolt against)
- Heidegger's Gelassenheit (author's is more active/agentic)

My question: Which English rendering best captures the existential weight without misleading the reader?

Options:
1. **"the Poetic"** (capitalized, as philosophical stance). Resonates with Heidegger's "das Dichterische." Risk: sounds aesthetic to English ears.
2. **"poiesis"** (Greek: making, bringing-forth). More technical, captures creative dimension. Risk: obscure, may import unwanted Greek baggage.
3. **"poetic dwelling"** — descriptive, Heideggerian. Risk: over-identifies with Heidegger.
4. **Something else** — "lucid engagement," "knowing play," "creative dwelling," etc.

Which do you recommend, and why? Would you suggest different renderings for different contexts (e.g., one for the essay title, another for inline usage)?

Poiesis also has a Heideggerian technical usage (\"The Ques

Sent my detailed recommendation to the translator. Summary: "the poetic" is the best rendering -- it preserves the Chinese term's metaphorical extension from literary genre to existential mode, has Continental philosophical precedent beyond just Heidegger, is grammatically flexible, and the aesthetic misreading is self-correcting in context. I also provided context-specific variants for title, substantive, adjectival, and first-occurrence usage.
