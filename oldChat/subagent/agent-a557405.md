*Vote on Afterword — yes/no/optional, with reasons*

ALL TEAM MEMBERS:

New question from the author: **Since we decided the work doesn't need an external introduction BEFORE the essays, should there be an Afterword AFTER the essays?**

For example, an editor's afterword, a translator's afterword, or a critical afterword that discusses the work's significance, connections to other traditions, etc. — placed AFTER the reader has completed the experiential sequences.

This would avoid the spoiler problem entirely (the reader has already experienced everything) while still providing the scholarly positioning, cross-traditional connections, and critical context that a Foreword would have provided.

Vote:
- **YES** — include an Afterword (say what kind)
- **NO** — not needed
- **OPTIONAL** — nice to have but not necessary

Brief reason (1-2 sentences).

This respects the author's own method — phenomena first, then the structures built upon them — by letting the reader have the experiences first and only then offering the scholarly apparatus for understandi

Voted YES for a Translator's Afterword. It's the structurally correct solution — avoids spoilers, respects the author's phenomena-first method, and provides the right place for cross-traditional scholarly analysis that can't go in the Preface without undermining the experiential sequences. Awaiting next task.
