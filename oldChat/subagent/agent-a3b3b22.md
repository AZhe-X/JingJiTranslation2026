All 10 votes are in — everyone APPROVED. Several submitted minor wording amendments on the Revision 7 probes. Please compile the final version now and broadcast it, or confirm the plan is finalized. No need to acknowledge individual feedback one by one — just produce the final Reporting Protocol revision plan.

Good — all 10 approved. Let me compile the final version now, incorporating the best wording from all submissions, and write the revised Reporting Protocol file.

The Reporting Protocol has been finalized and written to file. The modification timestamp has been updated (the file was touched by the system). The content is unchanged from what I wrote.

**Summary of what was accomplished:**

The Reporting Protocol has been revised from its original 5-section, 15-question structure to a comprehensive 7-section protocol with:

- **5 Preface questions** (was 3) — adding baseline expectation and spoiler detection
- **3-step per-essay process** with 7 general questions (was 5 flat questions) + marginal notes collection + 2 targeted apparatus questions for specific essays
- **5 collection-level questions** (was 4) — adding Preface retrospective, refining wording
- **3 final prompts** (unchanged)
- **8 Critical Experiential Checks** (was 3) — covering every essay and the Appendix
- **1 optional re-read test** (new) — experimental probe for Essay 3 order-dependence
- **4 internal analysis notes** (new) — for the team's use when interpreting results

The protocol is now **FINAL (pending implementation)**, ready for the standby reader whenever we have finished translation drafts to test. Awaiting next task from the team lead.
