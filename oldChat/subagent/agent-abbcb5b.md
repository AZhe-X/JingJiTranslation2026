*Format for classical Chinese quotes: original + glossed English + plain English after?*

Question from the author about rendering classical Chinese (文言) quotations in the translation:

Proposed format: When a classical Chinese passage is quoted (e.g., from the Yijing, Lunyu, Daodejing, or the author's own 道德仁义礼 sequence analysis), the translation would:

1. **Present the original Chinese text** (文言)
2. **Follow with English translation** that includes inline romanization and Chinese for key terms on first occurrence — e.g., "humaneness (仁, ren)" — and later uses just the English, e.g., "phenomenal humaneness"
3. **After that first introduction**, use only the English rendering (e.g., "humaneness") in running text

So the reader sees:
- The original 文言 text (preserved)
- An English translation with key terms glossed on first appearance
- Pure English thereafter

Is this a good approach? Does it balance accessibility with fidelity to the source? Any concerns about cluttering the text, or about how to handle terms that appear in both 文言 quotations and the author's own modern Chinese? Keep your response concise.

It is standard practice in English-language sinological scholarship (Ames & Rosemont's Analerta, Van Norden's translations, Ziporyn's Zhuangzi all use this pattern).

Distinguish the author's technical reinterpretations from standard glosses.** The Daodejing passage is the critical case. The author's 道-德-仁-义-礼 analysis reinterprets these terms within the framework: 道 becomes something like Zeroth Reality, 礼 becomes phenomenal. When the author writes \"现象礼\" or \"现象仁,\" these are neologisms -- \"phenomenal-Li,\" \"phenomenal-Ren.\" The
