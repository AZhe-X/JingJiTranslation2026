*Clarify editor's orchestration role*

Clarification: Your role here is to ORCHESTRATE, not just submit your own feedback. You should have received feedback from 9 other team members (chinese-phil, epistemology, buddhism, kantian, metaphysics, translator-2, phil-mind, wittgenstein, phenomenology — existentialism-expert is still pending). 

Your job: 
1. Collect all submissions (including your own views)
2. Synthesize a unified revision plan for the Reporting Protocol
3. Send the plan back to all experts for discussion
4. Back and forth until agreement

Please proceed with the synthesis once existentialism-expert's feedback arrives (or start now with the 9 you have).

Understood — I need to collect and synthesize all the feedback that's been sent to me. Let me check what I've received so far.

Now I need to request the feedback from all 9 experts who have submitted. Let me message each one to ask for their feedback if they haven't already sent it to me, or to confirm receipt if they have. Actually, the team lead said I "should have received" feedback — let me check if messages have been arriving. The experts may have sent messages that I need to read. Let me request their submissions.

I've sent requests to all 9 experts and the second translator for their feedback on the Reporting Protocol. I'm now waiting for their responses to come in so I can synthesize everything into a unified revision plan.

While I wait, let me also check if the translator (the main one, who is orchestrating the Reporting Protocol document) has sent me any responses to my earlier feedback.

I'll proceed with synthesis as soon as I start receiving responses. The plan is:

1. Collect all 10 submissions (9 experts + translator-2) plus my own views
2. Identify areas of consensus and disagreement
3. Draft a unified revision plan
4. Send it back to all contributors for discussion
5. Iterate until agreement

Now idle and awaiting the expert responses.
