*Weight profile dimensions + vote on *

**Two items for the standby reader profile:**

**Item 1: Weight each profile dimension by significance (out of 10).**

Score each dimension from 1-10 for how important it is to getting the right standby reader:

- A. Education level (graduate-level humanities)
- B. No philosophy specialization
- C. No category theory / formal math
- D. No prior exposure to these essays or our materials
- E. Basic cultural literacy (Sisyphus, metaphysics, Laozi)
- F. Comfort with abstract ideas and sustained argument
- G. Tolerance for foreign terms and mathematical notation on page
- H. Curious and patient disposition
- I. Honest about confusion / not deferential
- J. **Experientially attentive** — notices what happens to them while reading
- K. Life experience (has worked a job, owned a pet, faced decisions)
- L. Reads literary fiction / attentive to prose quality

**Item 2: Vote on "Tell a friend what this is about" as a final prompt.**

The editor proposed asking the standby reader, after completing the full collection: "What would you tell a friend this collection is about?"

Vote: **YES** (keep this prompt) or **NO** (suggest a different/better final prompt).

If they've seen our materials or the essays, the entire test is compromised. The experiential sequences must be encountered cold.\n- **J:10** — This is what distinguishes a useful standby reader from a proofreader. The collection's central claim is that the experience IS the argument. If the reader cannot notice what happens to them while reading, they cannot report on whether the experiential sequences work.\n- **I:9** — Honesty about confusion is almost as important as experiential attention. A deferential reader who pretends to understand will give us nothing useful.\n- *

Weights and vote submitted. Top priorities: no prior exposure (D=10), experiential attentiveness (J=10), honesty (I=9). YES on the "tell a friend" prompt — it tests whether the reader achieved genuine understanding in their own terms. Awaiting next task.
