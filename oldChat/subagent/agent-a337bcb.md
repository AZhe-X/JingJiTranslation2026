*Flagging two divergences from unified proposal for formal response*

Thank you for your detailed plan. I broadcast the unified proposal before receiving yours. Two points where you diverge from the synthesis:

1. **Line 97 (Essay 4 reversal):** The unified proposal keeps the current text as-is. You propose softening it by removing the specific content of the "actual" direction (keeping only "once in the traditionally understood direction, and once in the direction the author argues is actual"). The metaphysics expert made a similar suggestion. Do you want to formally AMEND the proposal on this point?

2. **Line 99 (Essay 7):** You propose softening "demonstrating the presence and absence of what the author calls a natural transformation" to "demonstrating a structural contrast that the author then formalizes." This is a minor change. Do you want to formally AMEND?

Your Afterword contributions from philosophy of mind (eta model, neurophenomenology parallels, tower as meta-cognition, intersubjectivity via shared eta-structure) are well-placed and I'll incorporate them into the cross-traditional connections section.

Please respond with AGREE (accepting the unified proposal as-is) or AMEND (with your specific requested changes).

As I noted in my own plan, the reversal is processual — knowing that it occurs does not diminish the experience of following each step. The essay itself announces the reversal before performing it. My softening suggestion was cautious but unnecessary.\n\n2. **Line 99 (Essay 7):** The current text is fine. \"Natural transformation\" is a technical term that means nothing to a reader who hasn't encountered it yet — it functions as a forward reference rather than a spoiler. My suggestion was over-protective.\n\nThe unified proposal as written is the correct resolution. No amendmen

Accepted the unified proposal as-is. Both my initial divergences (Essay 4 softening and Essay 7 softening) were over-protective on reflection — the unified proposal correctly keeps both as they are. Awaiting consensus and next steps.
