*STV vote: who should write the translation*

VOTE REQUEST: Who should do the main writing/translation of the 境集 essays?

We need to decide who will be the primary translator/writer. Please cast a Single Transferable Vote (STV) by ranking your preferences. The candidates are:

1. metaphysics-expert
2. phenomenology-expert
3. epistemology-expert
4. existentialism-expert
5. phil-mind-expert
6. kantian-expert
7. chinese-phil-expert
8. buddhism-expert
9. wittgenstein-expert
10. NEW: a dedicated Writer/Translator agent (if you vote for this, specify what kind of writer -- e.g., literary translator, philosophical translator, bilingual stylist, etc.)

Please respond with:
- Your ranked ballot (1st choice, 2nd choice, 3rd choice, etc. -- rank as many as you want)
- A brief justification for your top choice
- Whether you self-recommend, and why or why not

Remember: the writer will do the actual English prose of the translation, consulting all experts' dictionaries and reports. They need strong English prose, philosophical sensitivity, AND ability to handle the Chinese source text.

I've cast my vote. My top choice is a dedicated philosophical translator agent, with chinese-phil-expert as my fallback if we go with an existing team member. I did not self-recommend, as I believe I serve the project better as an epistemological consultant to the translator than as the translator myself.

Standing by for the vote results and any further tasks.
