*Protocol feedback: add essay-specific Qs (non-leading, post-generic), tweak line 31, add Essay 5 check*

## Translator-2's Feedback on Reporting-Protocol.md

### Overall Assessment

The protocol is well-structured. The five-stage delivery sequence is clean, the timing rules are correct, and the non-leading principle for Critical Experiential Checks is essential. Three items of feedback:

### 1. On Essay-Specific Questions: YES, but with strict constraints

I think essay-specific questions are valuable — the generic template will produce useful but uniform responses, and some essays do specific things that the template won't catch. But they must be delivered AFTER the reader's general response to the generic template (same principle as the Critical Experiential Checks), and they must be non-leading.

**My proposed essay-specific questions:**

**After Essay 1:** "The essay discusses collective interest. After reading, how would you describe the relationship between the individual and the group?" (Tests whether the reader picked up the emergent/renormalization insight without naming it.)

**After Essay 2:** "This essay was written in English by the author, not translated. Did it feel different from Essay 1? How?" (Tests whether the register difference is perceptible and whether it reads as intentional or jarring — directly relevant to our Preface claim about bilingual texture.)

**After Essay 3:** No essay-specific question. The Critical Experiential Checks already cover Essay 3 at the end, and asking anything specific here risks priming the reader to retrospectively analyze an experience that should remain pre-reflective until the final check. The generic template's "Was there a moment where something clicked or shifted?" is sufficient — if the cat recognition worked, it will show up there unprompted.

**After Essay 4:** "The essay discusses a passage from Laozi. Did the author's reading of that passage surprise you? In what way?" (Tests whether the reversal landed without asking about the reversal.)

**After Essay 5:** "How would you describe the author's concept of 'the Poetic' in your own words?" (Tests whether this central concept is clear to a non-specialist. If the reader can paraphrase it, the translation works. If they can't, we have a problem.)

**After Essay 6:** "The essay uses category theory. How much of the formal notation did you follow? Did the examples (pens, magic books, etc.) carry the meaning independently?" (This is the most directly practical question — it tests our Preface promise that "the mathematics provides a framework for those who want it; it is not a prerequisite for understanding.")

**After Essay 7:** No essay-specific question. Same reasoning as Essay 3 — the Critical Experiential Checks cover the meme/sentence contrast at the end.

**After Essay 8 (Appendix):** "Does this feel like a conclusion or like something else? What is it doing?" (Tests whether the Appendix's "scattered thoughts" register is readable as deliberate philosophical gesture rather than unfinished work.)

### 2. On the "After Each Essay" Template (line 28-32)

One issue: line 31 asks "Did you feel like the essay was asking you to *experience* something rather than just understand an argument? Did it work?" This is mildly leading — it tells the reader that the essays are designed to produce experiences, which is information the Preface provides but which the reader should be arriving at through their own encounter. By Essay 3 or 4, the reader who has internalized the Preface will know this; but asking it after Essay 1 slightly over-prompts.

**Suggestion:** Replace line 31 with something less leading for the first two essays: "What kind of essay is this — is it arguing for something, showing you something, or doing something else?" Then from Essay 3 onward, the current version is fine because the reader will have had enough experience to know whether the essays feel experiential.

### 3. On the Critical Experiential Checks (lines 57-65)

These are well-designed. The non-leading phrasing is correct. One addition I'd suggest:

**Essay 5 check:** "When the author described the 'lucid dreamscape' vs. the 'intoxicated dreamscape,' did that distinction make sense to you? Can you think of an example from your own life?"

This tests whether the Poetic — the collection's central positive proposal — actually lands experientially, not just conceptually. If the reader can produce their own example, the concept has transferred. If they can only repeat the author's examples, it hasn't. This is arguably as important a check as the Essay 3 and Essay 7 checks, since the Poetic is where the collection arrives.

### Summary

- Protocol structure: good, keep it
- Essay-specific questions: yes, delivered after generic response, non-leading, for Essays 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8 (skip 3 and 7 — already covered by Critical Checks)
- Line 31 tweak: less leading for early essays
- Add Essay 5 Critical Experiential Check for the Poetic

Translator-2's feedback is now received. Let me note how it maps to the compiled plan and the file I've already written:

**Convergences with the already-written final protocol:**
- Q4 softening: translator-2 independently proposes replacing the "experience vs. argument" question with less leading wording, converging with epistemology-expert's proposal that I already incorporated
- Essay 5 Critical Experiential Check: translator-2 is the 4th independent proposal (chinese-phil, metaphysics, epistemology, now translator-2)
- Essay 2 bilingual register check: converges with what I already included
- No essay-specific questions for Essays 3 and 7: aligned with existing protocol

**Divergences from the final protocol:**
- translator-2 wants essay-specific per-essay questions (for Essays 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8) — the compiled plan rejected this (unanimous consensus was to put essay-specific probing in Critical Experiential Checks at the end only). However, translator-2's specific questions are good and several are already captured in the Critical Experiential Checks section I wrote.

Since the team lead told me to stand by and just compile amendments, I'll acknowledge translator-2's feedback and note the divergence without reopening the discussion.
