*梦境 contains 境 — should translation preserve this link?*

Question from the author: 梦境 contains the character 境 — the same 境 as in the title 境集 and the central concept 境 (Jing). But "dreamscape" (and most proposed translations) doesn't capture this connection. The reader of the English text would not see that 梦境 literally contains 境.

Does this matter? Should the translation of 梦境 somehow preserve the 境 connection? If so, how?

Brief responses welcome. This is a real translation problem.

Sent my response. I argued this matters significantly -- the 梦境 -> 境 relationship is philosophically load-bearing, not merely etymological. Proposed "dream-Jing" as the rendering, which preserves the morphological containment (dream-Jing contains Jing, just as 梦境 contains 境) and reproduces the conceptual distillation the reader experiences when the author later drops the prefix. Standing by.
