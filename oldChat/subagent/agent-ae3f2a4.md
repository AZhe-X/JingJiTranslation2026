*Romanized terms kill the philosophical experiment*

The author raises a critical point about the "philosophical experiment" argument:

If we romanize everything — Dao, De, Ren, Yi, Li — then the passage has NO English semantic content for the Western reader. The reader encounters five opaque foreign terms in a sequence. The "philosophical experiment" (where the reader first accepts a conventional understanding, then watches it get deconstructed) CANNOT work, because the reader never had a conventional understanding to begin with. The romanized terms have very few morphisms in their Jing — they are semantically empty for the English reader.

The experiment requires the reader to FEEL something when they read "virtue," "humaneness," "righteousness" — to bring their own associations — and THEN experience the reversal. If they just see "De, Ren, Yi, Li," they have nothing to reverse. The passage becomes an abstract report about foreign concepts rather than a lived philosophical experience.

Does this change your thinking? Should we use English translations (the Way, virtue, humaneness, rightness, ritual conduct) in the block quote precisely SO the philosophical experiment works on the English reader?

Reconsider. Brief response.

The author is right.\n\nThe philosophical experiment depends on the reader having semantic skin in the game. \"Virtue\" carries moral weight in English — the reader feels it, brings their Aristotelian and Christian associations to it, and then experiences the shock when the author deconstructs it. \"De\" carries nothing for the English reader. It is a label, not a concept they inhabit.\n\nThe same applies down the chain: \"humaneness\" makes the reader think of compassion, care, moral feeling — then the text shows that this too is a falling-away. \"Ren\" just sits there inert.\n\nSo yes: use full English translations in the block quote — the Way, virtue, humaneness, rightness, ritual co
