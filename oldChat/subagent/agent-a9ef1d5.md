*经验: empirical experience or experience?*

Quick confirmation needed on the 经验 (jīngyàn) entry in the Translation Dictionary.

Context: During the 感受 debate, the consensus term mapping was:
- 感受 → "feeling" (default) / "felt experience" (technical)
- 体验 → "experience" 
- 经验 → "empirical experience"
- 感觉 → "sensation"

The question: Should the standalone 经验 dictionary entry have **"empirical experience"** or **"experience"** as its MAIN translation?

Arguments for "empirical experience":
- Distinguishes clearly from 体验 ("experience") in the term mapping
- Captures the accumulated, reflected-upon, Erfahrung quality
- The author uses it in phrases like "经验的总结/预测/抽象" (summary/prediction/abstraction OF empirical experience) and "经验性的" (empirical)
- Prevents reader confusion between 体验 and 经验

Arguments for plain "experience":
- More natural in English
- "Empirical" is implicit in context
- Adding "empirical" every time could feel heavy

Please respond with your position: "empirical experience" or "experience" as main translation for 经验, with brief reasoning.

Translating as \"empirical experience's summary\" would be redundant and unnatural. \"Summary of experience,\" \"prediction from experience,\" \"abstraction from experience\" — these work cleanly.\n\n2. **经验性的 is where \"empirical\" belongs.** The author explicitly uses the adjectival form 经验性的 when they want to emphasize the empirical qual

Vote sent. My position: **"experience"** as the default for 经验, with "empirical" reserved for the adjectival 经验性的 or when 体验 appears in the same passage and disambiguation is needed. The key argument is that the author's own -性的 suffix already marks when the empirical quality needs emphasis; bare 经验 is simply accumulated experience (Erfahrung), and "experience" in English already carries that sense.
