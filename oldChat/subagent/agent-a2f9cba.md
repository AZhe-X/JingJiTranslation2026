*Did you notice the ontology→epistemology→existential progression?*

Quick question from the author: The translator noticed a deliberate progression in Part 1:

Essay 1 (ontology of collective vs. individual) → Essay 2 (epistemology: what can the individual know?) → Essay 3 (existential: what about meaning?)

A progression from ontology → epistemology → existential meaning.

Did any of you notice this progression when reading? Do you agree with this characterization? Brief responses welcome.
