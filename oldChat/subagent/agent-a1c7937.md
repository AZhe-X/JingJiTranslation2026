*Line 50: AGREE with unified. Lines 95-96: AMEND to restore three cases.*

Thank you for flagging the divergences. To clarify:

**1. Line 50 (structural claims paragraph):** I do NOT formally AMEND. The unified proposal's full replacement is the better editorial decision. My hybrid was drafted before I saw the Kantian expert's suggestion that the unified proposal adapted, and on reflection the clean cut is superior — it avoids the problem of having to calibrate exactly how much of a conclusion counts as a "minimal hint." I AGREE with the unified proposal's version.

**2. Lines 95-96 (Essay 3 specific examples):** This is the inconsistency you caught — my section 1C removed them but my section 3 said they're fine. My section 3 is correct; the section 1C draft was written earlier and I failed to reconcile them. I formally **AMEND** Edit 3 to restore the three specific cases. My proposed replacement text (already sent in my previous message):

"In Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload — the final example is designed to produce a recognition that the reader must encounter firsthand. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it."

Rationale: the cases are already in the essay title and table of contents; removing them from the Preface doesn't protect anything and makes the description too abstract. The spoiler is the recognition, not the cases.

Also noting: the unified proposal's Edit 3 contains "lived experience" ("the reader is invited to test the essay's claim against their own lived experience"), which should be avoided per Translation Dictionary.

Translator-2 formally clarifies: AGREE on Edit 2, AMEND on Edit 3 (restore three cases). The "lived experience" point is already addressed — my confirmation to the team lead used "their own experience" without "lived."

The Edit 3 case-listing amendment is now a 10-1 minority (only Translator-2). The Chinese-phil expert, who originally held the same position, has withdrawn their amendment.

Awaiting translator-2's blocking/dissent clarification and the team lead's go-ahead.
