*Protocol feedback: no essay-specific Qs, add checks for E1+E5, sequential delivery*

## REPORTING-PROTOCOL FEEDBACK — from phil-mind-expert

### Overall Assessment

The protocol is well-designed. The multi-stage delivery (general first, targeted after) and the non-leading framing of the Critical Experiential Checks are exactly right. The "delivery rule" at the top is essential and well-stated. A few suggestions:

### 1. The "After Each Essay" template — keep generic, do NOT add essay-specific questions

Regarding the project lead's suggestion about essay-specific questions alongside the generic ones: I recommend **against** this.

**Rationale from philosophy of mind:** Essay-specific questions, no matter how carefully worded, prime the reader for subsequent essays. If after Essay 1 we ask "Did the ocean/water-molecule analogy help you see collective interest differently?", the reader arrives at Essay 2 already in the mode of "I should be looking for analogies that shift my perspective." Worse: if after Essay 2 we ask anything about belief vs. knowledge, the reader arrives at Essay 3 with epistemological framing active, which could interfere with the phenomenological/experiential mode Essay 3 requires.

The generic template already captures what we need: (a) comprehension ("what was it about?"), (b) experiential effect ("did something click?"), (c) confusion ("what confused you?"), (d) methodological awareness ("did it ask you to experience something?"), (e) engagement ("did you want to keep reading?"). These are sufficient. The essay-specific probing belongs in the Critical Experiential Checks at the end, where we already have it — and where it cannot contaminate subsequent reading.

**One exception:** If we find after piloting that the generic responses are too thin to be useful, we could add ONE open-ended essay-specific prompt — but it should be delivered AFTER the generic response is submitted (same two-stage logic as the Critical Checks), and it should be non-leading. E.g., after Essay 1: "Is there anything else about this essay you want to mention?" This gives the reader space without direction. But I would start without this and add it only if needed.

### 2. Addition to Critical Experiential Checks: Essay 5 (The Poetic)

The current checks cover Essays 3, 4, and 7, but not Essay 5 (形而上学后的目的：诗意). This essay introduces the central positive concept of the collection — the Poetic, the intoxicated/lucid dreamscape distinction. I recommend adding:

- Essay 5: "The essay introduces the idea of '梦境' (dreamscape). Did you recognize the distinction the author draws? Does it connect to anything in your own experience?"

This tests whether the Poetic lands experientially, not just intellectually. It is arguably the most important concept in the entire collection for the reader's post-reading life.

### 3. Addition to Critical Experiential Checks: Essay 1

Essay 1's renormalization analogy (ocean/water-molecule) is a key test of whether the physics-as-philosophy method works for non-specialists:

- Essay 1: "The essay uses an analogy from physics. Did that analogy help or confuse you?"

This tests a specific claim in the Preface: that "the physics is doing genuine philosophical work."

### 4. Minor wording suggestion — "After Each Essay" question 4

Current: "Did you feel like the essay was asking you to *experience* something rather than just understand an argument? Did it work?"

This is slightly leading — it suggests the essay IS asking the reader to experience something. For the early essays (1 and 2), which are less overtly experiential, this could create a mismatch. Suggestion:

"What was the essay asking you to do — understand an argument, experience something, or both? Did it succeed?"

This lets the reader characterize the essay's mode themselves, which gives us better data about how the text registers.

### 5. The two-stage delivery within Critical Experiential Checks

The protocol says "Deliver ONLY after the final prompts are submitted." This is correct and important. But I want to flag: the three Critical Checks should ideally be delivered ONE AT A TIME (Essay 3 first, then Essay 4 after the Essay 3 response, then Essay 7 after the Essay 4 response). If all three are delivered simultaneously, the reader may compare them and construct a narrative across all three rather than reporting each experience independently. Sequential delivery preserves the independence of each response.

### 6. Confirm: the "tell a friend" prompts are excellent

Both "What would you tell a friend this collection is about?" and "What would you tell a friend it's *like* to read?" are exactly the right level. The second question ("what it's like") is particularly valuable — it captures the experiential texture of the reading process, not just content comprehension. Keep both.

### Summary

- Keep the generic per-essay template; do NOT add essay-specific questions (risk of cross-essay priming)
- Add Critical Experiential Checks for Essay 1 (physics analogy) and Essay 5 (the Poetic/dreamscape)
- Soften question 4 in the per-essay template to let the reader characterize the essay's mode themselves
- Deliver Critical Checks sequentially (one at a time), not simultaneously
- Everything else is well-designed. The protocol is ready with these adjustments.

Phil-mind-expert's feedback received. Strong convergences with the compiled plan:

**Convergences:**
- NO essay-specific per-essay questions: Aligns with majority (now 5 NO vs 3 YES)
- Essay 5 Critical Check: 8th independent proposal
- Essay 1 Critical Check: Converges with plan
- Q4 softening: 4th independent proposal
- "Tell a friend" prompts: Confirmed excellent

**New proposal:**
- Sequential delivery of Critical Experiential Checks (one at a time, not all at once): This is an excellent methodological point I hadn't considered. Delivering all 8 probes simultaneously would let the reader construct a cross-essay narrative rather than reporting each independently. Sequential delivery preserves independence.
