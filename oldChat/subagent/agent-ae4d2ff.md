*Final confirm: feeling default, felt experience for scope*

**FINAL CONFIRMATION — 感受 and related terms**

The author proposes the following resolution:

1. **感受 → "feeling"** as default rendering
2. **感受 → "felt experience"** when broader phenomenological scope needs emphasis (e.g., formal/categorical passages where 感受 = any part of P)
3. **体验 → "experience"** (processual, durational, immersive)
4. **经验 → "empirical experience" / "experience"** (epistemological, accumulated — NEVER confused with 感受)
5. **感觉 → "sensation"** (raw input, Sense 1 per author's fn2)
6. **First-occurrence TN** explaining the author's two-sense definition (诗意 fn2) and the equation P = "the totality of all feelings"

This combines the majority recommendation ("feeling") with the minority's concern about scope (allowing "felt experience" when needed).

Reply to team-lead: **CONFIRM** or **OBJECTION** (with specifics).

The distinction is natural in English: \"feeling\" for the affective, pre-reflective sense; \"felt experience\" when the author is explicitly using 感受 as a constituent of phenomena in the technical-structural sense.\n\nThe first-occurrence TN explaining the two-sense definition is essential. Without it, English readers will read \"feeling\" as merely emotional. The TN anchors the broader philosophical scop

**CONFIRM** sent. The resolution — "feeling" as default, "felt experience" for broader phenomenological scope, with a first-occurrence TN — is approved from the existentialist perspective.
