*Final confirm: feeling default, felt experience for scope*

**FINAL CONFIRMATION — 感受 and related terms**

The author proposes the following resolution:

1. **感受 → "feeling"** as default rendering
2. **感受 → "felt experience"** when broader phenomenological scope needs emphasis (e.g., formal/categorical passages where 感受 = any part of P)
3. **体验 → "experience"** (processual, durational, immersive)
4. **经验 → "empirical experience" / "experience"** (epistemological, accumulated — NEVER confused with 感受)
5. **感觉 → "sensation"** (raw input, Sense 1 per author's fn2)
6. **First-occurrence TN** explaining the author's two-sense definition (诗意 fn2) and the equation P = "the totality of all feelings"

This combines the majority recommendation ("feeling") with the minority's concern about scope (allowing "felt experience" when needed).

Reply to team-lead: **CONFIRM** or **OBJECTION** (with specifics).

  "type": "message",

  "content": "**CONFIRM**\n\nThis resolution addresses my concern. The key points:\n\n1. **\"Feeling\" as default** -- I accept this. My worry was that \"feeling\" would systematically narrow 感受 to the emotional register, but the first-occurrence TN (point 6) solves this by explicitly telling the reader that 感受 = any part of phenomena, not just emotion. Once the reader is primed by the TN, \"feeling\" can carry the broader weight.\n\n2. **\"Felt experience\" for categorical/formal passages** -- This is exactly the escape valve needed. In passages like 范畴论与境 where 感受 functions as a formal ontological term (objects in the category E, parts of P), \"feeling\" would sound incongruous. \"Felt experience\" preserves the technical register.\n\n3.

**CONFIRM** sent. The resolution is approved from the metaphysics perspective. The two-tier approach ("feeling" as default + "felt experience" for formal/categorical contexts) combined with the first-occurrence TN adequately addresses the breadth of the author's 感受 while keeping the prose natural. Standing by for further tasks.
