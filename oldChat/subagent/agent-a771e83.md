*Feedback already submitted earlier — confirming receipt*

I already submitted my full feedback to you earlier in this session — it included four main suggestions: (1) de-philosophize line 31 by replacing the experience/argument distinction with an open-ended question, (2) add essay-specific follow-ups for Essays 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 delivered after generic responses, (3) add a Fish/Fishing retrospective question to the collection-level section, and (4) consider merging the collection-level report and final prompts into one stage. Let me know if you didn't receive it or need me to resend.
