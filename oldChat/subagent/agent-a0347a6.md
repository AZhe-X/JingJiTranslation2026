*Proceed with majority positions, produce final proposal*

Proceed with majority positions on all 4 open questions. You've done thorough follow-ups with everyone. The margins are clear enough:

1. Line 97: KEEP as-is (6 vs 3)
2. Line 50: Full removal to topic-only (8 vs 2)
3. Lines 95-96: Remove specific listing (majority)
4. Afterword length: 3,000-4,000 words (4 vs 3 — go with the longer range since the cross-traditional section needs room)

Produce the final revised proposal incorporating majority positions + accepted Afterword amendments (Hua-yen, Zeroth Reality, existentialist points, etc.). Broadcast for final AGREE/DISAGREE.
