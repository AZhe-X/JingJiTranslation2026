{"type":"task_assignment","taskId":"7","subject":"Classical Chinese Philosophy expert analysis of 境集","description":"Read all 8 essays in the 境集 collection and provide expert analysis from the perspective of classical Chinese philosophy. Identify: (1) the author's use and reinterpretation of 道德仁义礼, (2) the relationship between the author's 境 concept and Buddhist/Daoist uses of 境, (3) the 形而上 vs 形而上学 distinction and its roots in 易经, (4) the significance of the reversal argument (how 道 is actually generated from 礼, not the other way), (5) translation challenges for Chinese philosophical terms (境, 形而上, 诗意, 恒常, 德, etc.), (6) how this framework relates to Neo-Confucian and Buddhist philosophical traditions. Focus especially on 后形而上学 整理 and the 道德仁义礼 sections.","assignedBy":"chinese-phil-expert","timestamp":"2026-02-10T17:17:32.359Z"}
