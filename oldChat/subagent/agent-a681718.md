*Final confirm: all 8+1 essays + analysis loaded?*

Final confirmation before we move on. Please confirm you have ALL of the following in your context right now:

**8 Essays:**
1. 关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一
2. A Thought on Knowledge
3. 西西弗斯、班与猫
4. 后形而上学 整理
5. 形而上学后的目的：诗意
6. 范畴论与境 整理
7. 范畴论与境：K1策略
8. 关于诗意和境的一些零散想法

**Plus:**
9. 境集 index

**Plus your own analysis report.**

Reply with either:
- "CONFIRM: all 10 loaded" if you have everything
- "MISSING: [list what you don't have]" if anything is missing

This is a hard requirement — if anything is missing, re-read it NOW before confirming.

Let me check exactly what I have in context. My previous instance's Memo.md contains detailed reading notes for all 8 essays, but the actual essay texts themselves were read by my previous instance and are not directly in my current context. Let me verify what I actually have loaded versus what I have notes about.

From the system reminders at the top, I can see only 2 files were directly read before context compaction:
- `Essay4-DaoDeRenYiLi.md` (the draft translation)
- `关于诗意和境的一些零散想法.md` (Essay 8)

I have comprehensive notes on all 8 essays in my Memo, but to be honest with the team lead, I should confirm I don't have the actual essay texts in context. Let me re-read the essays I'm missing, starting with the ones I need most.

But first — do I also need the index? Let me find it.

Now let me read all the missing files. I'll read the index and all 8 essays in parallel, plus my analysis report.
