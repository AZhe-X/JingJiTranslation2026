*What English word to pair with romanized De?*

Follow-up from the author on 德:

The decision to romanize as "De" is settled. But per our established 文言 convention, the first occurrence format is: "English (德 De)" — then plain English thereafter.

The question now is: what English word goes in that slot?

Options on the table:
1. "virtue (德 De)" — then "virtue" in running text
2. "inherent character (德 De)" — then "inherent character" in running text  
3. "defining character (德 De)" — then "defining character" in running text
4. "character (德 De)" — then "character" in running text
5. Something else?

Remember: this English word will be used in running text after the first glossed occurrence. It needs to work for the author's constructivist usage (what makes a thing what it is, constructed bottom-up from phenomena, applies to ALL things not just moral agents).

What is your recommendation for the English part?

Good question — this is the practical follow-through on the assessment. Let me think carefully about what word will sit in running text every time 德 appears after the first gloss.

Let me re-read the key passage one more time to make sure I'm precise about what the word needs to do.

Now let me also check the footnote 24 which clarifies the author's usage further.

Good. Now I have the full picture. Let me formulate my recommendation.

Assessment sent. I recommended **"defining nature"** as the English word to pair with romanized De, with a detailed comparison table testing all options against three key sentence patterns from the author's text:

- **"Virtue"** -- already rejected, moral connotation
- **"Inherent character"** -- "inherent" contradicts the constructivist argument
- **"Defining character"** -- "character" has too many competing English senses
- **"Character"** alone -- ambiguous, reads as personality
- **"Defining nature"** (recommended) -- "nature" has established philosophical sense ("the nature of X"), "defining" preserves the constructivist dimension (we assign De, we don't discover it), and it pairs with the author's own language about 定义 (definition)
- **"Nature"** alone offered as lighter fallback if brevity is preferred
