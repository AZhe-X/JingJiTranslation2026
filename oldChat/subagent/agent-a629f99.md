I have already completed this task. The full phenomenological analysis was sent to the team lead and task #2 has been marked as completed. The analysis covered all requested dimensions including the relationship to Husserl/Heidegger/Merleau-Ponty, the role of 感受/体验, translation challenges for 15+ key terms, and the significance of the P/E framework. No further action is needed.
