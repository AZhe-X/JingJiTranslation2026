*Does non-standard Laozi quote hurt author credibility?*

The author raises a concern: by NOT using a standard translation (e.g., Lau or Ivanhoe) for the Laozi block quote, are we putting the author at a disadvantage?

Potential risks:
- Scholars may see a non-standard rendering of a famous passage and question the author's sinological competence
- Reviewers might think the author doesn't know the standard translations
- Using our own terms in the block quote means the reader can't cross-reference with any published translation
- It could look like the author is being idiosyncratic where convention exists

Counter-argument (from our earlier discussion): consistency across quote and analysis matters more, and our terms (humaneness, rightness, ritual conduct) are all legitimate scholarly options.

Is this a real risk? Does departing from standard translations in a canonical block quote hurt the author's credibility? Brief response.

Response sent. The bottom line: the risk exists but is small because our terms ("humaneness," "rightness," "ritual conduct") are all recognized scholarly alternatives, not idiosyncratic inventions. A single TN citing the standard translation as a base ("Translation adapted from D.C. Lau (1963); key terms rendered in accordance with this translation's glossary") eliminates the risk entirely by demonstrating the author knows the tradition and is departing from it deliberately.
