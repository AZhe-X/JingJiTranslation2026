Let me check what I actually have in context. I've read the Translator's Preface (multiple times), the Essay 4 Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li draft, the Appendix essay (Essay 8), and the Profile. I have NOT read all 8 source essays directly — the Profile says "Do NOT re-read the source essays (your memo covers them)." I also haven't read my own Memo recently, though I've seen the summary of it in the Profile.

Let me check what's in my Editor directory.
