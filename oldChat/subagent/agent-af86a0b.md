*Quick vote: 虚无 context-dependent or fixed default?*

**QUICK VOTE: 虚无 (xūwú) — Disagreement #7**

The current recommendation is: use **"nothingness"** or **"the void"** depending on context, with both acceptable. Key rule: NEVER use "emptiness" (reserved for Buddhist 空/sunyata).

Do you agree with this context-dependent approach (both acceptable, translator chooses based on passage), or do you want ONE fixed default?

Reply to team-lead: **CONFIRM** (context-dependent, both acceptable) or **OBJECTION** (with your preferred single default and reasoning).

The author's 虚无 operates in both registers depending on the passage — sometimes as a philosophical concept (\"nothingness is not produced or created\"), sometimes as something existentially confronted (\"the ruins left behind are called nihilism\"). Locking in a single default would flatten this range.\n\nThe NEVER-emptiness rule for 空/śūnyatā distinction is correct and essential.",

**CONFIRM** on context-dependent 虚无 translation. "Nothingness" for abstract/conceptual registers, "the void" for spatial/experiential encounters. Both are valid, translator chooses per passage. The 空/śūnyatā firewall ("emptiness" reserved for Buddhist contexts) is essential and correct.
