*Review draft translation, send feedback to translator-2*

Please review the draft translation of the 道德仁义礼 passage from Essay 4 (后形而上学 整理).

**Original Chinese**: Read the original essay at: /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录/后形而上学 整理.md (lines 18-30 for the passage, and footnotes [^3], [^4], [^24] at lines 136-138, 172)

**Draft translation**: Read /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Draft/Essay4-DaoDeRenYiLi.md

Compare the draft against the original Chinese carefully. Then send your comments, suggestions, agreements, and any concerns **directly to translator-2** via message. Focus on your area of expertise (existentialism/nihilism) — authenticity of the "loss" and "burial" language, the existential weight of the reversals.

Now I have both texts fully before me. Let me do a close comparative reading, focusing on existentialist concerns — the structure of loss, concealment, reversal, and the burial of origins.

Review complete. I've sent detailed comments to translator-2 covering 8 points across the draft, and a summary to the team lead. The draft is strong from an existentialist perspective — the key structures of concealment, reversal, and forgetting are well preserved. My only substantive suggestion is changing "summarized from" to "abstracted from" or "distilled from" on line 38.
