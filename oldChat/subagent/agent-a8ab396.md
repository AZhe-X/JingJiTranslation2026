*Final review: Preface + Afterword blueprint — confirm or advise*

**Final review round.** Please read both documents and respond with **CONFIRM** or **ADVICE** (with specific suggestion):

1. **Translator's Preface (DRAFT-R3):**
`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Draft/Translators-Preface.md`

2. **Afterword Blueprint (updated):**
`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Editor/Afterword-Blueprint.md`

Check both for completeness, accuracy, and anything missing from your domain. This is the final check before we move on.

The redundancy fix is well-executed -- lines 44-48 now flow naturally from proverb/structure through experiential preview to reading recommendation, with \"The relationship between the two parts is itself part of the argument\" as a strong coda. The spoiler edits are invisible to a first-time reader (no seams). All sections maintain their purpose and voice.\n\nOne minor observation: Lines 48 and 105 both recommend sequential reading (\"We recommend that readers follow the author's prescribed order\" / \"The author recommends reading the essays in the ord
