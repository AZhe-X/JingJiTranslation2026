Context window check. Reply to team-lead with:

1. **Files in context:** Confirm you have all 8+1 source essays loaded. List whose Analysis Report or Memo you have (by name, e.g. "my own Metaphysics Analysis Report").

2. **What happened since the Reporting-Protocol vote:** Briefly list the key events/decisions you witnessed since the 11/11 vote to move "What to Report" to a standalone file. Just bullet points, no commentary.
