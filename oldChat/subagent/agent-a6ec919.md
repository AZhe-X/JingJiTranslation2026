*Add poet analysis to report if significant*

Your analysis of the author's 诗人 vs Heidegger's Dichter (the 5-point comparison: universal vs singular, creator vs receiver, self-directed vs community-founding, medium-indifferent vs language-bound, already doing it vs called to it) is not currently in your Analysis Report. 

Do you consider this a significant finding? If so, please add it to your report at `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Existentialism/Analysis Report.md` — either as a new section or integrated into the existing sections where it fits best.

Yes, this is a significant finding — it extends and sharpens the analysis of 诗意 that is already in Section 3 of my report, and it connects directly to the Appendix material discussed in Section 5. Let me read my current report to determine the best placement.

This is a significant finding that deserves its own section. The best placement is as a new Section 8, after the current Section 7 (Overall Significance) and before the Conclusion. It extends the analysis of 诗意 in Section 3 and connects to the Appendix material in Section 5, but it addresses a distinct concept (the poet as figure) rather than the Poetic as stance. I'll also update the translation challenges section (Section 6) with a note on 诗人.

Now let me confirm the edit was applied correctly.

Analysis Report updated. Section 8 (The Author's Poet vs. Heidegger's Dichter) has been added to `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Existentialism/Analysis Report.md`. The report now contains 8 numbered sections plus a Conclusion.

The core finding: the author's 诗人 resolves a persistent tension in the existentialist tradition between the exceptional and the everyday. Where Kierkegaard's knight of faith, Nietzsche's Ubermensch, Camus's absurd hero, and Heidegger's Dichter are all exceptional figures, the author's poet is ordinary by definition — everyone already is one. The philosophical question shifts from "How do I become authentic?" to "How do I notice that I already am?"

Waiting for further instructions.
