*Vote: poet vs Dichter finding — Preface, Afterword, or not included?*

**New finding from existentialism-expert:** The author's concept of the **poet (诗人)** vs Heidegger's **Dichter** — a significant difference not previously covered.

The author says in the Appendix: "我们正是这样的创造者，是自己生命和感受的诗人" — "We are precisely such creators, poets of our own lives and experiences."

**5 key differences from Heidegger's Dichter:**

1. **Universal vs singular** — "我们" (we), everyone is a poet; not a rare chosen figure like Holderlin
2. **Creator vs receiver** — paired with 创造者; the poet *makes*, not receives Being's disclosure
3. **Self-directed vs community-founding** — "自己生命和感受的诗人"; not founding dwelling for a historical people
4. **Medium-indifferent vs language-bound** — any medium works (desk arrangement, photography, cooking, memes); language has no priority
5. **Already doing it vs called to it** — "我们已经、正在、且也将继续"; the task is to *notice*, not to become

**Key insight:** The author shifts the question from "How do I become authentic?" to "How do I notice that I already am?"

**Vote:** Should this finding be included in:
- **A) The Translator's Preface**
- **B) The Translator's Afterword** (in the cross-traditional connections section)
- **C) Not included** (leave it in the expert report only)

Respond with A, B, or C, with brief reason.

The five-point comparison is substantive scholarship that enriches the reader's understanding *after* they have encountered the passage themselves. Putting it in the Preface would pre-interpret the Appendix's closing gesture, which is one of the collection's most powerful moments -- the shift from technical philosophical apparatus back to the universality of everyday experience (\"当我们布置我们的办公桌、当面对夕阳按下快门...\"). The reader should arrive at \"我们正是这样的创造者，是自己生命和感受的诗人\" with their own accumulated experience of the collection behind them, not with a Heideggerian comparison already loaded.\n\nIn the Afterword, th
