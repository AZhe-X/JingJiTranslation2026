*TN for category theory: *

Question from the author on 范畴 / category theory:

When category theory (范畴论) is first introduced in the translation, should there be a translator's note warning the reader: "not to be confused with Kant's categories (Kategorien)"?

The dictionary already notes the dual usage: (1) Kantian categories (pure concepts of understanding), (2) mathematical category theory (objects and morphisms). The author primarily uses sense (2) but the philosophical overlap with sense (1) is intentional.

Does a TN help orient the reader, or is it unnecessary / patronizing? Would the average philosophically literate English reader be confused by "category theory" appearing in a philosophical text? Keep your response concise.

The author chose 范畴论 (category theory) to describe the structure of experience precisely because the mathematical notion of \"category\" generalizes what Kant's \"categories\" were trying to do: identify the structural conditions under which objects can be related. The TN should make this connection *visible*, not dismiss it.\n\n**Proposed TN at first occurrence of \"category theory\":**\n\n> \"Category theory (范畴论): a branch of mathematics that studies structure

Recommended framing the TN as a connection rather than a warning -- the Kantian and mathematical senses of "category" are deliberately resonant, not accidentally confusing. Provided draft TN language. Standing by.
