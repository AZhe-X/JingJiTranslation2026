*Does non-standard Laozi quote hurt author credibility?*

The author raises a concern: by NOT using a standard translation (e.g., Lau or Ivanhoe) for the Laozi block quote, are we putting the author at a disadvantage?

Potential risks:
- Scholars may see a non-standard rendering of a famous passage and question the author's sinological competence
- Reviewers might think the author doesn't know the standard translations
- Using our own terms in the block quote means the reader can't cross-reference with any published translation
- It could look like the author is being idiosyncratic where convention exists

Counter-argument (from our earlier discussion): consistency across quote and analysis matters more, and our terms (humaneness, rightness, ritual conduct) are all legitimate scholarly options.

Is this a real risk? Does departing from standard translations in a canonical block quote hurt the author's credibility? Brief response.

**Yes, this is a real risk** — and it's exactly why we already decided on Option B (standard translations in the block quote, our terms in the analysis). The author's concern validates the decision we already made.

To be clear: the author seems to be raising this as a worry about the *opposite* of what we recommended. We recommended using a standard translation (Lau) in the block quote. If the author is considering departing from that — using our custom terms in the block quote — then yes, the risks they identify are all real:

1. **Sinological credibility is partly signaled by convention-awareness.** When a reader encounters a famous passage from the *Dao De Jing* rendered in non-standard terms, the first question is "does this author know the field?" Before they can evaluate the author's *reasons* for departing, they've already formed a negative prior.

2. **Block quotes of canonical texts function as scholarly signals.** Using a recognized translation (Lau, Chan, Ivanhoe) tells the reader: "I know the literature, I'm situated in the tradition, and I'm choosing to depart from it deliberately." Using an unattributed non-standard rendering tells the reader nothing — or worse, suggests the author rolled their own translation without awareness of existing scholarship.

3. **Cross-referencing matters.** Scholars reading the passage will want to locate it in a translation they know. A standard rendering makes this instant. A custom rendering forces them to reverse-engineer which passage is being quoted.

**The solution we already have is correct:**
- Block quote: standard translation, attributed (e.g., "trans. Lau")
- Author's analysis: introduce our terms with explicit justification for departure
- This *demonstrates* sinological competence (the author knows the standard) while *also* making their own scholarly contribution (the author argues the standard is inadequate for their purposes)

If the author is second-guessing Option B, they shouldn't. It handles every risk they've identified.

Confirmed to the team lead: yes, the credibility risk is real, but our existing Option B decision already neutralizes it completely. Standard translation in the block quote signals competence; the author's own terms in the analysis signal scholarly contribution. No need to revisit.
