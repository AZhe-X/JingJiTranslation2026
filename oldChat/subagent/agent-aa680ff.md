*形而上: *

Quick question from the author on 形而上 (xing er shang):

The current dictionary entry has the main translation as "the metaphysical" (substantive adjective). The author is asking: should it be "the metaphysical" or "metaphysical object"?

Consider: the author uses 形而上 to refer to constructions built upon phenomena (形/现象) that claim constancy/universality — all Second Reality content. The formal definition: "a metaphysical m is an association in E, and m is a universal property in some subcategory of E."

Which rendering is better and why? Is there a context where one works better than the other? Keep your response concise.

Calling 形而上 a \"metaphysical object\" would import exactly the substance-ontology that the author is working to dismantle -- it would suggest that every metaphysical construct is a *thing*, when the author's whole point is that m

Sent my response. The key argument: "metaphysical object" would import substance-ontology that the author is explicitly dismantling. The formal definition identifies 形而上 as morphisms (associations) with universal-property status, not as objects. "The metaphysical" for generic use, "metaphysical construct" for count-noun contexts. Never "metaphysical object."
