*What English word to pair with romanized De?*

Follow-up from the author on 德:

The decision to romanize as "De" is settled. But per our established 文言 convention, the first occurrence format is: "English (德 De)" — then plain English thereafter.

The question now is: what English word goes in that slot?

Options on the table:
1. "virtue (德 De)" — then "virtue" in running text
2. "inherent character (德 De)" — then "inherent character" in running text  
3. "defining character (德 De)" — then "defining character" in running text
4. "character (德 De)" — then "character" in running text
5. Something else?

Remember: this English word will be used in running text after the first glossed occurrence. It needs to work for the author's constructivist usage (what makes a thing what it is, constructed bottom-up from phenomena, applies to ALL things not just moral agents).

What is your recommendation for the English part?

That argument still holds, but now there is a stronger reason: none of the alternatives work in running text.\n\nTest each against the author's key sentence: \"凡事诸物皆有其德（我们认为他应该遵守的规律，使得一样东西成为其本身的东西）\"\n\n- \"All things have their **virtue**\" -- works. English philosophical tradition already uses \"virtue\" this way (the virtue of a knife is its sharpness; Aristotle's arete applies to tools and animals, not just moral agents). A philosophically literate reader will recognize this broader sense.\n- \"All things have their **inherent character*

Recommended "virtue" -- tested all alternatives against the author's key sentence and none work as well in running text. "Inherent character" contradicts the constructivist thesis, "defining character" is clunky on repetition, plain "character" is too vague. "Virtue" is the only single English word that applies to all things (not just moral agents), carries philosophical weight, and reads cleanly. The TN specifies the constructivist usage; "virtue" handles readability. Standing by.
