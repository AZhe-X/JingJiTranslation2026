*Vote yes/no on statement about needing external intro*

ALL TEAM MEMBERS:

Vote YES or NO on this statement (this is a philosophical judgment, not a decision about the book):

**"Whether or not to have a Foreword, a key judgment is: does this work need an introduction from others?"**

Vote YES if you agree with the statement.
Vote NO if you disagree.

One word is fine. No reasons needed.
