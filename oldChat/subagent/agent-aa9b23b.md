*Confirm Option B plan before sending to translator*

ALL 9 EXPERTS (not translator-2, not editor):

Before we send revision instructions to the translator, please confirm you agree with the following plan for shortening the Translator's Preface. This was decided in the previous round (9/9 unanimous) but we have 4 fresh agents, so confirming one last time.

---

**OPTION B: Move Key Terminological Decisions section to glossary introduction.**

The Preface currently has ~3,800 words. We will:

1. **MOVE** the entire Key Terminological Decisions section (~1,600 words, lines 85-161) out of the Preface and into a separate Glossary Introduction document. This includes: Jing/E, Metaphysical vs Metaphysics, Phenomena, Constancy, Non-Rational, The Poetic, Dreamscape, Vain Presumption, Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li, Three Realities, Stable Structures, Natural Transformations, Other Terms.

2. **REPLACE** that section with a brief bridging paragraph (3-4 sentences) that:
   - Notes the glossary exists and contains full terminological rationale
   - Flags the 德 split (two English words for one Chinese character in the same passage)
   - Mentions the 形而上 vs 形而上学 distinction (1 sentence)
   - Names the Poetic and Non-Rational as key concepts worth advance mention

3. **CUT** the working-draft quality paragraph from the Author section (~80 words) — redundant with Fish/Fishing and Reading Note.

4. **SIMPLIFY** the Bilingual Collection forward references — replace specific mentions of "digestion," "knowledge sub-category" with: "Three translator's footnotes within the essay connect its key terms to the formal apparatus of Part 2."

**KEEP unchanged:** On the Title, The Author (minus cut), Fish and Fishing, A Bilingual Collection (simplified), Reinterpretation of 形, Experiential Sequences, A Note on Reading.

**Result:** Preface drops to ~2,200 words. Terminology moves adjacent to the glossary where readers will actually consult it.

---

Brief response: **CONFIRM** or **OBJECT** (with reason). One word is fine if you agree.
