*Propose standby reader profile — background, knowledge, disposition*

**Standby Reader Profile:** We've unanimously agreed to add a standby reader. Now each of you: propose a **reader profile** — what kind of person should this reader be?

Consider:
1. **Background** — what level of education/reading experience? Philosophy background or not? Math background or not?
2. **What they should NOT know** — what must they be naive about for the test to work?
3. **What they SHOULD know** — minimum literacy/knowledge to engage meaningfully?
4. **Reading instructions** — how should they be told to read? What should they report on?
5. **Personality/disposition** — patient? curious? skeptical? literary-minded?

Submit your proposal to **team-lead**. After collecting all proposals, we'll synthesize.

Let me think carefully about what kind of reader would best serve as a test subject for this collection, specifically from the standpoint of what the existentialist and absurdist dimensions of the text need.

Proposal submitted. The key points of my recommendation:

**Background**: Graduate-level reading sophistication in humanities, but not a philosophy specialist. Could be from literature, history, science writing, or a scientifically trained person who reads broadly.

**Must be naive about**: Camus (beyond the name), category theory, Chinese philosophy, and -- critically -- the fact that the collection is designed to produce specific experiences. Telling them about "experiential sequences" would contaminate the experiment.

**Must have**: Comfort with demanding prose, familiarity with existential themes through lived experience (not academic study), intellectual self-confidence to report honestly when something fails.

**Reading instructions**: Sequential order only, with no explanation of why. After each essay, report on what stayed with them, where they got lost, where they felt something shift, and what felt unnecessary. After the whole collection: does Part 2 change how they think about Part 1?

**Disposition**: Curious rather than skeptical (premature skepticism defeats the experiential sequences), patient but honest, able to articulate felt experience and not just propositional content, and absolutely not a people-pleaser.

**Summary image**: An *LRB*/*NYRB* reader -- broadly educated, accustomed to demanding prose, approaching this material fresh.
