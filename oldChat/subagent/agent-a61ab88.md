*Confirming 诗意 resolution: *

The author endorses the current resolution for 诗意 (shiyi):

- **"the poetic"** as the standard substantive form
- **"poetic"** as adjective
- **"poeticality"** acceptable as an occasional variant noun
- **Capitalize "the Poetic"** in the translator's introduction and glossary to signal philosophical weight

Does everyone still agree with this resolution? Any second thoughts now that we've been through the full dictionary discussion? Concise yes/no + any brief additions.

  "content": "Yes, still agree with \"the poetic\" / \"the Poetic\" / \"poetic\" as adjective.\n\nOne reservation: \"poeticality\" is clunky. In English it sounds like a back-formation that draws attention to itself as a word rather than pointing through to the concept. If a noun form is occasionally needed beyond \"the poetic,\" I would prefer \"poetic stance\" or \"poetic mode\" over \"poeticality.\" But this is minor -- if the translator finds a sentence where \"poeticality\" is the only grammatically clean option, it is acceptable. Just not as a routine variant."
