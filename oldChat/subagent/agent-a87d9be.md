*形而上: *

Quick question from the author on 形而上 (xing er shang):

The current dictionary entry has the main translation as "the metaphysical" (substantive adjective). The author is asking: should it be "the metaphysical" or "metaphysical object"?

Consider: the author uses 形而上 to refer to constructions built upon phenomena (形/现象) that claim constancy/universality — all Second Reality content. The formal definition: "a metaphysical m is an association in E, and m is a universal property in some subcategory of E."

Which rendering is better and why? Is there a context where one works better than the other? Keep your response concise.

Sent my recommendation: "the metaphysical" for the domain/mass usage, "a metaphysical" for countable instances. The key argument against "metaphysical object" is that it imports exactly the ontological reification the author's framework dismantles -- 形而上 is a structural position (universal property in E), not a thing. The substantive adjective pattern follows precedent in English philosophy ("a universal," "a particular"). Standing by.
