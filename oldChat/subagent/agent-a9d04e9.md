*APPROVE all 8 revisions; withdrew essay-specific proposal; minor note on probe 5*

**APPROVE** the plan as a whole. Comments on individual revisions:

**Revision 1 (baseline expectation):** APPROVE. Good calibration tool.

**Revision 2 (defer Q4 to Part 2):** APPROVE. This is the right call — the Fish/Fishing distinction depends on the reader not knowing they're undergoing philosophical experiments. The phil-mind dissent is correctly handled: if Q2 doesn't surface experiential effects unprompted, that IS the data.

**Revision 3 (split engagement/pacing):** APPROVE.

**Revision 4 ("stayed with you / didn't land"):** APPROVE. Better framing for our purposes.

**Revision 5 (marginal notes):** APPROVE with the revised optional framing.

**Revision 6 (no essay-specific per-essay questions):** APPROVE. I note that my original submission proposed essay-specific follow-ups. I accept the unanimous counter-argument — the contamination risk across essays is real. The generic template during reading plus targeted probes after completion is the correct architecture. I withdraw my earlier proposal.

**Revision 7 (expanded Critical Experiential Checks):** APPROVE. The expansion from 3 to 8 probes covers the right essays. My earlier suggestion for an Essay 5 experiential check on the lucid dreamscape is captured by probe 5 ("What did you make of the dreamscape concept?"). One note: probe 5 could be slightly more open-ended — "dreamscape concept" names the specific concept, whereas "What stayed with you from Essay 5?" would let us see whether the dreamscape concept is even what the reader remembers most. But this is minor and I don't insist on it.

**Revision 8 (Essay 5→6 transition flag):** APPROVE. This is a genuine risk point in the reading experience and worth actively monitoring.

No objections to any revision. The plan is well-synthesized.

Your point on probe 5 is interesting and converges with phil-mind-expert's note from a different angle: phil-mind suggested shifting the wording from conceptual to experiential (\"What was your experience of the dreamscape idea?\"), and you're suggesting going even more open-ended (\"What stayed with you from Essay 5?\"). Both are worth considering when the document reaches me for editing. I'll track both suggestions. Waiting for team-lead to assign next steps.",

I'm receiving APPROVE votes from experts on what appears to be a reader-testing protocol plan with 8 revisions. I've acknowledged four experts so far (phenomenology, kantian, phil-mind, metaphysics). I'm tracking two convergent suggestions on probe 5 (Essay 5 dreamscape question) wording.

Waiting for team-lead to assign my next task. No action needed on my part until then.
