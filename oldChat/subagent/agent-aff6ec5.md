*Editorial review of Essay 4 draft complete*

Editorial review of your Essay 4 DaoDeRenYiLi draft is complete. Full review saved at:
`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Editor/Review-Essay4-DaoDeRenYiLi.md`

**Overall: Strong draft. Philosophically faithful, experiential sequence intact.**

Three priority flags to address:

1. **Line 38 pacing (R7):** The long sentence culminating the phenomenal reversal ("That is to say: because phenomenal ritual conduct (apparently) is exhibited...") is 47 words with 5 "phenomenal X" compounds. Suggest em dashes instead of parentheses for breathing room: "phenomenal ritual conduct — apparently — is exhibited..."

2. **Line 42 emphasis (R7):** The key claim about the self/other experience gap is buried in a 46-word subordinate clause ("even though **no** actual phenomenal rightness... only what **I** feel when **I** practice phenomenal ritual conduct"). Consider splitting at "because" into two sentences for emphasis.

3. **Line 44 formatting (B5):** "**what a person is**" should be "**what a *person* is**" — source has bold + italic on 人.

Three minor flags (your judgment):
- "run from first to last as from top to bottom" — slightly awkward phrasing
- "it is the phenomenal" — landing weight
- Footnote 3: "is said to be" vs. "means"

No changes needed on: block quote, all TNs, experiential sequence, "phenomenal X" consistency, closing paragraph. These are all strong.

Good, the Editor has reviewed my Essay 4 draft. Let me read the full review and then address each flag.

Excellent editorial review. Let me now address each flag and apply the revisions to the draft. Let me also check the source formatting for the 人 emphasis.

Good. I can confirm the source has **什么是*人*** — bold on the whole phrase with italic on 人 specifically. Now let me apply the revisions.

**My decisions on each flag:**

1. **Priority Flag 1 (line 38 pacing):** ACCEPT. Em dashes instead of parentheses for "(apparently)" and "(ought to)" — good prose-rhythm improvement, no content change.

2. **Priority Flag 2 (line 42 sentence split):** ACCEPT. Splitting the 46-word subordinate clause at "because" into two sentences strengthens the emphasis on the self/other gap — the most important philosophical claim in this paragraph.

3. **Priority Flag 3 (line 44 formatting):** ACCEPT. Source has **什么是*人*** — bold + italic. Must fix.

4. **Minor Flag 4 (line 36 phrasing):** ACCEPT. "proceed from first to last, that is, from top to bottom" is clearer.

5. **Minor Flag 5 (line 36 "it is the phenomenal"):** LEAVE. Adding "the form itself" risks B5. The phrase is slightly flat but accurate and consistent with "it is the metaphysical" in the paired clause.

6. **Minor Flag 6 (footnote 3 "is said to be"):** LEAVE. "Is said to be" correctly signals reported traditional definitions, not the author's own claims. This is the right register for this footnote.

Now applying the changes:
