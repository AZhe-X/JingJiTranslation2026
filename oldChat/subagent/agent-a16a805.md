The draft has incorporated all three of my revisions ("directed toward the other," "moves me to want to," "is exhibited"). TN2 now includes the note about trusting the author's own preceding paragraph. TN3 has been expanded to note the extension of 德 beyond persons. The phenomenal register is consistent throughout.

One minor thing I notice: footnote [^3] (line 54) still uses "impels" — "a feeling that impels me to act in certain ways" — which is the author's own footnote, not running text. Since this is the author's voice in a footnote explaining the phenomenal level, the same concern applies, but footnotes have more latitude. I'll flag it as minor.

**CONFIRM WITH NOTE** sent to team lead. The draft is approved. One minor consistency flag: footnote [^3] still uses "impels" where the body text was corrected to "moves" — not blocking, just worth harmonizing in a final polish pass.
