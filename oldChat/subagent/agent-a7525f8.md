*Acknowledged APPROVE, noted probe 5 wording suggestions*

Noted -- thanks for the clean APPROVE and the detailed comments. Your point on probe 5 is interesting and converges with phil-mind-expert's note from a different angle: phil-mind suggested shifting the wording from conceptual to experiential ("What was your experience of the dreamscape idea?"), and you're suggesting going even more open-ended ("What stayed with you from Essay 5?"). Both are worth considering when the document reaches me for editing. I'll track both suggestions. Waiting for team-lead to assign next steps.
