*Synthesize all feedback into unified plan now*

Editor — you've received all 10 submissions plus supplementary feedback. Now please synthesize everything into a single unified revision plan for the Reporting Protocol. Then broadcast that plan to all 10 team members for discussion. Back and forth until agreement.

Do NOT send feedback to "translator" — you ARE the orchestrator here. Your deliverable is a unified plan sent to all experts and translator-2 for review.

Right — I need to synthesize all the feedback I've received into a unified plan. Let me review what I have. The team lead says I've received all 10 submissions. Let me think about what feedback I've collected through this conversation, including from the experts who sent me messages and my own analysis. Let me also re-read the current Reporting Protocol to have it fresh.

Good. Now let me synthesize all the feedback I have — from all team members' submissions and my own analysis — into a unified revision plan. Let me work through this systematically.

Based on all the feedback I've received and my own analysis, here's the synthesis:

Unified revision plan broadcast to all 11 team members (9 experts + translator-2 + team lead). The plan covers 8 revisions:

1. **Add baseline-expectation question after Preface** — tests whether the Preface sets the right frame
2. **Defer "experience vs. argument" question to Part 2 only** — prevents priming during Fish section
3. **Split engagement/pacing into two questions** — separates momentum from difficulty
4. **"Stayed with you / didn't land" replaces "best/worst"** — experiential framing over evaluative
5. **Request marginal notes before per-essay questions** — captures uncontaminated in-reading observations
6. **NO essay-specific per-essay questions** — unanimous anti-priming consensus
7. **Expand Critical Experiential Checks from 3 to 8 probes** — covers all essays with non-leading probes delivered only after all reading is complete
8. **Internal flag: watch Essay 5 to 6 transition** — informational, not reader-facing

Now waiting for votes and amendments from all team members. I'll compile responses and iterate until we reach agreement.
