*Apply 3 Preface edits + update YAML to DRAFT-R3, confirm when done*

The user has given the go-ahead. Please apply the following three edits to the Translator's Preface at:
`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Draft/Translators-Preface.md`

---

**Edit 1 (Line 46):**

Find: `of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat`

Replace with: `of confronting the absurd through increasingly familiar examples`

---

**Edit 2 (Line 50):**

Find the entire paragraph starting with "Two structural claims of the collection deserve advance notice..." through "...inhabiting a Jing in which meaning is internally generated."

Replace with: `The three essays of Part 1 examine, respectively, collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity -- each through a distinctive philosophical method the author does not yet name. The four essays of Part 2 develop the formal framework behind that method: the concepts of the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and a categorical formalism for the structure of experience. The relationship between the two parts is itself part of the argument.`

---

**Edit 3 (Lines 95-96):**

Find the entire paragraph starting with "In Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder..." through "...without destroying it."

Replace with: `In Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order, progressing from the mythic to the mundane. The progression itself is the philosophical payload: by the final example, the reader is invited to test the essay's claim against their own experience. The recognition that follows -- which cannot be produced by argument alone -- is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it.`

---

**Also update the YAML header:**
- Change `status:` to `DRAFT-R3 (spoiler resolution per team consensus)`
- Update the `date:` to `2026-02-11`
- Update the `note:` to: `R3 resolves spoilers: structural claims paragraph (line 50) replaced with topic-only text; Essay 3 punchline and case listing removed from Experiential Sequences section; "dissolve in the presence of a cat" softened in Fish/Fishing section. Removed content moves to Translator's Afterword (to be drafted). 11/11 team consensus. Two registered non-blocking dissents noted (metaphysics-expert on Edit 4; translator-2 on Edit 3).`

Please confirm when all edits are applied.

First, the author treats nihilism not as the negation of metaphysics but as its *consequence*: when metaphysical systems claim to describe ultimate reality and then fail, the void they leave is nihilism. Post-metaphysics is the path that emerges after recognizing this -- not by rejecting metaphysical construction, but by practicing it lucidly. Second, the author treats absurdity not as a permanent human condition (as in Camus) but as a structural collapse: absurdity arises when one's Jing seeks meaning externally and finds none. The dissolution of absurdity
