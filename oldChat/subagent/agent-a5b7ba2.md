*Check 境界 occurrences in source texts — traditional or technical?*

Follow-up question from the author on 境界: Since 境界 also contains 境, we need to check whether the -scape link should apply here too, or whether 境界 is used in its traditional sense (boundary/realm/level of attainment).

Could you check where 境界 actually appears in the original essays and assess: is the author using 境界 in a way that connects to the technical concept 境, or in its traditional/conventional sense? Does the 境 inside 境界 matter the same way the 境 inside 梦境 matters?

The source texts are at:
/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录/
/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/22 随笔/

Please check the actual occurrences and give your assessment. Brief responses welcome.

Let me find and examine all occurrences of 境界 in the source texts.

[tool: Grep]
{
  "pattern": "境界",
  "path": "/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录",
  "output_mode": "content",
  "-C": 3
}

Let me read the omitted long lines to see the full context of each occurrence.

[tool: Read]
{
  "file_path": "/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录/范畴论与境 整理.md",
  "offset": 14,
  "limit": 15
}

[tool: Read]

Excellent. Now I have a clear picture. Let me also check if there are any other occurrences I might have missed in other essays.

[tool: Grep]
{
  "pattern": "境界",
  "path": "/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章",
  "output_mode": "content",
  "-n": true
}

Good -- 境界 only appears in Essay 6 (范畴论与境) and its compiled version (范畴论与境 整理), in the same passage. The occurrences are identical across both versions. Let me now send my assessment.

[tool: SendMessage]
{
  "type": "message",
  "recipient": "team-lead",
  "content": "Checked all source texts. 境界 appears only in Essay 6 (范畴论与境 / 范畴论与境 整理), in a single passage that uses it repeatedly. Here are the occurrences with analysis:\n\n**Occurrence 1** (line 17/18): \n> 正如我们在语言的*境界*（界限）内\n\n\"Within the *jingjie* (limits) of language\" -- the author **self-glosses 境界 as 界限 (limits/bounds)** in parentheses. This is the boundary/horizon sense.\n\n**Occurrence 2** (same line):\n> 因此在这一*境界*内，对*内在*本质的探索**就是**对其*外在*的延伸的明晰\n\n\"Within this *jingjie*\" -- referring back to \"the bounds of language.\" Same boundary sense.\n\n**Occurrence 3** (line 19/20):\n> 不可能提供*超出*其*境界*之外的任何信息\n\n\"Cannot provide any information *beyond* its *jingjie*\" -- again, boundary/limit of what thought can reach.\n\n**Occurrence 4
