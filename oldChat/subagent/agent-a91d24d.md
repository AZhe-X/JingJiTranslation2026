*AGREE with note on Wang Yangming framing for future drafting*

**AGREE.**

The final proposal is comprehensive and well-reasoned. I note with satisfaction that the Chinese philosophical tradition bullet in Section B now includes the commentarial tradition (Heshang Gong, Wang Bi) and Xunzi's 礼论, which were the amendments I proposed. The Preface edits are clean and the Afterword blueprint is structurally sound.

One small note for when the Afterword is eventually drafted (not an objection, just a flag for future reference): in Section B's Chinese philosophy bullet, the mention of Wang Yangming's 知行合一 should be handled with care. The author never explicitly invokes Wang Yangming, and the parallel — while real (unity of knowing and acting resonates with the author's practice-centered post-metaphysics) — should be presented as a convergence the reader might explore, not as an influence or direct engagement. The same applies to the Neo-Confucian 理/气 discussion. The Afterword's framing of "convergences, not influences" already handles this correctly in principle; I just want to ensure it is maintained in execution for the Chinese tradition specifically, where the temptation to read lineage will be strongest for specialist readers.

Good drafting note. Already recorded AGREE. Waiting for translator-2 to confirm the edits are applied.
