*Vote on Foreword — yes/no/optional, with reasons*

ALL TEAM MEMBERS (experts, translator-2, editor):

Vote: **Should this collection include a Foreword?**

Reminder: A Foreword is written by someone other than the author or translator — typically a scholar, philosopher, or expert who can position the work for the reader. The Translator's Preface (DRAFT-R2) is already done and confirmed.

The question is: in addition to the Translator's Preface, should there be a Foreword?

Options:
- **YES** — include a Foreword
- **NO** — Translator's Preface is sufficient
- **OPTIONAL** — nice to have but not necessary

Please vote AND give a brief reason (1-2 sentences). Everyone votes.

Voted OPTIONAL. The key reasoning: a Foreword adds value only if the right scholar can be found — someone who genuinely understands the cross-traditional nature of the work. The Translator's Preface already handles the essential contextualizing, so a Foreword is a quality-dependent addition rather than a structural necessity.
