*Second opinion on rendering 诗意 as *

I'm the translator for the 境集 collection. I need a second opinion on the rendering of 诗意 (shiyi).

The existentialism expert recommends **"the poetic"** (capitalized as substantive, lowercase as adjective). Key arguments: preserves the metaphorical extension from literary to existential; established precedent (Bachelard, Ricoeur); short and grammatically flexible; the "aesthetic" misreading self-corrects in context.

The rejected alternatives were:
- "poiesis" (Aristotelian instrumental-making baggage; too obscure)
- "poetic dwelling" (over-identifies with Heidegger; author is more agentic)
- "lucid engagement" etc. (loses the 诗 dimension)

From your phenomenological perspective, do you agree with "the poetic"? 

Specifically, I'm interested in:
1. Whether "the poetic" adequately captures the phenomenological dimension — the fact that 诗意 involves a specific mode of intentional engagement (lucid constitution of meaning-structures while inhabiting them). Does it risk collapsing 诗意 into Heidegger's Dichtung in the reader's mind?
2. Your analysis report connected 诗意 to the "transcendental attitude" (being reflectively aware within experience) but noted the author's version lacks Husserl's "spectatorial" quality. Does "the poetic" convey this non-spectatorial, fully-engaged-yet-aware quality?
3. Any alternative you'd prefer from the phenomenological tradition?

Sent my response to the translator. I endorse "the poetic" as the best available rendering of 诗意, with three specific points:

1. The Heideggerian gravitational pull is real but manageable -- the convergence is genuine, and the text itself will specify the divergences (more agentic, more ludic).
2. It captures the non-spectatorial double consciousness (immersed-yet-aware) better than alternatives, though it slightly underemphasizes the active construction dimension.
3. I rejected three phenomenological alternatives ("lucid engagement," "transcendental praxis," "poietic awareness") -- each captures one dimension but loses others.

I suggested a brief first-occurrence footnote to inoculate against the Heideggerian over-reading. Standing by.
