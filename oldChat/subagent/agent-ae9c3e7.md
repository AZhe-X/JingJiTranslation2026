*Debate *

The author wants to discuss chinese-phil-expert's proposal: "constitutive nature" for 德.

Chinese-phil-expert's argument was:
- "Constitutive" means "having the power to establish or compose" — neutral on whether innate or constructed
- "Nature" captures "what-it-is-ness" without moral baggage
- Has philosophical pedigree across Kant (constitutive vs. regulative), phenomenology (constitutive analysis), and philosophy of science
- Maps well to the author's constructivist usage: 德 is the constitutive principle that emerges from bottom-up assembly of phenomena

Those who voted differently: what is your specific objection to "constitutive nature"? And chinese-phil-expert: defend it against the main counterarguments (too heavy for running text? "nature" collides with 性?)

Brief responses please — focus on the strongest objection or defense.

The problem is that it is six syllables and two words in a passage where 德 appears densely and repeatedly.\n\nLook at the 道德仁义礼 passage. In a single paragraph the author moves through 德 multiple times in close succession -- \"人人皆而有之的东西...便是德,\" \"凡事诸物皆有其德,\" \"所有的德合起来...归纳抽象出道.\" In English this becomes: \"...this is the constitutive nature,\" \"everything has its constitutive nature,\" \"all constitutive natures together are abstracted into...\" The phrase accumulates weight wit
