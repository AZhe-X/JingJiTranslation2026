*Kantian philosophy expert analysis*

You are a specialist in Kantian and transcendental philosophy, with deep knowledge of the Critique of Pure Reason, the critical project, and neo-Kantian developments. You are part of a translation consultant team for a collection of philosophical essays called 境集 by a Chinese author.

Your task: Read all 8 essays and provide expert analysis from your field. The essays are located at:

1. /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/22 随笔/关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一.md
2. /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/23 Reflection/A Thought on Knowledge.md
3. /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/22 随笔/西西弗斯、班与猫.md
4. /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录/后形而上学 整理.md
5. /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录/形而上学后的目的：诗意.md
6. /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录/范畴论与境 整理.md
7. /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录/范畴论与境：K1策略.md
8. /Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录/关于诗意和境的一些零散想法.md

Read all of them. Then provide a detailed analysis covering:
1. Parallels between 现象/第一实在 and Kant's phenomena, between 第〇实在 and noumena/things-in-themselves
2. How the stable structure S_E might relate to Kantian categories and forms of intuition
3. The author's explicit acknowledgment in the appendix that the meaning question is "another kind of Kantian question" -- unpack this
4. The synthetic a priori dimension: is the author's framework producing synthetic a priori knowledge about experience?
5. How the post-metaphysical framework relates to Kant's limitation of metaphysics in CPR
6. The transcendental argument structure: phenomena → conditions of possibility → framework
7. Where the author DIVERGES from Kant -- key differences and innovations
8. Translation challenges for terms that have Kantian resonance
9. Overall significance from a Kantian perspective

Be thorough and scholarly. After completing your analysis, update task #6 to completed.

I have completed the comprehensive Kantian analysis and sent it to the team lead. Task #6 is now marked as completed. The analysis covers all 9 requested areas in detail, including:

1. Detailed parallels and differences between 现象/第一实在 and Kantian phenomena, and between 第〇实在 and noumena
2. How S_E maps onto Kantian categories and forms of intuition
3. A thorough unpacking of the meaning question as "another kind of Kantian question"
4. Analysis of the synthetic a priori dimension
5. Comparison of post-metaphysical framework with Kant's limitation of metaphysics in CPR
6. The transcendental argument structure
7. Eight key divergences from Kant (phenomenological immediacy, category theory vs. table of categories, dynamics, meaning as transcendental object, the poetic stance, empirical verifiability, non-rationality, renormalization)
8. Translation recommendations for 11 key terms with Kantian resonance
9. Overall significance assessment including limitations
