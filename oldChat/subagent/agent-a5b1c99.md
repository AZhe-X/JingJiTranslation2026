*Debate: intoxicated vs absorbed vs immersed for 沉醉*

The author wants a focused debate on the translation of 沉醉 / 沉醉的梦境:

Current split:
- **"intoxicated"** (metaphysics, existentialism, chinese-phil, buddhism) — preserves the Chinese metaphor (沉=sink, 醉=drunk), Buddhist resonance (mada, clouded awareness)
- **"absorbed"** (phenomenology) — more neutral, closer to Heidegger's Verfallen
- **"immersed"** (wittgenstein, phil-mind) — neutral, captures the "sunk-in" quality without pejorative connotation

The key tension: "intoxicated" is faithful to the source metaphor but carries negative connotations in English (implies impairment, poor judgment). "Absorbed" and "immersed" are neutral but lose the 醉 (drunk) component.

Please debate this among yourselves. Make your case, respond to the other positions, and see if you can reach consensus. Is the pejorative connotation of "intoxicated" a feature (the author IS describing a state of unknowing) or a bug (the author is not morally condemning pre-metaphysical existence)?

Let me think carefully about this from the Chinese philosophical tradition before making my case.

This is unambiguous. The character contains 酉 (wine vessel). There is no way to read 醉 as \"absorbed\" or \"immersed\" without erasing its semantic content.\n\nThe compound 沉醉 in standard Chinese usage means \"to be intoxicated with, to be besotted by, to be lost in (something pleasurable)

My case has been sent. To summarize the argument I made:

**"Intoxicated" is the right translation for 沉醉** because:

1. **Philologically faithful** -- 醉 literally means "drunk" (the character contains 酉, wine vessel). The author chose 沉醉 over neutral alternatives like 沉浸 (immersed) or 专注 (absorbed) deliberately.

2. **The pejorative connotation is a feature, not a bug** -- but a *mild* one. In both classical Chinese philosophy (Zhuangzi's dream) and Buddhism (*mada*/heedlessness), the state described is not morally condemned but is epistemically inferior: pleasurable unknowing, being drunk on the dream.

3. **"Absorbed" and "immersed" erase the source text** -- they translate what the author *could have written* (沉浸, 陷入) rather than what the author *did write* (沉醉).

4. **Compromise option: "entranced"** if the team finds "intoxicated" too strong -- it preserves altered consciousness and pleasurability without implying impairment.

Now waiting on the other experts' responses to see if consensus emerges.
