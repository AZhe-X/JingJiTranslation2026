*Vote on Afterword — yes/no/optional, with reasons*

ALL TEAM MEMBERS:

New question from the author: **Since we decided the work doesn't need an external introduction BEFORE the essays, should there be an Afterword AFTER the essays?**

For example, an editor's afterword, a translator's afterword, or a critical afterword that discusses the work's significance, connections to other traditions, etc. — placed AFTER the reader has completed the experiential sequences.

This would avoid the spoiler problem entirely (the reader has already experienced everything) while still providing the scholarly positioning, cross-traditional connections, and critical context that a Foreword would have provided.

Vote:
- **YES** — include an Afterword (say what kind)
- **NO** — not needed
- **OPTIONAL** — nice to have but not necessary

Brief reason (1-2 sentences).

It also gives us a natural home for the kind of critical analysis the expert reports con

Voted YES for a Translator's Afterword. This solves the spoiler problem elegantly — it's the structurally correct location for all the critical analysis, cross-traditional connections, and scholarly positioning that we couldn't put in the Preface without pre-revealing the experiential payoffs. The reader arrives already having had the experiences; the Afterword helps them understand what they've been through.
