*Approve plan with 3 amendments to Revision 7*

**Response to Unified Revision Plan (from existentialism-expert)**

---

**REVISION 1: Baseline-expectation question after Preface**
**APPROVE.**
Clean calibration question. If the reader says "I expect philosophical arguments about Chinese concepts," the Preface has under-communicated the experiential dimension. If they say "I expect to have experiences that get analyzed later," the Preface may be over-priming. Either answer is diagnostic. No contamination risk because it asks about expectations, not about specific content.

---

**REVISION 2: Defer Q4 to Part 2 only**
**APPROVE.**
This was the core of my original concern about line 31. Deferring to Part 2 is actually better than my suggestion (use once after Essay 1 as calibration), because even a single instance after Essay 1 plants the seed. The Fish must be eaten before the reader knows they are learning to fish. Phil-mind-expert's concern is valid in principle but the counter-argument is correct: absence of unprompted experiential reporting IS the data.

---

**REVISION 3: Split engagement/pacing question**
**APPROVE.**
Methodologically sound. A reader who wants to keep reading despite difficult passages and a reader who found everything smooth are in very different positions, and the combined question collapses them.

---

**REVISION 4: Refine "best/worst" wording**
**APPROVE.**
"Stayed with you / didn't fully land" is exactly right for this protocol. "Best and worst" invites ranking; "stayed with you" invites recall. Recall is experiential; ranking is evaluative. We want the former.

---

**REVISION 5: Request marginal notes**
**APPROVE.**
The revised optional framing ("If you made any marks...") resolves the only real concern. Pre-reflective notes are the most valuable data we can collect -- they show what the reader noticed before the reporting questions frame their attention. Even a note that says "???" next to a passage tells us something. The optional framing prevents non-note-takers from feeling inadequate.

---

**REVISION 6: NO essay-specific per-essay questions**
**APPROVE.**

I note that this overrides my own earlier proposal for essay-specific Stage 2 follow-ups. I accept the override. On reflection, the team's unanimous convergence is correct: even carefully non-leading follow-ups delivered after each essay will accumulate into a pattern the reader can detect. After Essay 1 we ask about the physics analogy; after Essay 2 we ask about the register shift; by Essay 3, the reader is anticipating "what will they ask about THIS one?" and reading with that meta-awareness. The architecture of generic-during, targeted-after-all is cleaner.

The essay-specific probes I proposed should migrate to the expanded Critical Experiential Checks (Revision 7), which is exactly where most of them ended up.

---

**REVISION 7: Expand Critical Experiential Checks to 8 probes**
**APPROVE WITH AMENDMENT.**

The expansion is right. Having probes for all essays plus the Appendix is essential now that we've decided against per-essay specifics. Three amendments:

**Amendment 7a: Essay 5 probe wording.**
Current: "What did you make of the dreamscape concept?"
This is fine but somewhat cerebral -- it invites conceptual summary rather than experiential report. Suggest revising to:
> "In Essay 5, the author distinguishes between two ways of being in a dreamscape. What was that distinction like for you?"

This is still non-leading (doesn't name "intoxicated" or "lucid") but orients toward felt experience rather than conceptual paraphrase. Whether the reader grasped the distinction as a felt difference between two modes of engagement (experiential) vs. a labeled dichotomy (propositional) is the critical diagnostic for Essay 5.

**Amendment 7b: Add Essay 5 follow-up probe.**
After the dreamscape probe, add:
> "When the essay argued that you cannot abandon all meaning -- did that feel like something you already knew, something you learned, or something you're not sure about?"

This tests the philosophical hinge of Essay 5 (feeling precedes self, therefore total nihilism is impossible as practice). It is non-leading because it offers three neutral options. The reader's answer tells us whether the argument worked as experiential recognition, intellectual proposition, or neither. This is Essay 5's most important move and should not be left untested.

**Amendment 7c: Appendix probe refinement.**
Current: "In the Appendix, the author discusses coin-flipping and lists many everyday activities. What was your experience of those passages?"
This is adequate but I want to flag an internal concern: the Appendix's near-lyrical climax ("We are poets of our own lives and experiences... Nothingness cannot stop us, because we and our hands already exist") is the emotional and philosophical culmination of the entire collection. The coin-flipping is an example; the everyday activities list builds toward this passage. If the probe names coin-flipping and everyday activities, the reader may report on those specifics without reaching the climax.

Suggest revising to:
> "In the Appendix, was there a passage or moment that felt like the collection was reaching some kind of conclusion or culmination?"

This tests whether the near-lyrical passage landed as a climax without naming it. If the reader quotes or paraphrases "poets of our own lives," we know the collection's emotional arc completed itself. If they cite something else or say nothing felt like a culmination, we know the Appendix's draft quality prevented it.

---

**REVISION 8: Internal flag for Essay 5→6 transition**
**APPROVE.**
This is exactly right. Having re-read both essays in sequence, the transition is jarring: Essay 5 ends with the luminous claim that "the only path left is to treat meaning as itself -- the lucid dreamscape -- the Poetic," and Essay 6 opens with "Why category theory?" and formal definitions. If the reader's momentum survives this, the translation apparatus is working. If it doesn't, we need a bridge (perhaps a brief translator's note at the head of Essay 6, or a more developed transition in the Translator's Preface).

I would add a second internal flag: **watch the Appendix transition.** Essay 7 ends with the ambitious "philosophical experiments" proposal and an invitation to re-read Essay 5. The Appendix opens with a reflection on the human condition that is gentler and more personal. This is a different kind of shift -- from formal ambition to intimate reflection -- and the reader's response will tell us whether the Appendix works as a denouement or as a letdown.

---

**OVERALL: APPROVE WITH THE THREE AMENDMENTS TO REVISION 7 AND THE ADDITIONAL INTERNAL FLAG IN REVISION 8.**
