*Save Afterword blueprint to your directory*

Please save the finalized Afterword blueprint to a file in your directory (`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Editor/`) for future reference. Include the full structure (Sections A-E + closing), word counts, all accepted amendments, and the process notes. Name it something like `Afterword-Blueprint.md`.
