*Review Reporting-Protocol, send feedback to editor*

Task: Review the Reporting-Protocol.md (in Standby Reader directory) and send your advice, suggestions, or confirmation to **editor**. 

The file is at: `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Standby Reader/Reporting-Protocol.md`

Read the file, then send your feedback directly to **editor** (not to me). Editor will orchestrate everyone's suggestions and discuss back and forth until a plan is agreed. Use your own judgment throughout.

One suggestion from the project lead to consider: **Should we add essay-specific questions alongside the general per-essay questions?** For example, after Essay 1 we might ask something tailored to what Essay 1 does, after Essay 2 something tailored to Essay 2, etc. — not just the same generic template for every essay. Think about whether this would be valuable, what those questions might look like, and whether they risk priming the reader (the same concern that led us to extract this file in the first place).

Send your feedback to **editor** when ready.

The staged delivery (general first, targeted after) and the non-leading language in the Critical Experiential Checks are exactly right. The \"What happened to your experience?\" framing is the correct way to probe without priming. No major structural changes needed.\n\n### On Essay-Specific Questions\n\n**My position: NO essay-specific questions alongside the general per-essay questions.** Here is my reasoning:\n\nThe general template (\"What was it about? Did something click? Did anything confuse you? Did it ask you to experience something?\") is already sufficient and — crucially — does not prime the reader for what is
