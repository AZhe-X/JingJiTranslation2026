*4 epistemology edits made, 1 TN suggestion declined with reasoning*

Thank you for the detailed review. Strong points on all the epistemological architecture -- glad the inference/explanation/application distinction, the property-to-definition reversal, and the generation chain all came through clearly. Here are the edits I made:

1. **"summarized from" → "derived from"** (concern 2) -- agreed, 总结 is an epistemic extraction operation, not condensation. "Derived from" is clean.

2. **"inductively generalized" → "inductively derived property"** (concern 4) -- agreed, avoids the tautological doubling.

3. **"issues in" → "one practices"** (concern 5) -- fixed in both occurrences (line 42 and line 46). 行 is active/agentive and "issues in" was too passive.

4. **Standardized "arising from the heart"** (concern 7) -- all three occurrences of 发乎于心 now consistently use "the heart" rather than mixing "from within me" and "from within the heart."

**Not adopted:** The TN3 addition ("a status arrived at through induction rather than given a priori"). The existing phrasing "assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down" already captures the epistemic operation in the author's own idiom. Adding "a priori" would import Kantian terminology that could mislead -- the author's framework is not specifically anti-Kantian here, just constructivist.

**On concern 8 (生成 consistency):** Confirmed -- "generate/generated" is used consistently throughout. I will not vary it for style.

You're right that \"a priori\" would import Kantian framing where none is warranted — \"assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down\" already does the work in the author's own terms. Better to stay within the text's own conceptual vocabulary.\n\nAll four edits look sound. Nothing further from my end.",

Confirmed all four edits with translator-2 and conceded the TN3 decline was well-reasoned. Review complete — waiting for further instructions from the team lead.
