*梦境 contains 境 — should translation preserve this link?*

Question from the author: 梦境 contains the character 境 — the same 境 as in the title 境集 and the central concept 境 (Jing). But "dreamscape" (and most proposed translations) doesn't capture this connection. The reader of the English text would not see that 梦境 literally contains 境.

Does this matter? Should the translation of 梦境 somehow preserve the 境 connection? If so, how?

Brief responses welcome. This is a real translation problem.

Response sent. My position: the 梦境/境 connection is philosophically load-bearing (it is the hinge where the metaphorical concept becomes the technical concept), and the translation must signal it. Two options offered:

1. **"dream-Scape"** with capital S -- explicit but slightly artificial
2. **"dreamscape"** with a translator's note establishing "-scape" as the English echo of 境 -- more natural prose, relies on the attentive reader

I recommended option 2, drawing on the precedent of how Buddhist translators handle 空 across its many compounds. Standing by.
