*Update reports re: intersubjectivity and philosophical experiments*

Follow-up: Based on the discussion we just had about intersubjectivity via η and the essays as philosophical experiments, please review your Analysis Report in your workspace directory:

/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/[Your Field]/Analysis Report.md

If your report mentions intersubjectivity or philosophical experiments, please update those sections to reflect the deeper understanding we've now reached. Specifically:

1. If you mentioned intersubjectivity — update to reflect the η-based structural commensurability account.
2. If you mentioned philosophical experiments — update to identify specific passages that function as experiments on the reader, and note the translation implication (experiential sequence is load-bearing, not merely illustrative).

If your report does NOT mention either topic, you may add a brief section if you think it's warranted, or skip this update if it's not relevant to your field.

Read your report first, then edit only the relevant sections. Do not rewrite the whole report.

Let me read my current report first, then update the relevant sections.

Good. My report mentions both intersubjectivity (Section 7B, point 1) and philosophical experiments (Section 5.3). Both need updating. Let me edit them.

Report updated. Two targeted edits:

1. **Section 5** -- Added detailed subsection on essays-as-experiments, identifying six specific passages with their experimental structures and the critical translation implication that experiential sequences are load-bearing.

2. **Section 7B.1** -- Revised intersubjectivity from "open limitation" to "substantially resolved via eta," with the remaining tension narrowed to the bootstrapping problem of shared formal media.

Standing by.
