*Confirming feedback already sent in two messages*

I have already sent my feedback in two messages to you:

1. **First message**: General assessment with 5 recommendations (reduce per-essay template to 3 questions, remove length constraint, soften math question, add essay-specific follow-ups as second pass, add administration notes).

2. **Second message**: Supplementary feedback after re-reading all 8+1 source essays -- revised and grounded essay-specific follow-up questions with detailed reasoning, plus a Part Transition question proposal after Essay 3, and a flag about the "three examples" wording in the Essay 3 Critical Check (should be "the examples" since there are actually four stages).

Let me know if you need anything clarified or expanded.
