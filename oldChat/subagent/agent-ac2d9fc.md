*APPROVE all 8 revisions, no amendments needed*

**APPROVE** the plan as a whole.

Brief notes on individual revisions:

**Revision 1 (baseline expectation):** APPROVE. "What kind of reading experience are you expecting?" is better than my earlier suggestion ("Is there anything from the Preface that you're now anticipating or looking for?") — it is more open-ended and less likely to prime the reader to search for specific things.

**Revision 2 (defer Q4):** APPROVE. The anti-priming logic is decisive. Phil-mind's concern is valid in principle but the counter-argument is correct: if experiential effects don't surface unprompted via Q2, that is itself the most important data point.

**Revision 3 (split Q5):** APPROVE. Double-barreled questions conflate distinct variables. Clean separation.

**Revision 4 (stayed with you / didn't land):** APPROVE. "Didn't fully land" keeps the reader in experiential mode and avoids implying a right answer.

**Revision 5 (marginal notes):** APPROVE. The revised "If you made any..." framing correctly handles non-note-takers. Pre-reflective data is more valuable than post-hoc reconstruction.

**Revision 6 (no essay-specific per-essay questions):** APPROVE. I had originally proposed essay-specific checks but explicitly recommended they go at the end, not per-essay. The unanimous decision to reject per-essay specifics is correct. My proposed checks for Essays 1, 2, 5, and 6 are effectively captured in Revision 7's expanded Critical Experiential Checks.

**Revision 7 (expanded checks):** APPROVE. One note: the Essay 2 probe ("did you notice a difference?") tests the bilingual register shift rather than the epistemological content. This is fine — the per-essay generic questions will have already captured the JTB-collapse experience if it occurred. The register-shift probe adds a distinct data point. I note that my proposed Bob-specific probe ("What stood out to you about the three scenarios involving Bob?") was not included, which is acceptable — if the Bob scenarios produced a strong effect, it will appear in the per-essay "clicked or shifted" response for Essay 2. Adding it as a ninth probe at the end would risk over-questioning.

**Revision 8 (Essay 5-6 transition flag):** APPROVE. Correctly identified as a risk point. The internal-note format is appropriate.

No amendments needed. Clean synthesis.
