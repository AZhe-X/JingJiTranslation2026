*Editor's Preface length assessment — vote on Option B*

ALL EXPERTS (not translator-2, not editor):

The editor has assessed the Translator's Preface length and offers the following recommendation. Please read and share your thoughts with me.

---

**Editor's assessment:** The Preface is slightly long at ~2,500 words, but within normal range (standard is 1,500-3,000 for philosophically complex translations).

**Editor's recommendation — Option B (strongest move):** Move the entire Key Terminological Decisions section (~800 words) out of the Preface and into a glossary introduction. This would:
- Cut the Preface to ~1,700 words
- Create a clean narrative arc: title → author → structure → bilingual nature → 形 reinterpretation → experiential sequences → reading advice
- Put terminology discussion where readers will actually consult it — adjacent to the glossary itself
- Make the Preface something a reader actually reads cover-to-cover before Essay 1

**Two smaller trims also suggested:**
1. Cut the working-draft quality paragraph from the Author section (~80 words) — redundant with Fish/Fishing section and Reading Note.
2. Simplify the Bilingual Collection forward references (~40 words) — "digestion," "knowledge sub-category" are forward references that confuse first-time readers. Replace with: "Three translator's footnotes within the essay connect its key terms to the formal apparatus of Part 2."

**What stays (non-negotiable per editor):**
- On the Title
- Fish and Fishing
- The Reinterpretation of 形
- Experiential Sequences
- A Note on Reading

Do you agree with the editor's Option B (move terminology to glossary intro)? Or should terminology stay in the Preface? Brief response — agree/disagree + one-sentence reason.

Sent my response. I agree with the editor's Option B (move terminology section to glossary introduction) and both smaller trims, with one reservation: "The Poetic" and "The Non-Rational" should retain a brief bridging paragraph in the Preface since they are conceptual orientations that shape how the reader approaches the entire collection, not just terminological entries. Everything else in the terminology section can move to the glossary introduction without loss.

Waiting for further instructions from the team lead.
