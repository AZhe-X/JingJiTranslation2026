*Context check ping*

Context integrity check — please confirm: do you have all 8+1 essays and your own Analysis Report (/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Epistemology/Analysis Report.md) loaded? If anything is missing, reload it now and report back.

The team lead is now addressing me directly, and the routing confirms my system agent ID is "epistemology-expert." Let me check whether I actually have the essays and the Epistemology Analysis Report loaded in my context. I have Essay 8 (关于诗意和境的一些零散想法) from the system reminders, and the Essay 4 draft translation. But I don't have the other essays or the Epistemology Analysis Report directly loaded. Let me read what I need.
