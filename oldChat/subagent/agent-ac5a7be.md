*Debate *

The author wants to discuss chinese-phil-expert's proposal: "constitutive nature" for 德.

Chinese-phil-expert's argument was:
- "Constitutive" means "having the power to establish or compose" — neutral on whether innate or constructed
- "Nature" captures "what-it-is-ness" without moral baggage
- Has philosophical pedigree across Kant (constitutive vs. regulative), phenomenology (constitutive analysis), and philosophy of science
- Maps well to the author's constructivist usage: 德 is the constitutive principle that emerges from bottom-up assembly of phenomena

Those who voted differently: what is your specific objection to "constitutive nature"? And chinese-phil-expert: defend it against the main counterarguments (too heavy for running text? "nature" collides with 性?)

Brief responses please — focus on the strongest objection or defense.

In Kant, the constitutive/regulative distinction (A509/B537) is between principles that *make* experience what it is versus principles that merely *guide* inquiry. The author's 德 is constitutive in precisely this Kantian sense: it is what *makes* a thing the kind of thing it is, not merely a description of it.\n\nMy earlier preference for \"defining character\" still works, but \"constitutive nature\

Switched my vote to "constitutive nature" -- the Kantian constitutive/regulative distinction (A509/B537) maps precisely onto the author's usage of 德, and "constitutive" signals philosophical weight that "defining" does not. Standing by.
