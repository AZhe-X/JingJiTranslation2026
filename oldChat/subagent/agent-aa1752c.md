The author is reviewing your draft of Essay4-DaoDeRenYiLi.md and has a question about this sentence:

"Phenomenal ritual conduct exists not only in how I treat others, but equally in how other people treat one another."

The author asks: do we want "equally" here? Please check against the original Chinese text for this sentence and advise whether "equally" is warranted or if a different word (or no adverb) would be more faithful.
