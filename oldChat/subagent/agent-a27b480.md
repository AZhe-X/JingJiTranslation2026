*Confirm: add Afterword + move spoilers from Preface*

ALL TEAM MEMBERS:

Confirm the following two decisions:

1. **Add a Translator's Afterword** — placed after all essays and the Appendix, before the Glossary. It will cover cross-traditional connections, translation choices, and scholarly positioning — all the things that would be spoilers in front matter.

2. **Move the spoiler content from the Preface to the Afterword** — specifically the structural claims paragraph (line 50: nihilism-as-consequence, absurdity dissolution + mechanism) and soften the Essay 3 punchline in the Experiential Sequences section. The Preface names topics without revealing conclusions; the Afterword discusses them freely.

Vote: **AGREE** or **DISAGREE** (with reason).

Moving the spoiler content to a Translator's Afterword solves the tension I identified — the Preface can describe the method (experiential sequences as philosophical experiments) without narrating the payoffs, and the Afterword can discuss them freely since the reader has already had the experiences. The placement before the Glossary is right: the Afterword provides interpretive context, and the Glossary provides terminological reference — natural reading order for a reader who has just finished the essays.",
