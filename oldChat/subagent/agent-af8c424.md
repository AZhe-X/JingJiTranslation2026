*Skip dictionary for now, focus on texts and reports*

Quick note from team lead: Don't worry about the Translation Dictionary for now. We will discuss it later entry by entry as a separate step. Focus your reading and questions on the source texts and expert reports — the philosophical content, translation challenges, register, performative structure, etc. Skip reading the master Translation Dictionary and the individual expert dictionaries for now.
