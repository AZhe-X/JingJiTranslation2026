*Read your own Analysis Report, not Memo*

You loaded the translator's Memo.md, which is NOT your analysis report. Your analysis report is at:

/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Chinese Philosophy/Analysis Report.md

Please read THIS file now. This is YOUR analysis report. You should NOT be reading the translator's files.

Confirm when done: "CONFIRM: Chinese Philosophy Analysis Report loaded"
