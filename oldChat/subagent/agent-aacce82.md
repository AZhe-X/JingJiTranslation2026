*Quick vote: 虚无 context-dependent or fixed default?*

**QUICK VOTE: 虚无 (xūwú) — Disagreement #7**

The current recommendation is: use **"nothingness"** or **"the void"** depending on context, with both acceptable. Key rule: NEVER use "emptiness" (reserved for Buddhist 空/sunyata).

Do you agree with this context-dependent approach (both acceptable, translator chooses based on passage), or do you want ONE fixed default?

Reply to team-lead: **CONFIRM** (context-dependent, both acceptable) or **OBJECTION** (with your preferred single default and reasoning).

The translator can judge by context. The hard rule — never \"emptiness\" — is the important constraint, and that is in place.",
