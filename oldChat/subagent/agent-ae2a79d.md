  "content": "The work is structurally self-introducing: Part 1 (Fish) is designed to produce philosophical experiences in the reader before Part 2 (Fishing) names and formalizes them. This is not accidental — it is the author's central methodological commitment that understanding comes through experience, not through external framing. An outside scholar explaining what the reader is about to experience would undermine the very mechanism by which the collection operates.",
  "summary": "Reason: work is self-introducing by design, external framing undermines method"
