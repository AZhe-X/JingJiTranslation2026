*Phil-mind review resend: 4 changes recommended*

Philosophy of Mind review of the Essay 4 道德仁义礼 draft translation. I've read the original Chinese (lines 18-30, footnotes 3, 4, 24) against your draft carefully. Overall this is strong work. Below are my comments, organized by area of expertise.

---

**1. FIRST-PERSON / THIRD-PERSON ASYMMETRY (the core philosophy-of-mind issue)**

This passage is essentially a problem-of-other-minds argument. The author's central move is: I feel X when I act, I see others acting similarly, I project X onto them. The draft handles this well in the long analytical paragraph (line 42), especially:

- "I cannot truly feel **another person's** inner feelings; I have merely **applied** my explanation of '**my own** phenomenal ritual conduct' to the phenomenal ritual conduct we observe **others** performing."

This is excellent — it preserves the first-person/third-person asymmetry clearly.

However, I have one concern. The Chinese at 我对人时发乎于心的对他人感受 (line 24 of original) is rendered as "the feeling that arises from within me when I face another person — a feeling of concern for the other" (line 38 of draft). The addition of "a feeling of concern for the other" is an interpolation. The Chinese says 对他人感受 — a feeling directed toward the other person. This could be concern, but it could also be any interpersonal feeling. The author is deliberately leaving the content of the feeling unspecified because the POINT is the structural relationship (feeling → motivation → action), not the specific emotional content. I'd suggest: "the feeling that arises from within me toward the other person" — no specification of "concern." Let the author's deliberate vagueness stand.

**2. 感受 (FEELING) AND 推动力 (DRIVING FORCE / MOTIVATION)**

The draft correctly renders 感受 as "feeling" throughout, consistent with the dictionary. Good.

The rendering of 推动力 as "driving force (*motivation*)" (line 38) works well — it preserves both the Chinese term's literal sense (推动 = push/drive + 力 = force) and the author's own parenthetical English gloss (*motivation*).

In the original footnote [^3], the author writes "这种推动力，这种'motivation'本身" — the author uses the English word "motivation" in the Chinese text. Your translation of footnote 3 renders this as "This driving force, this 'motivation' itself" — this is correct and preserves the bilingual play.

**3. THE "ACTUALLY" / 切实 PATTERN**

The author uses 切实 repeatedly and deliberately — it marks the boundary between phenomenal (actually felt) and inferred/projected. The draft renders this as "actual" / "actually" with bold emphasis, which correctly mirrors the original's emphasis pattern. This is crucial for the philosophy-of-mind argument: what is 切实 is within my phenomena; what is not 切实 is projected onto others. The draft handles this consistently. No changes needed.

**4. SUBTLE ISSUE: 发乎于心 (ARISES FROM WITHIN THE HEART)**

This phrase appears twice: once in the main text (line 24) and once at the end of the passage (line 28, "发乎于心的而有的现象礼"). The draft renders the first instance implicitly ("arises from within me") and the second as "arose from within the heart" (line 46).

I'd recommend consistency: use "from within the heart" or "from within" in BOTH instances. The Chinese 心 (heart/mind) is doing work here — it marks the interiority, the first-person phenomenal space. The first instance currently drops 心 entirely ("within me" instead of "within my heart"). Either keep 心 both times or drop it both times. Given that the philosophy-of-mind point is about the asymmetry between inner experience and outer observation, I'd lean toward keeping it: "the feeling that arises from within my heart toward the other person." The "heart" anchors the interiority.

**5. THE PROJECTION / 套用 MOVE**

Chinese: 将我对"自己的'现象礼'"的解释套用到了我们看到的别人所行的"现象礼"上 (line 26).

Draft: "I have merely **applied** my explanation of 'my own phenomenal ritual conduct' to the phenomenal ritual conduct we observe others performing."

套用 is stronger than "applied" — it means to mechanically apply a template, to impose a pattern. In philosophy of mind this is close to "analogical projection" or "simulation" (as in simulation theory of mind-reading). "Applied" is too neutral. Consider: "**imposed** my explanation" or "**mapped** my explanation onto" or "**projected** my explanation onto." Any of these would better capture the 套 (template/pattern) element of 套用.

**6. PROPERTY → DEFINITION REVERSAL**

The passage from 属性 (property) to 定义 (definition) (line 26 of original, line 44 of draft) is rendered cleanly. This is a crucial philosophical move — the transition from inductive observation to normative imposition. The draft's "a **property** that a person can have — here, humaneness — is transformed into a **definition** of personhood" captures this perfectly. TN4 reinforces it well.

**7. FOOTNOTE [^3] — MOTIVATION AS BRIDGE**

The footnote translation is accurate and clear. The Chinese says 仁 是谓爱人 ("humaneness is said to be loving others") and 义 是谓应当 ("rightness is said to be what one ought to do"). The draft renders these as "Humaneness (仁) is said to be *loving others*; rightness (义) is said to be *what one ought to do*." This correctly preserves the author's distancing ("is said to be" — this is the conventional understanding, not the author's own position). Good.

**8. FOOTNOTE [^4] — PHENOMENAL BOUNDARY**

The original: 这种推而广之的别人身上的"现象仁"和"现象义"已经不在我的现象之中了。

Draft: "The phenomenal humaneness and phenomenal rightness thus extended to others are no longer within *my* phenomena."

This is the crux of the other-minds problem, rendered in one devastating sentence. The translation is precise. The italicized "my" correctly marks the first-person possessive. No changes needed.

**9. MINOR: "rightness" vs "righteousness" in the block quote**

I understand the team debated this. From my earlier analysis, I recommended "righteousness" in the block quote for performative-experimental reasons (the reader needs semantic weight to feel the cascade of loss) and "rightness" in the commentary for analytical precision. The current draft uses "rightness" throughout. If the team has settled on this, I defer — but flag that the block quote's philosophical experiment is somewhat weakened by the lighter term.

---

**SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDED CHANGES (priority order):**

1. **Remove "a feeling of concern for the other"** — replace with "the feeling that arises from within my heart toward the other person." Don't specify the content of the feeling; preserve the author's deliberate generality.

2. **套用 → "projected" or "imposed"** instead of "applied" — captures the template-imposition structure critical to the other-minds argument.

3. **Consistency on 发乎于心** — use "from within the heart" in both instances, or neither. I recommend keeping it both times to anchor the first-person interiority.

4. **Consider "righteousness" in the block quote only** — the rest of the passage should keep "rightness."

Everything else reads accurately and philosophically well. The footnotes are precise, TN3 on the 德 shift is well-handled, and the overall structure of the argument comes through clearly in English.
