*经验 and 体验 both *

Follow-up on the 经验 vote. The author (team lead) raises a concern:

If we set 经验 → "experience" as main, then both 经验 AND 体验 have "experience" as their main translation. The full mapping would be:

- 感受 → "feeling" / "felt experience"
- 体验 → "experience"
- 经验 → "experience"
- 感觉 → "sensation"

Two different Chinese terms with the same English main translation. Is this acceptable, or does it create a problem?

If you think it's fine, explain why. If you think it's a problem, what's your solution — should one of them change?

Response sent. I demonstrated the collision problem with a concrete example from K1策略 line 205, where 体验 and 经验 appear in the same sentence doing different philosophical work. If both map to "experience," the distinction evaporates. The solution remains: 体验 → "experience," 经验 → "empirical experience" as the dictionary default, with flexibility to shorten in unambiguous solo contexts.
