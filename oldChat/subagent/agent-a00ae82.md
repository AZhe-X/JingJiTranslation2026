*Propose standby reader profile — background, knowledge, disposition*

**Standby Reader Profile:** We've unanimously agreed to add a standby reader. Now each of you: propose a **reader profile** — what kind of person should this reader be?

Consider:
1. **Background** — what level of education/reading experience? Philosophy background or not? Math background or not?
2. **What they should NOT know** — what must they be naive about for the test to work?
3. **What they SHOULD know** — minimum literacy/knowledge to engage meaningfully?
4. **Reading instructions** — how should they be told to read? What should they report on?
5. **Personality/disposition** — patient? curious? skeptical? literary-minded?

Submit your proposal to **team-lead**. After collecting all proposals, we'll synthesize.
