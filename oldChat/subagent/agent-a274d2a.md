*Translation pipeline set up; editor's review queue outlined*

Here is the translation and editorial pipeline I've set up:

**Immediate:**
- Translator-2 has been assigned to revise the Essay 4 Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li passage per your 6 editorial flags (Task #29). Please expect a revised draft soon.

**Next:**
- Essay 3 (Sisyphus, Work, and Cats) — full draft (Task #30). This is the highest-priority new essay for standby reader testing.
- Essay 1 (Collective Interest) — full draft (Task #31).

**Your editorial queue will be:**
1. Review revised Essay 4 passage when it arrives
2. Editorial review of Essay 3 draft when complete
3. Editorial review of Essay 1 draft when complete

The overall sequence: Essay 4 revision -> Essay 3 -> Essay 1 -> complete remaining Essay 4 -> Essay 5 -> Essays 6-7 -> Essay 2 apparatus -> Essay 8.

With the Reporting Protocol, Afterword Blueprint, Preface R3, and Glossary Introduction R2 all finalized or stable, the project now shifts fully to translation and editorial review. The standby reader can be deployed once we have the Preface + Essays 1-3 drafted and reviewed — that gives us the complete Part 1 (Fish) to test.
