*Update reports re: intersubjectivity and philosophical experiments*

Follow-up: Based on the discussion we just had about intersubjectivity via η and the essays as philosophical experiments, please review your Analysis Report in your workspace directory:

/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/[Your Field]/Analysis Report.md

If your report mentions intersubjectivity or philosophical experiments, please update those sections to reflect the deeper understanding we've now reached. Specifically:

1. If you mentioned intersubjectivity — update to reflect the η-based structural commensurability account.
2. If you mentioned philosophical experiments — update to identify specific passages that function as experiments on the reader, and note the translation implication (experiential sequence is load-bearing, not merely illustrative).

If your report does NOT mention either topic, you may add a brief section if you think it's warranted, or skip this update if it's not relevant to your field.

Read your report first, then edit only the relevant sections. Do not rewrite the whole report.

Let me read my current report first.

Good. My report does touch on intersubjectivity (in Section 2, point 2, where I discuss the projection of 现象仁 onto others) and it mentions philosophical experiments in passing (Section 9, qualification 4). Both warrant updates. I also need to add new sections on these two topics. Let me make the targeted edits.

First, I'll update the reversal argument section to add a note about how the eta framework resolves the intersubjectivity problem raised by the projection step:

  "replace_all": false,

Now update the qualification about philosophical experiments in Section 9:

Now add the two new sections at the end (before the final verdict, or rather after the current final paragraph). Let me append them after Section 9:

  "replace_all": false,

All three edits are in place and look correct. Let me notify the team lead.

Report updated. The three targeted edits are:

1. **Section 2, point 2** -- cross-reference added to new Section 10 on intersubjectivity
2. **Section 9, qualification 4** -- updated to acknowledge philosophical experiments are not merely programmatic, with cross-reference to new Section 11
3. **New Section 10** -- intersubjectivity via eta, compared against four traditional Chinese philosophical answers
4. **New Section 11** -- essays as philosophical experiments, with Chinese philosophical precedent (Mencius, Zhuangzi) and specific passage-by-passage analysis, plus the critical translation implication that experiential sequence is load-bearing
