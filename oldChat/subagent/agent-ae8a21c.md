*Glossary Introduction editorial flags — 1 priority, 3 minor*

**Editorial review of Glossary-Introduction.md — flags for your attention**

I have reviewed the Glossary Introduction draft. Overall assessment: strong, philosophically precise, consistent with all other documents. Four flags:

**1. Priority — coin-flip example (lines 39-40, "The Poetic" section):**
The full coin-flip explanation may spoil the Appendix for readers who consult the Glossary Introduction mid-reading (e.g., to look up a term). The reading order places this after the Appendix, so if readers follow prescribed order it is fine. But I recommend shortening to a brief mention without explaining the mechanism, for safety. Something like: "The author's coin-flipping example in the Appendix illustrates the Poetic in miniature: constructing a temporary meaning-structure, entering it lucidly, and arriving at genuine self-knowledge through the engagement." This preserves the gloss without walking through the mechanism step-by-step. Your judgment.

**2. Minor — line 24, "raw":**
"the raw, pre-theoretical ground" — "raw" is slightly informal for the scholarly register of this section. Consider dropping it ("the pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs"). Your call.

**3. Minor — line 60, "Readers should watch for the moment":**
This sentence mildly primes the Essay 4 reversal for readers consulting the Glossary Introduction during their reading. I lean toward keeping it (the risk is low and the sentence is editorially excellent), but flagging for your awareness.

**4. Minor — lines 82-84, "Other Terms":**
This section packs 7+ terms into a single dense paragraph. Consider formatting as a bulleted list for readability. Purely presentational.

**Cross-document consistency:** All terms match the Translation Dictionary, Preface, and Essay 4 draft. No discrepancies found. The 德 split, phenomenal-X apparatus, Heidegger comparison, Diamond Sutra caveat, and 虚妄 disambiguation are all well-handled.

The team lead told me to stand by and go idle. I should not be taking action on new tasks. But since this is editorial feedback on a document I'm responsible for, let me at least think through my responses so I'm ready when cleared to act.

**Flag 1 (coin-flip spoiler):** The editor is right to flag this. The Glossary Introduction sits after the Appendix in the prescribed reading order, so sequential readers are fine. But readers who flip to the glossary mid-reading (which is what glossaries are for) would encounter the full mechanism before reading the Appendix. The editor's shortened version preserves the gloss without the step-by-step walkthrough. I agree — shorten it.

**Flag 2 ("raw"):** I'd keep "raw" — it does work the register needs. "Pre-theoretical ground" alone is slightly too clinical. But this is genuinely minor either way.

**Flag 3 ("Readers should watch for the moment"):** Low risk, keep it. The sentence doesn't say what the moment is, just that there is one.

**Flag 4 (Other Terms formatting):** Bulleted list would be better for readability. Agree.

I'll hold these decisions until the team lead clears me to act.

Readers who consult the Glossary Introduction mid-reading shouldn't encounter the full mechanism before the Appendix.\n\n**Flag 2 (\"raw\"):** I'd keep it. \"Raw, pre-theoretical ground\" has a directness that matches the author's own register when discussing phenomena — phenomena are the unprocessed starting point, and \"raw\" conveys that. \"Pre-theoretical ground\" alone is slightly too polished for what it's describing. But I won't fight this if you feel strongly.\n\n**Flag 3 (\"
