*Debate *

The author is considering "character" for 德. Those who voted against it — what is your single strongest objection to "character"? Those who voted for it — what is its single strongest advantage?

Also: we now know 性 does NOT appear as a standalone technical term in the collection, so the "nature" collision concern is off the table.

Brief responses — one strongest point each.

Strongest objection to "character": it is philosophically flat.

"Character" gives the reader less to work with, though I would not strongly object if the team converges on it. Standing by.
