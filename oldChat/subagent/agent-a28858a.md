*Vote: poet vs Dichter finding — Preface, Afterword, or not included?*

**New finding from existentialism-expert:** The author's concept of the **poet (诗人)** vs Heidegger's **Dichter** — a significant difference not previously covered.

The author says in the Appendix: "我们正是这样的创造者，是自己生命和感受的诗人" — "We are precisely such creators, poets of our own lives and experiences."

**5 key differences from Heidegger's Dichter:**

1. **Universal vs singular** — "我们" (we), everyone is a poet; not a rare chosen figure like Holderlin
2. **Creator vs receiver** — paired with 创造者; the poet *makes*, not receives Being's disclosure
3. **Self-directed vs community-founding** — "自己生命和感受的诗人"; not founding dwelling for a historical people
4. **Medium-indifferent vs language-bound** — any medium works (desk arrangement, photography, cooking, memes); language has no priority
5. **Already doing it vs called to it** — "我们已经、正在、且也将继续"; the task is to *notice*, not to become

**Key insight:** The author shifts the question from "How do I become authentic?" to "How do I notice that I already am?"

**Vote:** Should this finding be included in:
- **A) The Translator's Preface**
- **B) The Translator's Afterword** (in the cross-traditional connections section)
- **C) Not included** (leave it in the expert report only)

Respond with A, B, or C, with brief reason.

But it cannot go in the Preface for two reasons:\n\n1. **Spoiler concern:** The passage comes from the Appendix (Essay 8), which is the last thing the reader encounters. Discussing \"we are already poets of our own lives\" in the Preface would pre-reveal the collection's culminating gesture — the moment where the author turns from formal apparatus back to lived practice. This is structurally analogous to the Essay 3 cat punchline: the recognition that we are *already doing it* is the experiential payoff of t
