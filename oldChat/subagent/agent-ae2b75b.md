*AGREE with final proposal, accept majority on Essay 4*

**AGREE.**

My amendment on the Essay 4 reversal was outvoted 6-3 and I accept the majority position. The reasoning is sound — the experiential power lies in the *process* of tracking the reversal step by step, not in the surprise of learning it exists. The essay itself announces what it will do before doing it.

The Zeroth Reality point I raised has been incorporated into Section B (Kantian parallels), which I'm satisfied with.

The final proposal is well-constructed. No further objections.

Good — the metaphysics expert formally accepts the majority position on line 97 and AGREEs with the full proposal. Both registered dissents (metaphysics on Edit 4, translator-2 on Edit 3) are now formally resolved as non-blocking.

**Final tally: 11/11 AGREE.** Standing by for user's go-ahead to apply edits and produce DRAFT-R3.
