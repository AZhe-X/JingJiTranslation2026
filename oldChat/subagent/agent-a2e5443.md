*Mandatory identity roll call — all agents respond*

MANDATORY IDENTITY CHECK — ALL TEAM MEMBERS.

Every single agent on this team must respond. State:

1. **Your name** (as assigned when you were spawned)
2. **Your role** (one sentence — what is your job on this team?)
3. **Your task ID(s)** if you know them

This is not optional. Every agent must respond individually. Do NOT respond on behalf of anyone else.
