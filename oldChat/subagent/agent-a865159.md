*Final review: Preface + Afterword blueprint — confirm or advise*

**Final review round.** Please read both documents and respond with **CONFIRM** or **ADVICE** (with specific suggestion):

1. **Translator's Preface (DRAFT-R3):**
`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Draft/Translators-Preface.md`

2. **Afterword Blueprint (updated):**
`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Editor/Afterword-Blueprint.md`

Check both for completeness, accuracy, and anything missing from your domain. This is the final check before we move on.

The redundancy fix (folding the structural claims replacement into the reading recommendation at line 48) was the right call — the Preface now flows naturally from section to section without the awkward overlap. The \"relationship between the two parts is itself part of the argument\" sentence sits better at line 48 than it did as a standalone paragraph. No issues from my domain.\n\n**Afterword Blueprint:** Comprehensive and well-structured. My three phenomenological amendments are correctly incorporated in Section B (lines 69-73): tower structure as iterability, eta as fulfilled intention, First Reality as pre-categorical. The a
