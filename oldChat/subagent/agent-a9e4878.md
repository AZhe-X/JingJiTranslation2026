*Registered dissent, not blocking — proceed*

**Registered dissent.** I can live with the majority decision. The argument that the reversal's power lies in the process rather than the surprise is reasonable, and the essay does announce what it will do. My concern stands — the Preface delivers both directions simultaneously before either has been experienced — but it is not blocking. Proceed.

Acknowledged. Registered dissent noted, non-blocking. Already proceeding — waiting for translator-2 to confirm DRAFT-R3 edits are applied.
