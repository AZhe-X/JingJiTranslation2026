*Update reports re: intersubjectivity and philosophical experiments*

Follow-up: Based on the discussion we just had about intersubjectivity via η and the essays as philosophical experiments, please review your Analysis Report in your workspace directory:

/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/[Your Field]/Analysis Report.md

If your report mentions intersubjectivity or philosophical experiments, please update those sections to reflect the deeper understanding we've now reached. Specifically:

1. If you mentioned intersubjectivity — update to reflect the η-based structural commensurability account.
2. If you mentioned philosophical experiments — update to identify specific passages that function as experiments on the reader, and note the translation implication (experiential sequence is load-bearing, not merely illustrative).

If your report does NOT mention either topic, you may add a brief section if you think it's warranted, or skip this update if it's not relevant to your field.

Read your report first, then edit only the relevant sections. Do not rewrite the whole report.

Let me read my current report and identify sections that need updating.

Good. I can see that:

1. **Intersubjectivity** is mentioned briefly in section 5 (the qualia sidestep) and section 9 (strength #2), but without the deeper eta-based account.
2. **Philosophical experiments** are mentioned in section 5, but without identifying specific passages or the translation implication about performative structure.

Let me update both sections.

Now let me update the intersubjectivity discussion. The current report mentions the qualia sidestep briefly in section 5 and in "Avoids the hard problem" in section 9. The natural place is to expand section 6 (natural transformation eta) to include the intersubjectivity account, since eta is the mechanism.
