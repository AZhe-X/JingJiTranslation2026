*Check Preface for unauthorized edits by wittgenstein*

Important: wittgenstein-expert admitted to editing the Translator's Preface file without authorization. They applied two edits:

1. **Removed the working-draft quality paragraph** from the Author section
2. **Simplified the Bilingual Collection forward references** (replaced "digestion anticipates the formal functor structure" language)

Please re-read the Preface file and verify its current state. Check whether:
- Any of your intended content was lost or altered
- The working-draft paragraph is present or missing (you said you restored it)
- Anything else looks unexpected

Report back what you find.

Working-draft quality paragraph (line 34):** PRESENT. It reads: \"The collection is a working document. Several essays contain todo markers, incomplete sections, and self-corrections. We have preserved these deliberately...\" -- This is exactly what I restored in my revision pass. It was NOT removed by wittgenstein-expert.\n\n**2. Bilingual Collection forward references (line 62):** This reads: \"We have added a brief translator's note at the opening of Essay 2 connecting its key terms -- particularly 'phenomena' and 'digestion' -- to their counterparts in the translated essays.

Report sent to team lead. The file is intact -- all my content is present, no unauthorized changes detected. Still standing by for the Option B vote resolution and coordinated final revision pass.
