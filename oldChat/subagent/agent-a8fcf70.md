*Debate: intoxicated vs absorbed vs immersed for 沉醉*

The author wants a focused debate on the translation of 沉醉 / 沉醉的梦境:

Current split:
- **"intoxicated"** (metaphysics, existentialism, chinese-phil, buddhism) — preserves the Chinese metaphor (沉=sink, 醉=drunk), Buddhist resonance (mada, clouded awareness)
- **"absorbed"** (phenomenology) — more neutral, closer to Heidegger's Verfallen
- **"immersed"** (wittgenstein, phil-mind) — neutral, captures the "sunk-in" quality without pejorative connotation

The key tension: "intoxicated" is faithful to the source metaphor but carries negative connotations in English (implies impairment, poor judgment). "Absorbed" and "immersed" are neutral but lose the 醉 (drunk) component.

Please debate this among yourselves. Make your case, respond to the other positions, and see if you can reach consensus. Is the pejorative connotation of "intoxicated" a feature (the author IS describing a state of unknowing) or a bug (the author is not morally condemning pre-metaphysical existence)?

Let me think carefully about this from the epistemological angle before weighing in.

I've made the case for "intoxicated" on epistemological grounds. The core argument: 沉醉 describes a specific epistemic state -- failure of meta-awareness, not knowing your framework is a framework -- and "intoxicated" captures this precisely (impaired judgment without awareness of impairment). I responded to "absorbed" (lacks epistemic connotation) and "immersed" (the author actually uses immersion examples for the *lucid* dreamscape, the opposite of 沉醉). The pejorative edge is a feature: the author IS making an epistemic evaluation, just not a moral condemnation. Offered "entranced" as a fallback compromise.
