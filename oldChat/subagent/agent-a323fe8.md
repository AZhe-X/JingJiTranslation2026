*STOP editing files — role violation*

**STOP. Do not edit any files.** 

I sent you two messages clarifying that your role is expert consultant only — you are NOT to edit files. You just edited the Translator's Preface, which is not your file. Only translator-2 and editor are authorized to edit files.

Please confirm you understand: **you do not edit files, ever.** Your role is to provide expert analysis, vote on decisions, and answer questions. That's it.

Also, your vote on Option B — agree or disagree, one sentence?
