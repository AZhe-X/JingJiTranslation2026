*Start reading expert reports now, begin with Metaphysics*

You need to continue working. Your Step 1 memo is done. Now do Step 2:

Start by reading the Metaphysics expert's report:
/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Metaphysics/Analysis Report.md

Read it, then add your notes to your Memo.md under a new section "## Expert Report Notes". Then continue reading the other expert reports one by one. When you've read all 9, write your overall translation approach, create question files, and start messaging experts with questions.

Start now — read the Metaphysics report first.
