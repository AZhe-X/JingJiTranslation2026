*Romanized terms kill the philosophical experiment*

The author raises a critical point about the "philosophical experiment" argument:

If we romanize everything — Dao, De, Ren, Yi, Li — then the passage has NO English semantic content for the Western reader. The reader encounters five opaque foreign terms in a sequence. The "philosophical experiment" (where the reader first accepts a conventional understanding, then watches it get deconstructed) CANNOT work, because the reader never had a conventional understanding to begin with. The romanized terms have very few morphisms in their Jing — they are semantically empty for the English reader.

The experiment requires the reader to FEEL something when they read "virtue," "humaneness," "righteousness" — to bring their own associations — and THEN experience the reversal. If they just see "De, Ren, Yi, Li," they have nothing to reverse. The passage becomes an abstract report about foreign concepts rather than a lived philosophical experience.

Does this change your thinking? Should we use English translations (the Way, virtue, humaneness, rightness, ritual conduct) in the block quote precisely SO the philosophical experiment works on the English reader?

Reconsider. Brief response.

Changed my position. The author's argument is compelling -- and it is, fittingly, an argument from within the author's own philosophical framework. The reversal can only work as a *philosophical experiment* if the English reader brings semantic associations to the table. Romanized terms give them nothing to reverse. Full English in the block quote, then the shift to "(constitutive) character" for 德 hits harder precisely because the reader felt what "virtue" meant first.
