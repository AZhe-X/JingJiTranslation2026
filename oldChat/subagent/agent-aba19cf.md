*Suggest Editor agent profile requirements*

We're creating an Editor agent for the team. What should their profile look like?

From your field's perspective, list the key skills, qualities, and responsibilities this Editor should have. Think about:
- What prose-level issues from your domain would they need to catch?
- What register/style sensitivities are essential?
- What should they NOT do (i.e., boundaries between Editor and expert/translator roles)?

Be concise — bullet points preferred.
