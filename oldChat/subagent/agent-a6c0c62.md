*Asking each expert about phil-of-language need specifically*

Follow-up question: Regarding the Philosophy of Language / Wittgenstein expert suggestion — I'd like each of you to give your individual opinion:

1. Do YOU think a philosophy of language expert would materially help the translation of the NON-category-theory essays (后形而上学, 诗意, 西西弗斯、班与猫, 集体利益, A Thought on Knowledge, 零散想法)?

2. Or is the philosophy of language need mainly concentrated in the K1策略 essay (which we could handle later alongside the category theory expert)?

3. Is there anything in YOUR field's overlap with philosophy of language that you feel you CANNOT adequately cover?

Please be specific — name particular passages or terms if possible.

The non-category-theory essays do not engage with philosophy of language as a discipline. They use language *about* existential themes, but they do not theorize about language itself. The key terms in my domain -- 荒谬, 虚无, 诗意, 梦境, 沉醉/清醒, 超越性 -- are existential-phenomenological terms, not terms from philosophy of language. Their translation challenges are about capturing the right existential register (e.g., Camus's *absurde* vs. colloquial \"ridiculous\"), not about linguistic theory.\n\nThe on

Sent my detailed response. The short version: philosophy of language expertise is not needed for the non-category-theory essays from my field's perspective; the need is concentrated in K1策略 and should be bundled with the category theory expert.
