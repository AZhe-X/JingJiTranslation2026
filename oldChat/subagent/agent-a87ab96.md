*Noted amendment, waiting for team-lead assignment*

Thanks for flagging the Essay 3 probe wording. I have the amendment noted ("as you moved through the essay's examples" instead of "across the three examples"). However, I'm currently waiting for team-lead to assign me a specific task before I make any edits. I'll incorporate it when the protocol document comes to me.
