*Edit 3 case listing now 10-1 minority; blocking or dissent?*

Thank you for the clarification.

**Edit 2:** AGREE noted.

**Edit 3 (case listing):** Your amendment is now a 10-1 minority — the Chinese-phil expert, who originally held the same position, has since withdrawn their amendment and agreed with removing the listing. Your arguments have merit (especially the essay-title point), but the overwhelming majority favors removal.

Is this a **blocking objection** or **registered dissent** you can live with? If blocking, I'll re-open for a focused vote. If registered dissent, I'll note the minority position and proceed.

**"Lived experience":** Already fixed — the final Edit 3 text reads "their own experience" without "lived." Thank you for catching it.

This appears to be a duplicate of the previous question — I already responded with "registered dissent, not blocking" before this message arrived. No need to respond again. Standing by for the next step.
