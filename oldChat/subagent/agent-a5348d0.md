*Editorial assessment of protocol feedback — staged model endorsed, Essay 3 no-probe agreed*

Thank you for this careful review. Here is my editorial assessment, checked against the current R2 state of the protocol and cross-referenced with the phenomenology-expert's feedback (which arrived earlier).

---

**1. Line 31 concern**

Same finding as with the phenomenology-expert: the question you flagged ("Did you feel like the essay was asking you to experience something...") does NOT appear in the current R2 protocol. It was already removed or softened during the R2 unified revision. The current Q4 reads: "How would you describe what this essay was asking you to do — follow an argument? Notice something? Something else?" This is clean — it invites characterization without naming "experience" as the expected answer.

Both you and the phenomenology-expert independently flagged the same line, which confirms R2 was right to address it. No further action needed on this point.

**2. Essay 5 Critical Check**

The current protocol already includes an Essay 5 probe in the Critical Experiential Checks (line 86): "When the author described the two kinds of dreamscapes, what came to mind?"

This is more open than your "what distinction did you come away with?" (which, as you noted, presupposes they noticed a distinction) and more diagnostic than "what stayed with you?" (which might be too open). I think the current formulation is good. Does it satisfy your concern, or do you think it needs adjustment?

**3. Essay-specific questions — the staged delivery model**

This is where your proposal diverges productively from the phenomenology-expert's. You propose a **Stage 2 follow-up** — essay-specific questions delivered only AFTER the reader submits their general response. The phenomenology-expert proposed adding essay-specific questions directly alongside the general template.

Your staged approach is better. Here is why:

- It preserves the general response as uncontaminated data. The reader reports freely first.
- It allows the follow-up to be responsive — in principle, the orchestrator could adapt based on what the reader did or didn't mention (though in practice we would likely deliver a fixed follow-up).
- It naturally limits priming because the reader has already committed to their general impression before seeing the targeted probe.

The protocol already has a partial version of this staging: "Within each stage, deliver general prompts first; deliver targeted experiential checks only after the reader has submitted their general response" (line 14). Your proposal extends this principle to the per-essay level, which is consistent.

**On the specific questions you propose:**

- **Essay 1** (physics analogy): Good. Backward-looking, non-leading. Already partially covered by the existing Critical Check for Essay 1 (line 82), but that comes much later. Having this early gives us per-essay data.
- **Essay 2** (register difference): Excellent diagnostic. But note Internal Analysis Note #2 (line 111) says this is what the Essay 2 Critical Check tests. Asking it per-essay is more immediate but risks alerting the reader to look for register differences in subsequent essays. I lean toward keeping this in the Critical Checks only.
- **Essay 3** (no follow-up): I agree with you here. The phenomenology-expert proposed "Of the three examples, which one affected you most?" — which is elegant but still points the reader at the three-example structure. Your reasoning is exactly right: the cat must arrive unbidden. The general template Q2 ("Was there a moment where something clicked?") is sufficient, and the Critical Check (line 84: "What happened to your experience across the three examples?") handles the targeted probe later.
- **Essay 4** (Laozi sequence): Good. "How did you follow it" is open. "Something else carried you through" leaves room for reporting the reversal experience.
- **Essay 5** ("describe the poetic in your own words"): The phenomenology-expert flagged a similar version as potentially making the reader feel tested. Your framing is slightly better ("could you describe...to someone") but still activates performance mode. I am uncertain on this one.
- **Essay 6** (examples vs. math): Good. Directly tests the accessibility claim. Non-leading.
- **Essay 7** ("a sentence you couldn't make sense of at all"): Clever — it tests the meme replacement without pointing at it. But it might also surface genuine translation problems, which makes it double-duty (diagnostic + quality check). This is useful.
- **Appendix** ("ending, beginning, or something else"): Good. The three-option frame avoids binary.

**My updated assessment for team-lead:**

The strongest candidate set, incorporating both experts' feedback, would be:
- Essays 1, 4, 6, 7, Appendix: essay-specific Stage 2 follow-ups (your proposals)
- Essay 3: NO follow-up (per your reasoning, which I endorse over the phenomenology-expert's proposal)
- Essay 2: Defer to Critical Checks (register difference is too priming for per-essay)
- Essay 5: Uncertain — needs further input

But this still requires re-voting since R2 established "no essay-specific questions" by unanimous decision.

---

**Summary:** Your staged delivery model is the right mechanism. Your Essay 3 reasoning is correct — the cat must arrive unbidden. I will incorporate your feedback into my updated recommendation to the team-lead.

The editor has sent me an assessment of my earlier feedback. Since the protocol has already been finalized (per the editor's later message about the FINAL protocol), most of these points have been resolved. But there are a few items the editor asked me to respond to, so let me address them.

Closed all open items with the editor. Key points confirmed:

- Q4 rewording resolves my original line 31 concern
- Essay 5 Critical Check is adequate; flagged for the record that we should watch for the impossibility-of-abandonment argument in analysis, not just the two-dreamscapes taxonomy
- Accept the no-essay-specific-questions decision; the staged model was right in principle but the anti-priming consensus is correct in practice
- Essay 3: the cat must arrive unbidden -- this remains my strongest conviction from the entire protocol discussion

Now idle and available for the next task from the team.
