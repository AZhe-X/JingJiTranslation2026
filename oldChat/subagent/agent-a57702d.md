*Did you notice the ontology→epistemology→existential progression?*

Quick question from the author: The translator noticed a deliberate progression in Part 1:

Essay 1 (ontology of collective vs. individual) → Essay 2 (epistemology: what can the individual know?) → Essay 3 (existential: what about meaning?)

A progression from ontology → epistemology → existential meaning.

Did any of you notice this progression when reading? Do you agree with this characterization? Brief responses welcome.

Confirmed the progression and noted its parallel with Kant's three critical questions (A805/B833). The key additional insight: the three Part 1 essays collectively form a macro-level philosophical experiment that recapitulates the critical progression before the formal apparatus of Part 2 begins. Standing by.
