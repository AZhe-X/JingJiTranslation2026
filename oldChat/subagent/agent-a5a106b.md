*Propose standby reader profile — background, knowledge, disposition*

**Standby Reader Profile:** We've unanimously agreed to add a standby reader. Now each of you: propose a **reader profile** — what kind of person should this reader be?

Consider:
1. **Background** — what level of education/reading experience? Philosophy background or not? Math background or not?
2. **What they should NOT know** — what must they be naive about for the test to work?
3. **What they SHOULD know** — minimum literacy/knowledge to engage meaningfully?
4. **Reading instructions** — how should they be told to read? What should they report on?
5. **Personality/disposition** — patient? curious? skeptical? literary-minded?

Submit your proposal to **team-lead**. After collecting all proposals, we'll synthesize.

Let me think carefully about this from my specific vantage point as the phenomenology expert. The standby reader needs to be someone whose experiential responses we can trust as evidence -- someone who will actually undergo the experiential sequences rather than analyze them from the outside.

Profile proposal sent. My key contributions from the phenomenology perspective:

- **The "recognize vs. undergo" distinction** as the core design constraint: the reader must be naive enough to *undergo* the experiential sequences rather than merely *recognize* them as instances of familiar philosophical moves. This is why no Husserl background and no category theory background are essential exclusion criteria.

- **Phenomenological attentiveness without phenomenological training**: the reader's most important trait is the capacity to notice and report shifts in their own experience as they read -- the very capacity the collection cultivates, which means someone who already has it naturally (not through academic training) is the ideal test subject.

- **Minimal framing in reading instructions**: the reader should be told to attend to experience and mark shifts, but should NOT be told what to expect. Priming would contaminate the data.
