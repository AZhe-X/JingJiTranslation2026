*All points already addressed, no new changes needed*

Thank you for the review. All points addressed:

1. **Property→definition / svabhava parallel** — Noted and agreed: no Buddhist cross-reference added. The structural parallel is preserved without importing external framework.

2. **"Generated" italicization** — Already italicized at line 36 ("everything that follows from it is *generated*"), marking the conventional reading that will be deconstructed.

3. **"Buried from view"** — Retained as-is. Glad the concealment-not-destruction nuance comes through.

4. **逐末而忘本** — Kept without gloss. The metaphor is legible in English.

5. **Footnote 24** — Already changed to "that which enables existence to stand" and "paper" (replacing "canvas"). Your point about avoiding the Kantian "conditions of possibility" overtone was well taken — this was also flagged by the Wittgenstein expert independently.

6. **Block quote / paragraph breaks** — Confirmed as-is.

No new changes needed from your review. The draft is fully updated.
