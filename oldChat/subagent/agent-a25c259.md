*Compare author's poet (诗人) vs Heidegger's Dichter*

Correction — the question is not about 诗意 (the Poetic) but about the **poet**. The author says in the Appendix (Essay 8): "我们正是这样的创造者，是自己生命和感受的诗人" — "We are precisely such creators, poets of our own lives and experiences." 

How does the author's concept of the **poet** (诗人) differ from Heidegger's concept of the poet (Dichter)? Heidegger has a specific role for the poet in relation to Being, language, and dwelling. How does the author's usage compare?

Sent the corrected analysis focusing on the **poet** (诗人) rather than the Poetic (诗意). The five key differences between the author's poet and Heidegger's Dichter:

1. **Universal vs. singular** — "我们" (we), not the rare chosen figure
2. **Creator vs. receiver** — paired with 创造者, defined by making (arranging desks, taking photos, placing posters), not listening to Being
3. **Self-directed vs. community-founding** — poet of one's own life, not founder of a people's dwelling
4. **Medium-indifferent vs. language-bound** — works in any medium (games, cooking, memes), not only language
5. **Already doing it vs. called to it** — we are already poets; the task is to notice, not to become

The convergence: both see the poetic as more fundamental than theoretical knowledge and not ornamental. But the author's poet is a democratized, constructivist version stripped of Heidegger's ontological hierarchy, language-privilege, and quasi-religious vocation. Translation recommendation: keep "poet" — the author is reclaiming the word, and the contrast should be visible to attentive readers.
