*Romanized terms kill the philosophical experiment*

The author raises a critical point about the "philosophical experiment" argument:

If we romanize everything — Dao, De, Ren, Yi, Li — then the passage has NO English semantic content for the Western reader. The reader encounters five opaque foreign terms in a sequence. The "philosophical experiment" (where the reader first accepts a conventional understanding, then watches it get deconstructed) CANNOT work, because the reader never had a conventional understanding to begin with. The romanized terms have very few morphisms in their Jing — they are semantically empty for the English reader.

The experiment requires the reader to FEEL something when they read "virtue," "humaneness," "righteousness" — to bring their own associations — and THEN experience the reversal. If they just see "De, Ren, Yi, Li," they have nothing to reverse. The passage becomes an abstract report about foreign concepts rather than a lived philosophical experience.

Does this change your thinking? Should we use English translations (the Way, virtue, humaneness, rightness, ritual conduct) in the block quote precisely SO the philosophical experiment works on the English reader?

Reconsider. Brief response.

The author is right. I'm reversing again — back to full English translations in the block quote.

The argument is phenomenologically precise: the philosophical experiment requires **pre-reflective semantic content** that the reader brings to the encounter. "Virtue" activates a rich network of associations — Aristotelian, Christian, everyday moral intuitions — that the author can then destabilize. "De" activates nothing for the English reader. It's a phoneme without a horizon.

This is exactly the structure of phenomenological reduction: you start with the natural attitude (the reader's naive understanding of "virtue"), then perform the epoché (the author's analysis shows why that understanding is inadequate), and the reader arrives at a transformed understanding ("constitutive character"). The reduction **cannot operate on empty content**. You cannot bracket what was never posited.

So:

- "the Way" — not "Dao" — because the reader needs to feel the metaphysical weight of "Way" (path, method, direction) before the author reframes it
- "virtue" — not "De" — because the reader needs their Aristotelian/moral associations activated before the shift to "character"
- "humaneness," "rightness," "ritual conduct" — because even these carry English semantic resonance that pure romanization does not

I was wrong to reverse on "Dao." The glossed format with characters and pinyin already gives the specialist reader the Chinese — the English term is there for the *philosophical work* of the passage, not just for identification.

Reversed back to full English in the block quote. The author's point is phenomenologically decisive: the philosophical experiment requires the reader to have semantic content that can be destabilized. Romanized terms are opaque to English readers — you can't perform an epoché on empty content. "The Way," "virtue," "humaneness," "rightness," "ritual conduct" all carry the associative weight the passage needs to do its philosophical work.
