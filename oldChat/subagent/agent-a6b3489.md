*Check 境界 occurrences in source texts — traditional or technical?*

Follow-up question from the author on 境界: Since 境界 also contains 境, we need to check whether the -scape link should apply here too, or whether 境界 is used in its traditional sense (boundary/realm/level of attainment).

Could you check where 境界 actually appears in the original essays and assess: is the author using 境界 in a way that connects to the technical concept 境, or in its traditional/conventional sense? Does the 境 inside 境界 matter the same way the 境 inside 梦境 matters?

The source texts are at:
/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录/
/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/22 随笔/

Please check the actual occurrences and give your assessment. Brief responses welcome.

Let me search for all occurrences of 境界 across the essays.

[tool: Grep]
{
  "pattern": "境界",
  "path": "/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章",
  "output_mode": "content",
  "-n": true,
  "-C": 1
}

The long lines were omitted. Let me read the specific passages directly to see the full context.

[tool: Read]
{
  "file_path": "/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录/范畴论与境 整理.md",
  "offset": 15,
  "limit": 15
}

Good. Now I have a complete picture. Let me send the assessment.

[tool: SendMessage]
{
  "type": "message",
  "recipient": "team-lead",
  "summary": "境界 occurrences checked — all in one essay, dual usage",
  "content": "I checked all 8 essays. 境界 appears **only** in 范畴论与境 整理 (and its draft counterpart 范畴论与境), concentrated in the \"前言\" (foreword) section. It does not appear in any other essay. Here are the occurrences:\n\n### Occurrence 1 (line 17):\n\n> \"正如我们在语言的*境界*（界限）内，要界定一个词语的*意思*（内在的本质），我们不得不使用*其他的语言*（外在的延伸）。因此在这一*境界*内，对*内在*本质的探索就是对其*外在*的延伸的明晰。\"\n\nHere the author **explicitly glosses** 境界 as 界限 (boundary/limit).

Standing by. The 境界 analysis has been sent. Ready for further questions from the team lead or translators.
