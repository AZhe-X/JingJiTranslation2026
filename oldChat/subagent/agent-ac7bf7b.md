*Q3: How to handle already-English Essay 2*

I'm the translator for the 境集 collection. Quick question about Essay 2 ("A Thought on Knowledge"), which is already written in English by the author.

The translation project covers the 7 Chinese essays. Essay 2 stays in English. But I need to ensure terminological consistency across the collection. Here's what I've checked:

- Essay 2 uses "phenomena" — aligns with our rendering of 现象. Good.
- Essay 2 uses "belief" — aligns with 信念. Good.
- Essay 2 doesn't use 境, 形而上, 恒常, or other Part 2 technical terms. No conflict.
- Essay 2's register is more formal/analytic than the Chinese essays' colloquial/thinking-aloud register.

My questions:

1. **Should we leave Essay 2 entirely untouched?** Or add a brief translator's note connecting its terminology to the Chinese essays? For example: a note explaining that "phenomena" here is the same concept as 现象 (First Reality) in the later essays, or that the "digestion" of phenomena into belief anticipates the formal apparatus of functors in K1策略.

2. **The register difference** — Essay 2 reads like an analytic philosophy paper while Essays 1 and 3 read like informal reflections. Is this register difference a feature of the bilingual collection (showing the author can operate in both modes) or something that should be smoothed?

3. **Are there any terms in Essay 2 that you think need a translator's footnote** to help the English reader connect them to the broader framework developed in the Chinese essays?

I would suggest a note covering three connections:\n\n- **\"Phenomena\" = 现象 = First Reality (第一实在)**: Essay 2 introduces \"phenomena\" informally (\"what we experience or observe\"), and the later essays formalize this as 第一实在 and then as $\\mathfrak{P}$.

I've sent detailed answers to the translator covering all three questions:

1. **Leave Essay 2 untouched** but add a brief translator's note connecting "phenomena," "digestion," and the three justification bases to their formal counterparts in the later essays.

2. **Preserve the register difference** -- it is a feature, not a bug. The analytic English register vs. the Chinese 随笔 register demonstrates the collection's own point about different 境 with different stable structures. Do not smooth it.

3. **Three specific terms need footnotes**: "digestion" (maps to the embedding functor), "what each individual believes to be correct" (maps to the knowledge category), and "standard" (maps to the stable structure $S_K$). Standard philosophical terms like "phenomena" and "belief" should NOT be footnoted.
