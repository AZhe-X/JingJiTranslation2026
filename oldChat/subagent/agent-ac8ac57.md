*Asking all experts if any expertise is missing*

Team update: Here are the 8 experts currently on this translation team:

1. Metaphysics / Ontology
2. Phenomenology (Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty)
3. Epistemology
4. Existentialism / Absurdism / Nihilism
5. Philosophy of Mind / Cognitive Science
6. Kantian / Transcendental Philosophy
7. Classical Chinese Philosophy (Confucianism, Daoism, Neo-Confucianism)
8. Buddhism (Madhyamaka, Yogacara, Chan/Zen)

Question for each of you: Given the essays you've read, is there a significant expert perspective MISSING from this team? Or do you think these 8 cover the ground adequately? 

Think about: Are there terms, arguments, or frameworks in the essays that none of us are well-equipped to handle? Would adding a specific expert materially improve the translation quality?

Please respond with your honest assessment.

I've sent my assessment to the team lead. My key recommendation is that a **category theory / mathematical foundations expert** is the most significant missing perspective, given how heavily Essays #6 and #7 rely on formal categorical apparatus that is structurally integral to the philosophical arguments. A philosophy of language expert would be a secondary but useful addition.
