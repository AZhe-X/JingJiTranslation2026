*All 8 drafting notes for Afterword Blueprint*

**Drafting notes from all experts** — please add these to the Afterword Blueprint for future reference. All are non-blocking, confirmed by the team as drafting-stage concerns:

1. **Wittgenstein-expert:** Add Kripke's *Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language* to the Further Reading list for readers pursuing the rule-following/intersubjectivity thread.

2. **Buddhism-expert:** In the Chan/Zen Buddha-nature parallel, note that in Chan, recognition typically requires a teacher and intensive practice (参禅, koan work), while the author's framework suggests recognition can occur through any medium — making the author more radically democratic than even Chan.

3. **Kantian-expert:** In Section E (temporality), sharpen the point with Kant's account of time as form of inner sense — the author's discrete evolution functor T does not engage with inner time-consciousness or the temporality of synthesis.

4. **Metaphysics-expert:** In Section A, include the Four Kinds of Metaphysics (第〇/一/二/三种形而上) as the mechanism by which bottom-up construction operates.

5. **Epistemology-expert:** Make the access argument explicit as the bridge between Essay 2 and the K1 strategy — it shows justification reduces to belief, which necessitates the K1 approach to belief-structure evolution.

6. **Translator-2:** (a) Expand Section D with register-shift challenges (colloquial ↔ technical ↔ classical ↔ formal). (b) Echo the 诗人 passage ("我们正是这样的创造者") in the Closing to bridge the poet analysis into the return-to-experience ending.

7. **Editor + Chinese-phil-expert:** Merge the Xunzi overlap at lines 108/114 — consolidate Xunzi material at 108, keep line 114 focused on commentarial tradition (Heshang Gong, Wang Bi) separately.

8. **Editor (Preface note):** Lines 48 and 105 both recommend sequential reading. Intentional repetition — flagged but kept.
