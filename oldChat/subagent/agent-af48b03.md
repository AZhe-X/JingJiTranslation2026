*Weight profile dimensions + vote on *

**Two items for the standby reader profile:**

**Item 1: Weight each profile dimension by significance (out of 10).**

Score each dimension from 1-10 for how important it is to getting the right standby reader:

- A. Education level (graduate-level humanities)
- B. No philosophy specialization
- C. No category theory / formal math
- D. No prior exposure to these essays or our materials
- E. Basic cultural literacy (Sisyphus, metaphysics, Laozi)
- F. Comfort with abstract ideas and sustained argument
- G. Tolerance for foreign terms and mathematical notation on page
- H. Curious and patient disposition
- I. Honest about confusion / not deferential
- J. **Experientially attentive** — notices what happens to them while reading
- K. Life experience (has worked a job, owned a pet, faced decisions)
- L. Reads literary fiction / attentive to prose quality

**Item 2: Vote on "Tell a friend what this is about" as a final prompt.**

The editor proposed asking the standby reader, after completing the full collection: "What would you tell a friend this collection is about?"

Vote: **YES** (keep this prompt) or **NO** (suggest a different/better final prompt).

Reading stamina and interpretive confidence matter more than the credential. A well-read autodidact or a thoughtful undergraduate honors student could serve equally well. I overweighted this in my original proposal. |\n| B. No philosophy specialization | 8 | High. A philosophy specialist will recognize the moves rather than undergo them. The entire Fish-to-Fishing arc depends on the reader building intuitions in Part 1 that Part 2 then formalizes -- a trained philosopher will see the formalization coming. |\n| C. No category theory / formal math

Response sent. My key contributions on this round:

**Item 1 (Weights):** I scored D (no prior exposure) and J (experiential attentiveness) both at 10 -- the two non-negotiable traits. I self-corrected on education level (dropped to 6, acknowledging I overweighted credentials in my original proposal). The rationale for J being maximal: the collection's method IS experiential, so a reader who cannot report on their own experience while reading cannot test what most needs testing.

**Item 2 (Prompt vote):** YES with a refinement -- split the "tell a friend" prompt into two parts: "What is it *about*?" and "What is it *like* to read?" The split separates content comprehension from experiential registration, and mirrors the Fish/Fishing structure itself. If the reader spontaneously connects the two parts in their answer, that is our strongest success signal.
