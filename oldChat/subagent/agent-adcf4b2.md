*Spoiler resolution task: submit plans to editor*

## SPOILER RESOLUTION TASK

We have unanimous agreement on three things:
1. The Translator's Preface has spoilers (11/11 YES)
2. We will add a **Translator's Afterword** (placed after essays, before Glossary) (10 YES, 1 OPTIONAL)
3. Spoiler-level content should move from Preface to Afterword (11/11 AGREE)

### The Spoiler Locations (in current DRAFT-R2 Preface)

**Most damaging** — Essay 3 cat punchline:
- Line 46: "feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat"
- Line 50: The full structural claims paragraph — "the author treats nihilism not as the negation of metaphysics but as its *consequence*... absurdity arises when one's Jing seeks meaning externally and finds none. The dissolution of absurdity -- demonstrated in Essay 3 through the progression from Sisyphus to cat ownership -- occurs not through revolt but through inhabiting a Jing in which meaning is internally generated."
- Lines 95-96: "no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move."

**8/11 voted the structural claims paragraph (line 50) is NOT FINE** as currently written.

### Your Task

Each of you: formulate your own **plan for how to resolve the spoilers**. Consider:
1. What exactly should be removed/softened in the Preface?
2. What should the Afterword contain? (Scope, structure, tone)
3. How to handle the Essay 3 punchline specifically — can it be hinted at without spoiling?
4. Any content currently in the Preface that should stay despite being somewhat revelatory?
5. What new content (if any) should the Afterword add beyond moved spoilers?

### Process
- **Everyone (all 9 experts + translator + editor):** Submit your individual plan to **editor**.
- **Editor:** After receiving all 10 plans (+ your own), orchestrate a unified full plan.
- **Editor:** Send the full plan to all experts for advice.
- **Back and forth until agreement.** Everyone uses their own judgment.

Use your domain expertise. Metaphysics expert: think about what readers need to know about post-metaphysics before reading vs. after. Existentialism expert: think about what the absurdity argument needs protected. Chinese-phil expert: think about the Dao-De reversal. Etc.

**Submit your plan to editor now.**

Let me think carefully about this from the Chinese philosophy perspective before submitting my plan.

It pre-states two conclusions that are designed to emerge from experiential sequences:\n- \"nihilism not as the negation of metaphysics but as its consequence\" — Essay 4 walks the reader through the 前形而上学 → 虚无主义 → 后形而上学 progression; stating the thesis destroys the discovery.\n- The entire absurdity-dissolution mechanism (\"arises when one's Jing seeks meaning externally...occurs not through revolt but through inhabiting a Jing in which meaning is internally generated\") — this is literally the philosophical payoff of Essa

Plan submitted to the editor. I've addressed all five questions from my Chinese philosophy domain perspective, with particular attention to:

- The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li reversal (how much to reveal vs. conceal)
- The classical Chinese precedent for letting texts speak for themselves (论语 model)
- The Afterword as the proper home for cross-traditional scholarly context (paralleling the 注/疏 commentarial tradition)
- Specific softened replacement text for the Essay 3 and Essay 4 examples
