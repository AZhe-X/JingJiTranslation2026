*Final review: Preface + Afterword blueprint — confirm or advise*

**Final review round.** Please read both documents and respond with **CONFIRM** or **ADVICE** (with specific suggestion):

1. **Translator's Preface (DRAFT-R3):**
`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Draft/Translators-Preface.md`

2. **Afterword Blueprint (updated):**
`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Editor/Afterword-Blueprint.md`

Check both for completeness, accuracy, and anything missing from your domain. This is the final check before we move on.

The redundancy fix (merging the old line 50 content into the existing Fish/Fishing section rather than having it stand as a separate paragraph) was the right call -- the Preface now flows naturally from structural orientation into the reading recommendation without a jarring standalone paragraph restating what line 44 already covered. All Chinese philosophical content is accurate: the 形/现象 reinterpretation section (lines 62-77) correctly identifies the Xici zhuan source, accurately describes the traditional reading, and honestly flags the author's departure. The terminology note correctly handles the 德 split and the 形而上/形而上学 distinction
