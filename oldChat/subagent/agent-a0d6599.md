*APPROVE all 8 revisions — one minor suggestion on Essay 5 probe wording*

**APPROVE** the plan as a whole. Notes on individual revisions:

**Revision 1 (baseline expectation):** APPROVE. Smart addition — the reader's pre-reading expectations become the control against which we measure actual experience.

**Revision 2 (defer Q4 to Part 2):** APPROVE. Better than my own suggestion of rewording it — simply not asking it during Fish preserves the naivete the structure depends on.

**Revision 3 (split engagement/pacing):** APPROVE. Correct — these are distinct questions that get flattened when combined.

**Revision 4 (stayed with you / didn't land):** APPROVE. I withdraw my mild preference for the original. "Stayed with you / didn't land" is better — it keeps the reader reporting on their experience rather than grading the essays.

**Revision 5 (marginal notes):** APPROVE. The optional framing is right. Pre-reflective data is more valuable than retrospective answers to our questions.

**Revision 6 (NO essay-specific per-essay questions):** APPROVE. The unanimous reasoning is correct and I accept it. My proposal was designed with the same anti-priming concern (deliver after generic response) but the team is right that even post-generic delivery during the reading sequence creates cross-essay contamination. Asking about the physics comparison after Essay 1 *will* change how the reader encounters physics metaphors in later essays. The architecture of generic-during, targeted-after is the clean solution, and Revision 7 captures the substance of what my essay-specific questions were trying to test — just at the right time.

**Revision 7 (expand Critical Checks to 8):** APPROVE. These cover the ground my essay-specific questions were aimed at, placed where they can't contaminate. The wording is appropriately non-leading. I especially endorse the Wittgenstein-expert's point about not naming the Essay 7 sentences — whether the reader can recall them is diagnostic.

One small note: the Essay 5 probe ("What did you make of the dreamscape concept?") is adequate but slightly thinner than the others. If there's room, consider: "What did you make of the dreamscape concept? Did the distinction between the two kinds of dreamscape make sense to you?" — this nudges toward the lucid/intoxicated distinction without naming it, which is the core of the Poetic. But this is minor; the current version is fine.

**Revision 8 (Essay 5-6 transition flag):** APPROVE. This is exactly the kind of structural seam we should watch for. The internal-note format is correct — it's for us, not the reader.

**Overall:** Clean synthesis. The architecture is now: uncontaminated reading -> generic experiential reports -> targeted retrospective probes. This mirrors the collection's own structure: phenomena first, frameworks after.
