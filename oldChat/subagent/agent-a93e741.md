*Hybrid: Jing footnoted as *

The author proposes a hybrid solution for the 境/梦境 link:

- 境 stays as **Jing** (romanized, primary term)
- But when first introducing Jing, a footnote glosses it with a "-scape" coinage — something like "living-scape" — establishing that **-scape = 境** in the reader's mind
- Then 梦境 = **"dreamscape"** naturally contains the -scape root, and the reader sees the connection: dream-**scape** contains **-scape** = 境

This way:
- "dreamscape" stays natural and readable (Camp B wins)
- The morphological link is visible (Camp A wins)
- The -scape family works: dreamscape, and any other 境-compounds

Question: Does this work? And what would be the best "-scape" gloss for 境 in the footnote? "Living-scape"? "Experience-scape"? Something else? Brief responses.

This is an elegant solution. \"Jing\" as the primary term preserves the untranslatable density of 境, while the -scape footnote gives English readers a morphological handle that activates every time they encounter \"dreamscape\" or any future -scape compound. The connection becomes subliminal rather than labored.\n\n**Which -scape gloss?** From a philosophy of mind perspective, the gloss should capture what 境 actually IS in the framework: a structured experiential field. My ranking:\n\n1. **\"experiential-scape\"** -- Most accurate to the framework. 境 is defined as a structure on P (experience/phenomena). The \"-scape\" suffix adds the spatial/landscape connotation of a bounded, navigable environment

Sent my recommendation. I endorse the hybrid approach and suggest "experiential-scape" as the footnote gloss -- it is the most philosophically accurate to the framework's definition of 境 as a structured experiential field. I also suggested the footnote mention common Chinese 境-compounds (梦境, 境界, 环境) to show English readers that -scape = 境 is a productive pattern, not ad hoc.
