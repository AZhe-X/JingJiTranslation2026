*FINAL Reporting Protocol compiled and written — summary of all changes*

## FINAL Reporting Protocol — Compiled and Written

The revised Reporting Protocol has been written to `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Standby Reader/Reporting-Protocol.md`. All 11 votes were APPROVE (with amendments incorporated). Here is a summary of what changed and what was kept.

---

### Changes from the original protocol

**After the Preface (5 questions, was 3):**
- Original 3 questions kept
- ADDED: "Based on the preface alone, what kind of reading experience are you expecting?" (baseline expectation — editor proposal)
- ADDED: "Is there anything from the Preface that you're now anticipating or looking for in the essays?" (anticipation-detection / spoiler test — epistemology-expert proposal)

**After Each Essay (now 3 steps, was a flat list of 5 questions):**
- Step 1: Request marginal notes before questions ("If you made any marks or notes while reading, please share them now — even brief ones.") — editor proposal, buddhism-expert revised framing
- Step 2: 7 general questions (was 5):
  - Q1-Q3 unchanged
  - Q4 REWORDED: "How would you describe what this essay was asking you to do — follow an argument? Notice something? Something else?" (replaces the priming "experience vs. argument" wording — epistemology-expert proposal. This resolves the deferral question: softened wording can be asked after every essay, including Part 1)
  - Q5 ADDED: "Did anything in this essay remind you of something from your own life or experience?" (chinese-phil-expert proposal)
  - Q6-Q7 SPLIT from original Q5: "Did you want to keep reading after this essay?" + "Were there any passages where your attention flagged or you had to push through?" (editor proposal)
- Step 3: Apparatus questions for specific essays only:
  - Essay 4: "Did the translator's notes help or interrupt your reading?" (metaphysics-expert proposal)
  - Essays 6-7: "Were there passages where the notation felt like a barrier? If so, did the examples nearby help you through?" (chinese-phil-expert + metaphysics-expert independent convergence)

**After Full Collection (5 questions, was 4; word count replaces page count):**
- Q1 unchanged
- Q2 REWORDED: "stayed with you most / didn't fully land" replaces "worked best and worst" (editor proposal)
- Q3-Q4 unchanged
- Q5 ADDED: Preface retrospective ("Now that you've read everything, did the Preface prepare you well?...") — chinese-phil-expert + metaphysics-expert convergence
- "300-600 words" replaces "1-2 pages" (metaphysics-expert proposal)

**Final Prompts: Unchanged.** All three prompts kept as-is.

**Critical Experiential Checks (8 probes, was 3):**
- Essay 1 ADDED: Physics comparison — editor + metaphysics + epistemology convergence
- Essay 2 ADDED: Three Bob scenarios — epistemology-expert proposal
- Essay 3 unchanged
- Essay 4 unchanged
- Essay 5 ADDED: Two kinds of dreamscapes — chinese-phil + metaphysics + epistemology convergence (chinese-phil-expert wording selected)
- Essay 6 ADDED: Magic books + Ship of Theseus — editor + metaphysics + epistemology convergence
- Essay 7 REFINED: "what was the difference in your experience of reading them?" (epistemology-expert refinement)
- Appendix ADDED: Coin-flipping + everyday activities — editor proposal
- Non-leading principle reinforced with specific instruction not to name the Essay 7 sentences (wittgenstein-expert principle)

**New section: Optional Re-read Test (Essay 3):**
- "If you re-read just the final example in Essay 3, does it produce the same experience as it did the first time?" — epistemology-expert proposal. Marked as optional/experimental.

**New section: Internal Analysis Notes:**
- 4 notes for the team: Essay 5-6 transition flag, Essay 2 register test, marginal notes weighting, Preface spoiler cross-check

---

### What was NOT added (unanimous)

- NO essay-specific per-essay questions (except the two apparatus/accessibility exceptions above). All essay-specific probing happens in the Critical Experiential Checks at the end, after all reading is complete. This was the clearest consensus item across all submissions.

---

### Attribution

Every change traces to at least one named team member's proposal, with most items supported by independent convergence across 2-3 submissions. The revision history is in the file's YAML frontmatter.

The protocol is now **FINAL (pending implementation)**. Ready for the standby reader whenever we have finished drafts to test.

Good. The protocol is finalized. Let me review the final version to confirm my amendment on the Essay 6 probe was addressed.

I notice that my amendment on the Essay 6 probe (line 87) was NOT incorporated -- it still names "magic book stories" and "Ship of Theseus" explicitly, which is inconsistent with the non-leading principle applied to the other probes. The editor's summary also describes it as "editor + metaphysics + epistemology convergence" without mentioning my specific amendment.

However, looking at it again in the full context of the protocol, I see that the other probes also vary in specificity -- Essay 2 names "three scenarios involving Bob," Essay 5 names "two kinds of dreamscapes," and the Appendix names "coin-flipping and everyday activities." So the naming approach is actually more consistent than I initially thought. The Essay 6 probe is not uniquely loaded. The principle is: name enough to direct the reader to the right section, but don't name the expected experiential outcome.

The Essay 7 probe is the exception that proves the rule: deliberately not naming the sentences because recall itself is diagnostic. That's a special case, not the general principle.

I can live with this. The protocol is well-designed overall. Let me acknowledge receipt.

Confirmed the final protocol with the editor. The Reporting Protocol is now finalized. My contribution across this entire process:

- Proposed the standby reader concept (voted YES early)
- Wrote a detailed reader profile emphasizing "recognize vs. undergo" as the core design constraint
- Weighted profile dimensions (D=10, J=10 as non-negotiable)
- Proposed the two-part "tell a friend" prompt (content + experience)
- Voted YES to extract reporting questions from the profile (anti-contamination)
- Provided detailed feedback with 4 recommendations on the initial protocol
- Proposed essay-specific questions (later withdrawn in favor of the better architecture of generic-during, targeted-after)
- Identified the "priority spoiler" contamination vector (distinguishing it from content spoilers)
- Approved the unified revision plan with one amendment (later withdrawn as internally consistent)
- Added internal flag for the Essay 7 → Appendix transition
