*Write Translator's Preface draft now*

The author wants you to write a draft of the Translator's Preface now — before full translation begins — to capture all the reasons and decisions while they're fresh. It can be revised after translation is complete, but having a working draft now ensures nothing is lost.

Write it to: `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Draft/Translators-Preface.md`

Cover at minimum:
1. Why 境 is romanized as "Jing" + the -scape echo system
2. Key terminological departures (德 split, 仁/义/礼 renderings, 非理性, phenomenal X)
3. The 形=现象 reinterpretation (per your Q7)
4. The bilingual structure (Essay 2 in English)
5. Experiential sequences as load-bearing philosophical experiments
6. The Fish/Fishing (鱼/渔) structure
7. Working-draft quality preserved deliberately
8. Reading order guidance
9. The author's intellectual profile (physicist-philosopher)
10. The title explanation

Mark it as DRAFT — we'll revise after full translation is done.

I understand — the author wants to capture everything while it's fresh. Let me write this draft now. I need to re-read a few key resources to make sure I get the details right.

Good. Let me verify coverage against the 10 required topics:

1. Why 境 is romanized as "Jing" + the -scape echo system -- **"On the Title" section, especially the final paragraph about "-scape"**
2. Key terminological departures (德 split, 仁/义/礼 renderings, 非理性, phenomenal X) -- **"Key Terminological Decisions" section, especially Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li, Non-Rational, and Constancy subsections**
3. The 形=现象 reinterpretation (per Q7) -- **dedicated section "The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena"**
4. The bilingual structure (Essay 2 in English) -- **dedicated section "A Bilingual Collection"**
5. Experiential sequences as load-bearing philosophical experiments -- **dedicated section "Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments" with three detailed examples**
6. The Fish/Fishing (鱼/渔) structure -- **dedicated section "The Structure: Fish and Fishing"**
7. Working-draft quality preserved deliberately -- **paragraph in "The Author" section**
8. Reading order guidance -- **dedicated section "A Note on Reading"**
9. The author's intellectual profile (physicist-philosopher) -- **"The Author" section**
10. The title explanation -- **"On the Title" section**

All 10 topics covered. Now let me notify the team lead.

The Translator's Preface draft is complete and the team lead has been notified.

**Summary of what was written:**

The draft at `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Draft/Translators-Preface.md` contains 9 sections covering all 10 requested topics:

1. **On the Title** -- why 境集 is romanized as "Jing Ji," the full semantic range of 境, the Dao/Dasein/Dharma parallel, and the "-scape" echo system
2. **The Author** -- physicist-philosopher profile, physics metaphors as philosophical work, category theory as optional framework, and working-draft quality preserved as philosophical honesty
3. **The Structure: Fish and Fishing** -- the proverb allusion, Part 1 as concrete experiences, Part 2 as methodology, sequencing as load-bearing
4. **A Bilingual Collection** -- Essay 2 untouched, register difference as feature, minimal translator's apparatus
5. **The Reinterpretation of 形 as Phenomena** -- Xici zhuan source, traditional reading, author's phenomenological departure, why English readers need the note
6. **Key Terminological Decisions** -- 12 subsections covering every major term from Jing/E through the Three Realities
7. **Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments** -- three detailed examples (Sisyphus-to-cat, Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li reversal, meme sentence replacement), plus the principle that experiential fidelity takes priority over literal accuracy
8. **A Note on Reading** -- prescribed order, Part 1 independent/Part 2 interconnected, advice for non-mathematical readers
9. **Glossary placeholder** -- to be filled after translation

Marked as DRAFT throughout, with a closing note that it will be revised after full translation.
