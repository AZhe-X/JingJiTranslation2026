*Apply 3 Preface edits, produce DRAFT-R3*

The spoiler resolution plan has been finalized (11/11 consensus). Please apply the following 3 edits to the Translator's Preface and produce DRAFT-R3.

**Edit 1 (Line 46) — in "Fish and Fishing" section:**
FIND: "of feeling the absurd dissolve in the presence of a cat"
REPLACE WITH: "of confronting the absurd through increasingly familiar examples"

**Edit 2 (Line 50) — the structural claims paragraph:**
FIND the entire paragraph starting "Two structural claims of the collection deserve advance notice..." through "...meaning is internally generated."
REPLACE WITH: "The three essays of Part 1 examine, respectively, collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity -- each through a distinctive philosophical method the author does not yet name. The four essays of Part 2 develop the formal framework behind that method: the concepts of the metaphysical, constancy, the poetic, and a categorical formalism for the structure of experience. The relationship between the two parts is itself part of the argument."

**Edit 3 (Lines 95-96) — the Essay 3 example in "Experiential Sequences":**
FIND: "In Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload. By the third example, the reader recognizes -- from their own experience -- that no one who owns a cat has ever felt absurd about it. This recognition, which cannot be produced by argument alone, is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it."
REPLACE WITH: "In Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order, progressing from the mythic to the mundane. The progression itself is the philosophical payload: by the final example, the reader is invited to test the essay's claim against their own experience. The recognition that follows -- which cannot be produced by argument alone -- is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it."

Also update the YAML header: status to DRAFT-R3, note to reflect spoiler resolution. Confirm when done.
