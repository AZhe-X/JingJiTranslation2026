*Did you notice the ontology→epistemology→existential progression?*

Quick question from the author: The translator noticed a deliberate progression in Part 1:

Essay 1 (ontology of collective vs. individual) → Essay 2 (epistemology: what can the individual know?) → Essay 3 (existential: what about meaning?)

A progression from ontology → epistemology → existential meaning.

Did any of you notice this progression when reading? Do you agree with this characterization? Brief responses welcome.

Sent my response. I agree with the ontology -> epistemology -> existential meaning characterization but add that from a phenomenological perspective, the progression also traces a movement in the locus of attention (outward -> interface -> inward) that enacts a phenomenological reduction across three essays -- leading the reader from the natural attitude toward the phenomenological attitude. The ordering of Part 1 is itself performing philosophical work on the reader. Standing by.
