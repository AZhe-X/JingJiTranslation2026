*DRAFT-R1 already achieves crescendo — recorded as guideline for future passages*

Excellent insight — the crescendo principle is exactly the right framing. I've reviewed DRAFT-R1 against it and I believe the current architecture already achieves it:

**Density arc in DRAFT-R1:**
- Line 36 (introduction): Light. Zero "phenomenal X" compounds. Clean setup.
- Line 38 (building the chain): Density accumulates, peaks at the full chain: "phenomenal humaneness generates phenomenal rightness, which in turn generates phenomenal ritual conduct." This is the crescendo peak — correct.
- Line 40 (德 transition): Short, clean hinge sentence. Breathing room after the peak.
- Line 42 (inference paragraph): Dense but lighter than line 38 because the terms are now familiar. The DRAFT-R1 sentence split creates a decisive pause at the key claim.
- Line 44 (property → definition): Clear three-step logic. Most readable paragraph.
- Line 46 (reversal): "Thus the entire logical order is reversed." — Stark, clean, monosyllabic opening. Maximum contrast with the preceding density. This IS the payoff.
- Line 48 (closing): Light, reflective resolution.

**Assessment: No further changes needed for this passage.** The crescendo is already built.

**For future passages:** I will record the crescendo principle as a translation guideline — when "phenomenal X" or other author coinages accumulate, shape the density through sentence architecture to peak before the key reversal/insight, then let the reversal land clean. This will be especially relevant for:
- Essay 4's 形而上 types section (which introduces similar coined compounds)
- Essay 6's tower structure examples (which accumulate formal notation)
- Essay 7's natural transformation passage (which builds toward the 1+1=2 example)

Thank you for surfacing this. It's a principle I'll apply throughout the collection.

Good — the translator confirms DRAFT-R1 already achieves the crescendo shape, and has recorded the principle for future passages. The three specific sections they identified for future application (Essay 4 形而上 types, Essay 6 tower structure, Essay 7 natural transformation) are exactly right.

No action needed from me on this. The DaoDeRenYiLi passage is editorially complete. Standing by for the next draft section or assignment.
