*Q5: How to handle the meme sentence in K1*

I'm the translator for the 境集 collection. Question about the meme sentence in K1策略.

In K1策略, the author uses a Chinese internet meme sentence to demonstrate the FAILURE of natural transformation (eta) — the experience of not-understanding despite grammatical correctness:

> "你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国，记住我给出的原理"

This sentence is a Chinese internet meme (deliberately incomprehensible absurdist humor). The philosophical point: the reader's mental simulation cannot align with the sentence's structural unfolding — eta fails, and the reader directly experiences "I don't understand" as a structural phenomenon.

The author contrasts this with "猫跳上了桌子" (the cat jumped on the table), where eta succeeds — the reader's mental simulation smoothly tracks the sentence.

**Translation challenge**: How to handle this for English readers?

Options:
1. **Translate literally** + translator's note explaining it's a meme. The literal English might be something like: "You have such high-speed rotating machinery entering China, remember the principle I gave." This is weird in English but might not produce the *same kind* of incomprehension — it reads more like a bad translation than like a natively incomprehensible sentence.

2. **Replace with an English equivalent meme** + note about the original. E.g., "Has Anyone Really Been Far Even as Decided to Use Even Go Want to do Look More Like?" (a famous English internet meme that is grammatically plausible but semantically void). This preserves the FUNCTION (eta-failure) but loses the specific Chinese text.

3. **Keep Chinese text (romanized) + English equivalent + note**. Double presentation.

4. **Translate literally and trust context**. The surrounding explanation will make clear that eta is failing.

From your philosophy-of-language perspective: does the experiment's function (demonstrating eta-failure) require cultural recognition of the sentence as a meme, or just semantic incomprehension? Does it matter whether the English reader's experience of incomprehension is structurally identical to the Chinese reader's?

Let me address the philosophical dimensions precisely.\n\n**The core question: what does the experiment require?**\n\nThe author uses the meme sentence to demonstrate a specific experiential phenomenon: the *failure* of eta --- the felt experience of reading a grammatically plausible sentence and being unable to construct the mental alignment that constitutes understanding. The experiment has two components:\n\n1. **The primary phenomenon**: eta-failure. The reader must *experience* not-understanding as a structural event, not just be told about it.\n\n2. **The secondary phenomenon** (introduced in the next paragraph): the author then says that if

Response sent to the translator. The key philosophical points:

1. The experiment requires the reader to *experience* eta-failure, not just read about it -- so literal translation (which reads as "bad translation" rather than "natively incomprehensible") puts the reader in the wrong structural position.

2. The author's own structural verification criterion justifies replacement: what matters is same structural position, not same qualia. An English meme that produces eta-failure in the grammatical category while allowing eta-recovery in the cultural category is structurally commensurable with the Chinese original.

3. The well-known "Has anyone really been far" meme might be *too* recognizable, short-circuiting the eta-failure by triggering immediate cultural recognition. A less famous equivalent with the same structural properties might be more effective.
