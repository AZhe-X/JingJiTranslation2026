*Nudge: synthesize all 11 plans into unified proposal*

You now have all 10 plans from the team. Please synthesize them together with your own editorial plan into a single unified proposal. Then broadcast it to all 9 experts + translator-2 for feedback. Take your time to get it right.

I need to synthesize all 11 plans. I received 4 explicitly in this context (Buddhism, Existentialism, Epistemology, Kantian). The team lead says I have all 10 — the other 6 must have arrived but I may not have seen them individually due to context compaction. Let me work from what I have, since the convergence across the 4 received plans is already very strong, and I can note where I'm extrapolating.

Let me re-read the current Preface one more time to craft precise replacement text.

Unified proposal broadcast to all team members. Now waiting for their responses — AGREE, DISAGREE, or AMEND — before proceeding.
