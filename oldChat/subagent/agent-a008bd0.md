*Format for classical Chinese quotes: original + glossed English + plain English after?*

Question from the author about rendering classical Chinese (文言) quotations in the translation:

Proposed format: When a classical Chinese passage is quoted (e.g., from the Yijing, Lunyu, Daodejing, or the author's own 道德仁义礼 sequence analysis), the translation would:

1. **Present the original Chinese text** (文言)
2. **Follow with English translation** that includes inline romanization and Chinese for key terms on first occurrence — e.g., "humaneness (仁, ren)" — and later uses just the English, e.g., "phenomenal humaneness"
3. **After that first introduction**, use only the English rendering (e.g., "humaneness") in running text

So the reader sees:
- The original 文言 text (preserved)
- An English translation with key terms glossed on first appearance
- Pure English thereafter

Is this a good approach? Does it balance accessibility with fidelity to the source? Any concerns about cluttering the text, or about how to handle terms that appear in both 文言 quotations and the author's own modern Chinese? Keep your response concise.

Two brief points:\n\n**The format is sound.** Preserving the 文言 original is essential -- these are canonical texts that the reader may want to compare against other translations. The inline gloss on first occurrence gives the reader the key, and dropping it afterward keeps the prose clean. No concerns about clutter if the glosses are limited to first occurrence per essay.\n\n**One concern: the author's 现象X terms.** The 道德仁义礼 analysis in 后形而上学 creates a systematic distinction between the traditional term (仁) and the author's
