*经验 and 体验 both *

Follow-up on the 经验 vote. The author (team lead) raises a concern:

If we set 经验 → "experience" as main, then both 经验 AND 体验 have "experience" as their main translation. The full mapping would be:

- 感受 → "feeling" / "felt experience"
- 体验 → "experience"
- 经验 → "experience"
- 感觉 → "sensation"

Two different Chinese terms with the same English main translation. Is this acceptable, or does it create a problem?

If you think it's fine, explain why. If you think it's a problem, what's your solution — should one of them change?

Good — line 205 and 207 are particularly revealing. Let me look at line 250 closely, where both terms appear in the same sentence.

Position sent. The core insight is that English lacks the German Erfahrung/Erlebnis split, so both 经验 and 体验 inevitably map to "experience" — but the author's actual usage patterns (经验 mostly in compounds as a modifier, 体验 mostly as a bare noun) provide a natural disambiguation strategy: 经验 → "experiential" (adjectival) vs 体验 → "experience" (nominal). Standing by.
