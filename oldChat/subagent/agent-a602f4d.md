Quick check: for 道 in the Laozi block quote, do we use "the Way" (Ivanhoe/Lau/Chan standard) or "Dao" (romanized)?

Note: in the author's own analysis, we may use "Dao" as a romanized term. The question is specifically about the block quote.

YES = "the Way" in the block quote
NO = something else (say what)

One word answer.

Same logic as 仁/义/礼 -- consistency with the author's analysis avoids a needless terminological switch. \"Dao\" is standard enough (used by Ivanhoe in some contexts, Moeller, and many contemporary sinologists). The only term that should shift between quote and analysis is 德.",

Voted NO on "the Way" -- use "Dao" in the block quote for consistency. Only 德 (virtue → character) should shift between the classical quotation and the author's analysis. Waiting for further instructions.
