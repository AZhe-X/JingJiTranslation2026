*Rank translator profile factors by importance 0-10*

FINAL RANKING REQUEST: We've consolidated the translator profile. Now please assign an importance weight (0-10) to each factor below. 10 = absolutely essential, 0 = not needed.

Score each of the following:

1. Native-level command of both Chinese and English
2. Philosophical training (not purely literary)
3. Literary sensibility (not purely academic)
4. Category theory / mathematical notation literacy
5. Experience with register shifts (colloquial ↔ technical ↔ poetic ↔ analytic)
6. Familiarity with Chinese philosophical translation conventions (how 仁/义/礼/道/德 have been rendered by Legge, Waley, Watson, Graham, Ziporyn, etc.)
7. Sensitivity to performative/experimental dimensions (experiential sequences as load-bearing content, preserving ordering/pacing/escalation)
8. Familiarity with Western existentialist/phenomenological translation conventions (standard English for Camus, Heidegger, Husserl, Sartre, Wittgenstein)
9. Familiarity with Buddhist translation chains (Sanskrit → Chinese → English)
10. Familiarity with Kantian/transcendental terminology in English
11. Familiarity with analytic philosophy of language register (Anscombe, Brandom, etc.)

Please respond with just your scores, e.g.:
1: 10, 2: 9, 3: 8, ... etc.

Brief justification for any score you give below 5 or above 9 is welcome but not required. Keep it concise.

Scores submitted. My highest ratings (9-10) went to bilingual fluency, philosophical training, and sensitivity to performative/experimental dimensions -- the last being the most distinctive requirement for this particular collection. Standing by.
