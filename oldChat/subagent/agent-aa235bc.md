*Did you notice the ontology→epistemology→existential progression?*

Quick question from the author: The translator noticed a deliberate progression in Part 1:

Essay 1 (ontology of collective vs. individual) → Essay 2 (epistemology: what can the individual know?) → Essay 3 (existential: what about meaning?)

A progression from ontology → epistemology → existential meaning.

Did any of you notice this progression when reading? Do you agree with this characterization? Brief responses welcome.

Response sent. I confirmed the ontology -> epistemology -> existential progression and added a Wittgensteinian observation: the sequence also functions as a **therapeutic progression**, where each essay dissolves the confusion that the previous essay's conclusion might naturally provoke --- structurally identical to how Wittgenstein sequences remarks in the *Investigations*. This further reinforces that the essay ordering is load-bearing for translation.
