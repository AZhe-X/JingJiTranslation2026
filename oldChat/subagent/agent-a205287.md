*形而上 etymology lost in translation — problem?*

The author just noticed something about the sentence: 因此，道既是最上者，是为形而上，而礼既是最下者，是为形。

The Chinese word 形而上 (metaphysical) literally contains:
- 形 (xing) = form/phenomena
- 而上 = "and above"

So 形而上 literally means "above the phenomenal/formal." The author's sentence exploits this internal structure: 道 is the HIGHEST (最上者), and is 形而上 (above form); 礼 is the LOWEST (最下者), and is 形 (form itself).

The English "metaphysical" loses this entirely — the reader cannot see that "metaphysical" literally means "above the phenomenal" or that "the phenomenal" (形) is embedded inside the word "metaphysical" (形而上).

Current translation: "Thus the Way is the highest — it is the metaphysical — while ritual conduct is the lowest — it is the phenomenal."

Questions:
1. Is losing this etymological wordplay a big problem for the reader's understanding of the passage?
2. If so, should we add a TN explaining the 形/形而上 structure?
3. Or is there a way to render it in English that preserves the relationship (e.g., "above-the-phenomenal" for 形而上)?

Brief responses.

What's lost is the structural elegance: the reader can't see that the word for \"metaphysical\" literally contains and surpasses the word for \"phenomenal.\" That's not just wordplay — it's the argument performing itself at the lexical level. The containment relation (形 inside 形而上) mirrors the philosophical claim (the phenomenal is subsumed within the metaphysical).\n\n2. Yes, a TN is warranted here.

Recommended keeping the current translation ("the metaphysical" / "the phenomenal") and adding a TN that reveals the structural relationship: 形 (form/phenomenal) is literally contained inside 形而上 (above form/metaphysical), mirroring the philosophical claim. No hyphenated neologisms in running text — let the TN do the explanatory work.
