*AMEND: restore three cases in Edit 3; AGREE on everything else*

**Vote: AMEND** — one specific change to Edit 3, otherwise AGREE on everything.

### The amendment

**Edit 3 (lines 95-96):** I agree with removing the punchline and the mechanism. But I would restore the three specific cases:

**Editor's proposed:**
"In Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order, progressing from the mythic to the mundane. The progression itself is the philosophical payload: by the final example, the reader is invited to test the essay's claim against their own lived experience. The recognition that follows -- which cannot be produced by argument alone -- is the essay's central philosophical move. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it."

**My amendment:**
"In Essay 3, the author arranges three cases of repetitive, apparently meaningless labor in a specific order: Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to an alienating job, a cat owner cleaning the litter box. The progression from mythic to mundane is the philosophical payload — the final example is designed to produce a recognition that the reader must encounter firsthand. The sequence cannot be rearranged, summarized, or abstracted without destroying it."

**Rationale:** 

1. The essay is titled "Sisyphus, Work, and Cats" (西西弗斯、班与猫). The reader already knows these three figures from the table of contents. Removing them from the Preface does not protect them — it just makes the Preface less concrete.

2. The Experiential Sequences section is arguing that the Preface should be trusted when it says "these sequences matter." The argument is stronger with concrete examples than with abstractions like "progressing from the mythic to the mundane." The reader needs to *see* the progression (Sisyphus → office worker → cat owner) to understand what kind of sequence they're being told to respect.

3. The spoiler is not in the three cases — it's in the *recognition* that follows from experiencing them in order. Naming the cases is structural; stating the recognition is the spoiler. My version names the cases but withholds the recognition entirely ("a recognition that the reader must encounter firsthand").

4. On a practical note: "the reader is invited to test the essay's claim against their own lived experience" contains the phrase "lived experience," which we have established should be avoided per the Translation Dictionary ("too Husserlian"). My version avoids it.

### Everything else: AGREE

- **Edit 1 (line 46):** Good. "Confronting the absurd through increasingly familiar examples" names the method without the outcome. I slightly prefer your version to mine here — it's more evocative.
- **Edit 2 (line 50):** Excellent. The full replacement is cleaner than my partial salvage. "The relationship between the two parts is itself part of the argument" is the best sentence in the revision.
- **Edits 4-5:** Agreed, no changes.
- **Afterword structure:** Agree with all five sections, the 3,000-4,000 word range, the tone, and the placement. Section B (cross-traditional connections) will be the Afterword's distinctive contribution and deserves the longest treatment.
- **Process:** Agree. Preface edits now → DRAFT-R3; Afterword drafted later after more translation is complete.

Translator-2 AMENDs on Edit 3 — wants to restore the specific listing of the three cases while keeping the punchline removed. This is the same position the Chinese-phil expert originally held. The arguments are substantive:

1. The essay title already reveals the three figures
2. Concrete examples make the Experiential Sequences section's argument stronger
3. The spoiler is the recognition, not the cases
4. "Lived experience" should be avoided per Translation Dictionary

Point 4 is already addressed in my confirmation to the team lead — I already noted translator-2's "lived experience" -> "experience" fix. But the question of whether to list the three cases is a real editorial judgment call.

Current votes on listing the three cases:
- REMOVE listing: Editor (me), Buddhism, Existentialism, Epistemology, Kantian, Phenomenology, Wittgenstein, Phil-mind, Metaphysics (9)
- KEEP listing: Chinese-phil, Translator-2 (2)

The majority is clear (9 vs 2). But translator-2's argument about the essay title is pragmatically strong — the reader will see "Sisyphus, Work, and Cats" in the table of contents regardless.

Let me respond and note this as registered dissent while incorporating the "lived experience" fix.

However, the current majority is 9-2 in favor of removing the listing. The majority view is that even though the essay title names the figures, the Preface listing them in sequence with the mythic-to-mundane framing slightly pre-structures the reader's encounter in a way the bare title does not.\n\nIs this a **blocking obje
