*Vote on Foreword — yes/no/optional, with reasons*

ALL TEAM MEMBERS (experts, translator-2, editor):

Vote: **Should this collection include a Foreword?**

Reminder: A Foreword is written by someone other than the author or translator — typically a scholar, philosopher, or expert who can position the work for the reader. The Translator's Preface (DRAFT-R2) is already done and confirmed.

The question is: in addition to the Translator's Preface, should there be a Foreword?

Options:
- **YES** — include a Foreword
- **NO** — Translator's Preface is sufficient
- **OPTIONAL** — nice to have but not necessary

Please vote AND give a brief reason (1-2 sentences). Everyone votes.

  "content": "OPTIONAL — A Foreword by a recognized scholar would help position the work for anglophone readers unfamiliar with the author, especially since the collection bridges analytic philosophy of mind, phenomenology, Chinese philosophy, and category theory in an unusual way — a foreword writer could signal to readers from any of these traditions that the text merits serious engagement. However, the Translator's Preface already does strong framing work, and finding a scholar with genuine command of all these domains who can write an honest foreword (rather than a perfunctory endorsement) is a high bar. A weak foreword would hurt more than no foreword.",

Voted **OPTIONAL** on the Foreword — it would be valuable if the right scholar can be found, but a weak foreword would do more harm than good, and the Translator's Preface already provides strong framing. Awaiting next task.
