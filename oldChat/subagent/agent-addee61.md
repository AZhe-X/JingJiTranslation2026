*AGREE with one amendment on phenomenology specifics in Afterword*

**AGREE** — with one small amendment.

The proposal is excellent. The three Preface edits are precisely right, and the Afterword structure is well-proportioned. I have one domain-specific amendment:

**AMEND: Section B, Phenomenological connections (~2 sentences of additional specificity)**

The current outline lists "Phenomena as starting point (cf. Husserl's Lebenswelt). The relationship between Jing and intentional constitution. Departures from Heidegger's ontological project." This is correct but could be more precise about what the Afterword should cover. I suggest the outline explicitly include:

- The tower structure (塔式结构) as the formal expression of the infinite iterability of phenomenological reflection — this is the framework's most direct formalization of a Husserlian insight and deserves specific mention.
- The eta/natural transformation as a formalization of Husserl's concept of fulfilled intention (erfullte Intention) — when eta is identity, meaning-intention is perfectly filled. This connects the phenomenological tradition to the author's formal apparatus in a way that would be immediately recognizable to phenomenologists.
- The author's 第一实在 as pre-categorical (closer to Husserl's "manifold of intuition" before synthesis than to Kant's already-constituted Erscheinung) — this distinction matters for correctly positioning the work vis-a-vis both traditions.

These are not new claims — they are already in my Analysis Report — but flagging them in the Afterword outline ensures the writer knows to include them. Without these specifics, the phenomenological connections section risks being too general ("the author is like Husserl") rather than showing exactly where the formal apparatus maps onto phenomenological structures and where it departs.

Everything else — the Preface edits, the Afterword structure, the tone, the length, the placement, the process — I fully endorse.
