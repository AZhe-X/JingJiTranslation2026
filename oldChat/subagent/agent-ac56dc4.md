*Renaming realities: Ultimate/Secondary instead of First/Second?*

The author is considering an alternative numbering/naming scheme for the three realities. Currently the dictionary has:

- 第〇实在 → Zeroth Reality
- 第一实在 → First Reality  
- 第二实在 → Second Reality

The author's proposal:

- 第〇实在 → **Zeroth Reality** (with TN: "Ultimate Reality")
- 第一实在 → **Ultimate Reality** (with TN: "First Reality" in the original)
- 第二实在 → **Secondary Reality** (with TN: "Second Reality" in the original)

So the proposal promotes 第一实在 from "First" to "Ultimate" and demotes 第二实在 from "Second" to "Secondary." 第〇实在 keeps "Zeroth" but gets a TN linking it to "Ultimate Reality" in traditional metaphysics.

Is this a good idea? Does renaming 第一实在 as "Ultimate Reality" better capture its role (phenomena as the indubitable ground)? Or does it create confusion — since the author explicitly says (footnote 25) that 第一实在 is a *name* (名称), not an ontological claim about what is "most real"? And does calling 第二实在 "Secondary" imply it is lesser/derivative in a way the author may not intend?

Keep your response concise — yes/no with brief reasoning.

Strong no on the renaming. "Ultimate Reality" is the most heavily claimed term in Buddhist-Western comparative philosophy (= *paramartha-satya*), and using it for 第一実在 would directly contradict the author's footnote 25 disclaiming ontological hierarchy. The ordinal numbering encodes epistemic access order, not a reality ranking -- qualitative names like "Ultimate" and "Secondary" corrupt this neutrality. Standing by.
