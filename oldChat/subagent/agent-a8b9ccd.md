*Swap 道德仁义礼 for Western example?*

The author asks: should we swap the 道德仁义礼 example entirely for a more Western metaphysics example? The thinking is that if 德 requires this much translation apparatus (constitutive character, TNs, glosses, etc.), maybe the whole passage would work better with a Western example that English readers already understand — and keep the Chinese example only in a TN or appendix.

What do you think? Is this a good idea or a bad idea? Brief response.

It is one passage in one essay, with five terms that each need one gloss at first occurrence.

Sent my response: strongly against swapping the example. The 道德仁义礼 sequence is the argument itself, not a detachable illustration, and the translation difficulty is front-loaded and manageable.
