*AGREE — withdraw line 50 preference, accept unified proposal*

**AGREE** — accepting the unified proposal as-is.

On reflection, the editor's replacement paragraph is better than a partial save. The nihilism-as-consequence sentence, even though it is more of a framing claim than an experiential payoff, still pre-interprets the relationship between Essays 4 and 5 in a way that the reader could discover on their own. The replacement ("The three essays of Part 1 examine, respectively, collective interest, knowledge, and absurdity...") achieves the same orienting function more cleanly. I withdraw my preference for keeping the first sentence.

Good. The Wittgenstein expert formally withdraws their line 50 preference and AGREES with the unified proposal as-is. This resolves one of the two minority positions on Edit 2 — now only Translator-2 had the hybrid preference, and they already AGREED on Edit 2 in their formal response (their AMEND was only on Edit 3's case listing).

**All formal responses now in. Status:**

- **11/11 AGREE on Edits 1, 2, and 5** (unanimous)
- **8/11 AGREE on Edit 4 (line 97 as-is)** — 3 minority dissent (Metaphysics, Phil-mind, Chinese-phil), awaiting blocking/dissent clarification from Metaphysics
- **9/11 AGREE on Edit 3 as proposed** — 2 minority dissent (Chinese-phil, Translator-2), awaiting blocking/dissent clarification from Translator-2
- **Afterword blueprint: unanimous AGREE** with accepted amendments from 6 experts

Team lead has confirmed 10/10 consensus. Awaiting go-ahead to apply edits.
