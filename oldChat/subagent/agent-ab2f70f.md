*Q4: Is *

I'm the translator for the 境集 collection. I have two questions for you — Q4 (梦境 rendering) and Q6 (虚妄 rendering). I'll ask Q4 first.

**Q4: Is "dreamscape" the right rendering for 梦境 (mengjing)?**

Context: 梦境 is the author's initial metaphorical name for what later becomes the technical concept 境 (Jing/E). It means a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible — NOT literal dreaming. The author explicitly says 梦境 includes games, books, rituals, relationships, life-projects. The 沉醉/清醒 (intoxicated/lucid) distinction plays on the lucid dreaming metaphor.

Your analysis report made the important connection to the Diamond Sutra's dream metaphor (一切有为法，如梦幻泡影) and noted that this is NOT a call to disengage — the bodhisattva continues practicing while knowing all conditioned phenomena are dreamlike.

My question: Does "dreamscape" adequately preserve the Buddhist resonance? Or does it carry too much English-language fantasy/surreal connotation (Salvador Dali, film dream sequences)?

Alternatives:
1. **"dreamscape"** — natural English, poetic, preserves dream metaphor
2. **"dream-realm"** — more Chinese-philosophical register (cf. 仙境 = immortal realm)
3. **"dream-sphere"** — echoes Sloterdijk
4. **"experiential milieu"** — descriptive, loses dream metaphor entirely

Specifically: does the Diamond Sutra connection favor one rendering over another? The author's point is that we inhabit meaning-environments *like* dreams — constructed, immersive, functional within their own terms — not that they ARE dreams in the literal sense.

Recommendation sent to the translator: **"dreamscape" is correct**. Key reasons:

- The Diamond Sutra's dream simile (*svapna*) is about structural properties (immersive, functional, not inherently grounded) -- "dreamscape" preserves this
- "-scape" signals constructed environment, connecting to the author's central concept 境
- "Dream-realm" carries unwanted Buddhist cosmological baggage (*loka*, *dhatu*)
- "Experiential milieu" is accurate but experientially dead -- like translating 如夢幻泡影 as "lacking inherent existence"
- The Dali/surreal worry is contextually controlled within a paragraph

Waiting for Q6 on 虚妄. Standing by.
