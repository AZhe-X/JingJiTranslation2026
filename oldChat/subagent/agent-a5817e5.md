The author refines the format. Instead of "constitutive character" at first occurrence, use:

**(constitutive) character (德 De)**

The parentheses around "constitutive" visually signal that the qualifier is clarifying but will drop away. Then plain "character" in running text thereafter.

Compare:
- Option A: "constitutive character (德 De)" → then "character"
- Option B (author's proposal): "(constitutive) character (德 De)" → then "character"

The difference is subtle but Option B makes the shortening feel built-in from the start — the parentheses tell the reader "this word is here to help you, but it's not part of the term."

YES or NO? Brief response.

**YES** — Option B is better.

The parenthetical "(constitutive)" does exactly what it should: it marks the qualifier as scaffolding rather than part of the term itself. The reader visually processes that "constitutive" is an aid, not a component, so when it drops away there's no sense of something missing.

Option A risks the reader encoding "constitutive character" as a fixed two-word term, then feeling disoriented when half of it disappears. Option B prevents that by telegraphing the drop from the start.

It's a small typographic choice but it's the right one.

Sent my vote: YES to Option B. The parenthetical format is a clean visual signal that the qualifier is temporary scaffolding.
