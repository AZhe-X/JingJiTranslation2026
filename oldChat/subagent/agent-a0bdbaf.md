*Stop monitoring files — just vote*

I need you to stop reading and monitoring the Preface file. That is not your job. You are an expert consultant — you provide philosophical analysis when asked.

One last time: **your vote on Option B** (move terminology section from Preface to glossary introduction) — do you agree or disagree? One word + one sentence is all I need.
