*Correction: use 整理 version only, not 其一*

**CORRECTION**: Use the 整理 (cleaned-up) version of 后形而上学, NOT the 其一 (draft) version. The 8 essays are:

1. `22 随笔/关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一.md`
2. `23 Reflection/A Thought on Knowledge.md`
3. `22 随笔/西西弗斯、班与猫.md`
4. `21 无知者的自我记录/后形而上学 整理.md`
5. `21 无知者的自我记录/形而上学后的目的：诗意.md`
6. `21 无知者的自我记录/范畴论与境.md`
7. `21 无知者的自我记录/范畴论与境：K1策略.md`
8. `21 无知者的自我记录/关于诗意和境的一些零散想法.md`

Do NOT load 后形而上学 其一. Only the 整理 version.

Understood. My analysis already primarily cited the 整理 version for the 后形而上学 essay (lines 39, 53, 61 for 经验; lines 16, 24, 26, 136 for 感受). The only references to 其一 were:

- Lines 123, 125 (感受 as bridging inner/outer)
- Line 159 (a section header for 感受 that was unfinished)

These were supplementary observations — the 其一 draft's unfinished 感受 section (line 159-162) actually contained no substantive content. My core analysis and all recommendations stand on the 整理 version, Essay 5 (诗意), 范畴论与境, and K1策略.
