*Two optional follow-ups: intersubjectivity via η, essays as philosophical experiments*

Two follow-up items from the author for you to consider. These are optional — only engage if you find them relevant to your field. If not, you can skip.

1. **Intersubjectivity (主体间性)**: If you have open questions about how intersubjectivity works in this framework, the author suggests looking at the natural transformation (自然变换) section in K1策略. The natural transformation η may be the mechanism through which intersubjective verification is possible — if two people share the same structural alignment (same η), their understanding is commensurable even without sharing qualia. Consider whether this resolves or reframes the intersubjectivity problem from your field's perspective.

2. **Philosophical Experiment (哲学实验)**: The author proposes "philosophical experiments" — constructing examples to awaken specific experiences in readers, then checking if those experiences are replicable. The author suggests that many parts of the essays THEMSELVES are philosophical experiments (not just descriptions of philosophy, but actual experiments being conducted on the reader). Re-read the essays with this lens: which specific passages function as philosophical experiments? Is the Sisyphus/cat essay itself an experiment in dissolving absurdity? Is the 道德仁义礼 reversal an experiment in restructuring the reader's 境?

If you have thoughts on either of these, please share. If not, no need to respond.

These are both directly relevant to phenomenology. Let me re-examine the relevant passages with these lenses before responding.

Sent my extended analysis on both follow-up topics. Key points:

**On intersubjectivity via eta:** The natural transformation framework genuinely resolves the phenomenological intersubjectivity problem by shifting from content-based (do we share the same qualia?) to structure-based (do we share the same structural alignment?). This improves on Husserl's appresentation and formalizes Merleau-Ponty's intercorporeality. One remaining tension: the bootstrapping problem of how shared formal media are constituted in the first place.

**On essays as philosophical experiments:** I identified six specific passages that function as experiments -- the Sisyphus/cat three-stage design, the 道德仁义礼 reversal (which induces a mini-epoche in the reader), the 1+1=2 eta verification, the Ship of Theseus introspection, the coin-toss as 诗意 demonstration, and the meta-experiment of re-reading the earlier essay. The critical translation implication: these passages are *functional*, not merely illustrative, and must preserve their concrete experiential texture.

Standing by for further instructions.
