*Swap 道德仁义礼 for Western example?*

The author asks: should we swap the 道德仁义礼 example entirely for a more Western metaphysics example? The thinking is that if 德 requires this much translation apparatus (constitutive character, TNs, glosses, etc.), maybe the whole passage would work better with a Western example that English readers already understand — and keep the Chinese example only in a TN or appendix.

What do you think? Is this a good idea or a bad idea? Brief response.

Bad idea. The 道德仁义礼 passage is not a replaceable illustration -- it is a philosophical experiment that performs the top-down/bottom-up reversal on the reader through the specific mechanics of those terms. Swapping in Western equivalents would break the experimental apparatus. The glossing cost is one-time and the passage is short; the apparatus pays for itself.
