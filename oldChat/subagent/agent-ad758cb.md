*前形而上学: *

The author raises a concern about 前形而上学 (qian xing er shang xue):

Current translation: "pre-metaphysics"

Problem: In English, "pre-metaphysics" sounds like "before metaphysics" — as if referring to a period before metaphysics existed. But the author's meaning is "metaphysics before nihilism" — the entire tradition from Thales through Hegel, from the Yijing through Neo-Confucianism. It IS metaphysics, just the kind done before the nihilistic crisis.

Similarly, 后形而上学 = "post-metaphysics" works better because it clearly means "after [the crisis of] metaphysics." But 前形而上学 as "pre-metaphysics" is misleading.

What's a better rendering? Some options to consider:
- "pre-nihilist metaphysics" (already listed as alternative from Chinese Philosophy expert)
- "classical metaphysics"
- "traditional metaphysics" (the author's own gloss)
- "pre-critical metaphysics" (Kantian resonance)
- Something else?

Keep your response concise — what's your recommendation and why?

In English philosophical usage, \"traditional\" is often used dismissively (\"traditional metaphysics\" = the stuff we have moved past). It also fails to specify *what event* marks the boundary.
