*Debate *

The author wants to discuss chinese-phil-expert's proposal: "constitutive nature" for 德.

Chinese-phil-expert's argument was:
- "Constitutive" means "having the power to establish or compose" — neutral on whether innate or constructed
- "Nature" captures "what-it-is-ness" without moral baggage
- Has philosophical pedigree across Kant (constitutive vs. regulative), phenomenology (constitutive analysis), and philosophy of science
- Maps well to the author's constructivist usage: 德 is the constitutive principle that emerges from bottom-up assembly of phenomena

Those who voted differently: what is your specific objection to "constitutive nature"? And chinese-phil-expert: defend it against the main counterarguments (too heavy for running text? "nature" collides with 性?)

Brief responses please — focus on the strongest objection or defense.

Good -- 性 appears in this essay only as part of compounds like 非理性 (non-rational), 理性 (rational), 目的性 (purposiveness), 功能性 (functionality), 恒常性 (constancy). The author does not use standalone 性 (xing, nature) as a philosophical term in this essay. Let me also quickly check if 性 appears as a standalone term elsewhere in the collection.

Just a section heading with no content -- a placeholder. Good, 性 (xing/nature) is not a live term in this collection.

  "content": "I concede that \"constitutive nature\" is a strong option. My strongest objection and then my honest assessment:\n\n**The objection: two-word terms are costly in running text.**\n\nEvery time 德 appears, the reader encounters \"constitutive nature\" -- a four-syllable, two-word phrase. In the 道-德-仁-义-礼 passage, which is already dense, this adds weight:\n\n- \"Dao generates constitutive nature; the constitutive nature of a person is humaneness...\"\n- vs. \"Dao generates De; the De of a person is humaneness...\"\n\nThe passage involves five terms in rapid sequence. Four of them (Dao, Ren, Yi, Li) are monosyllabic romanizations. Replacing the fifth with a bisyllabic phrase breaks the rhythmic parallelism. The Chinese reads 道-德-仁
