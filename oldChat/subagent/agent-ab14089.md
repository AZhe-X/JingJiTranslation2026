*Translation sequence assigned: Essay 4 revision, then Essay 3, then Essay 1*

Here is your translation sequence. Three tasks have been created:

**Task #29 (immediate): Revise Essay 4 Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li passage per editorial flags.**
The editor reviewed the draft and identified 3 priority flags and 3 minor flags. The full review is at:
`/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Editor/Review-Essay4-DaoDeRenYiLi.md`

Priority items:
1. Use em dashes instead of parentheses in line 38's culminating sentence for breathing room
2. Consider splitting the 46-word subordinate clause in line 42 at "because" — the key claim about self/other experience is buried
3. Fix emphasis on line 44: "**what a *person* is**" (bold + italic on "person")

Minor items (your judgment): awkward "run from first to last" phrasing, flat-landing "it is the phenomenal," "is said to be" vs "means" in footnote 3.

**Task #30 (next): Draft full Essay 3 translation (Sisyphus, Work, and Cats).**
This is the highest-priority new essay because its experiential sequence (Sisyphus -> office worker -> cat) is the most critical to test with the standby reader. See your memo and the editor's memo for detailed requirements. Output to `Draft/Essay3-SisyphusWorkCats.md`.

**Task #31 (after #30): Draft full Essay 1 translation (Collective Interest).**

The overall translation sequence will be: finish Essay 4 passage revision -> Essay 3 -> Essay 1 -> complete remaining Essay 4 -> Essay 5 -> Essays 6-7 -> Essay 2 apparatus -> Essay 8.

Please start with Task #29 now.

Task #29 is already completed — I reviewed all 6 editorial flags and found that priority flags 1-3 and minor flag 4 were already applied in the current draft. Minor flags 5-6 I reviewed and kept as-is by translator judgment. I reported this earlier.

Task #30 (Essay 3) is also complete — I have the full draft ready but file write was denied. I sent the complete text to the team lead for writing.

However, the team lead told me to stand by and go idle. I'm holding until I hear from the team lead before proceeding with Task #31 or anything else.
