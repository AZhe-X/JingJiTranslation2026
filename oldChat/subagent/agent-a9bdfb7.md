The parentheses decision (keeping (**can**)/(**should**) to mirror the author's Chinese typographic choice) is well-reasoned. The argument's logical structure, the 解释 pivot, the property-to-definition reversal, and the 德 shift are all faithfully preserved. Ready for final.",

**CONFIRM** sent. The revised draft is approved -- all key recommendations were addressed, the one declined change (parentheses) has sound justification, and the argument's logical architecture is faithfully preserved. Standing by for further tasks.
