*List all files in your context*

Context audit. List EVERY file you have loaded in your context right now. For each file, state:
- Full file path
- Whose file it is (which agent's workspace)

Be thorough — list everything, including memos, reports, profiles, drafts, essays, dictionaries, anything.
