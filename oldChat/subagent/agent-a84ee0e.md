*Hybrid: Jing footnoted as *

The author proposes a hybrid solution for the 境/梦境 link:

- 境 stays as **Jing** (romanized, primary term)
- But when first introducing Jing, a footnote glosses it with a "-scape" coinage — something like "living-scape" — establishing that **-scape = 境** in the reader's mind
- Then 梦境 = **"dreamscape"** naturally contains the -scape root, and the reader sees the connection: dream-**scape** contains **-scape** = 境

This way:
- "dreamscape" stays natural and readable (Camp B wins)
- The morphological link is visible (Camp A wins)
- The -scape family works: dreamscape, and any other 境-compounds

Question: Does this work? And what would be the best "-scape" gloss for 境 in the footnote? "Living-scape"? "Experience-scape"? Something else? Brief responses.

The -scape suffix in English already carries the right connotations: landscape, seascape, mindscape, soundscape -- all mean \"the structured appearance of X as experienced from a standpoint.\" This is remarkably close to what 境 means for the author. The suffix naturally decomposes into [domain]-scape, just as Chinese compounds decompose into [modifier]-境.\n\nThe reader who learns \"Jing = -scape\" in a footnote will then automatically parse:\n- dreamscape = dream-境 (correct)\n- and potentially: mindscape, soundscape, etc. as analogies for other kinds of 境\n\nThis preserv

Sent my assessment. The hybrid works well. Key points:

- The -scape suffix already carries the right connotations (structured appearance from a standpoint)
- Do NOT coin a compound like "living-scape" for bare 境 -- let "Jing" stand alone with -scape as its echo in compounds
- The footnote should establish the equivalence abstractly rather than through a specific compound
- Caution: -scape works for the author's technical 境 and 梦境, but traditional compounds like 境界 (used in their traditional "bounds/limits" sense) should keep traditional renderings
