*All 4 suggestions already applied, confirming current draft*

Thank you for the detailed review. All 4 of your recommended changes have already been addressed in the current draft:

1. **"Feeling of concern"** — Already changed to "a feeling directed toward the other" per the phenomenology expert's earlier review, which made the same point about preserving the author's deliberate generality regarding 对他人感受.

2. **套用 → "imposed...onto"** — Already changed. Both you and the Wittgenstein expert flagged this independently. "Imposed" captures the template-forcing quality of 套用 and the epistemic overreach in the other-minds argument.

3. **发乎于心 consistency** — Already standardized. All three occurrences (lines 38, 42, 46) now read "from within the heart," anchoring the first-person interiority as you recommend.

4. **"Righteousness" in block quote** — Overruled by the earlier 9-1 team vote. Noted that you defer.

Your confirmations on the 切实/actually pattern, the 推动力/motivation rendering, the property→definition reversal, and footnote [^4] as the crux of the other-minds problem are all helpful validation. The draft stands with all your input incorporated.

Nothing further from me on this passage.",
