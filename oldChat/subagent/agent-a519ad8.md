*Check 境界 occurrences in source texts — traditional or technical?*

Follow-up question from the author on 境界: Since 境界 also contains 境, we need to check whether the -scape link should apply here too, or whether 境界 is used in its traditional sense (boundary/realm/level of attainment).

Could you check where 境界 actually appears in the original essays and assess: is the author using 境界 in a way that connects to the technical concept 境, or in its traditional/conventional sense? Does the 境 inside 境界 matter the same way the 境 inside 梦境 matters?

The source texts are at:
/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/21 无知者的自我记录/
/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/20 文章/22 随笔/

Please check the actual occurrences and give your assessment. Brief responses welcome.
