*Hybrid: *

Follow-up from the author on 前形而上学:

Proposed compromise: **"traditional metaphysics"** as the main translation, with a TN on first occurrence glossing it as **"pre-nihilist metaphysics"** — i.e., metaphysics as practiced before the nihilistic crisis.

This way:
- Main text uses the author's own gloss ("traditional metaphysics") — natural, accessible
- TN specifies the actual dividing line: "pre-nihilist" — so the reader knows what "traditional" is relative to
- The structural pairing with 后形而上学 ("post-metaphysics") is preserved in the main text, and the TN makes the nihilism connection explicit

Does this hybrid work? Concise yes/no + brief reasoning.

The reader does not stumble on it. The TN then sharpens the meaning: \"traditional\" here means specifically \"pre-nihilist,\" i.e., the dividing line is the nihilistic crisis, not Kant's critique, not the linguistic turn, not Habermas's intersubjective turn.\n\nThe only thing I would add to the TN is the author's own words: \"是我创造出来的一个名词\" -- \"this is a term I coined.\" This signals to the reader that 前形而上学 / \"traditional metaphysics\" is
