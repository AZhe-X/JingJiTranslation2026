*Standard translations all use *

New data for the 德 discussion. The passage 故失道而后德，失德而后仁，失仁而后义，失义而后礼 (Dao De Jing Ch. 38) has well-established standard English translations:

**D.C. Lau**: "When the way was lost there was virtue; when virtue was lost there was benevolence; when benevolence was lost there was rectitude; when rectitude was lost there were the rites."

**Wing-tsit Chan**: "When the Way is lost, only then do we have virtue; when virtue is lost, only then do we have humanity; when humanity is lost, only then do we have righteousness; when righteousness is lost, only then do we have propriety."

**James Legge**: "When the Tao was lost, its attributes appeared; when its attributes were lost, benevolence appeared; when benevolence was lost, righteousness appeared; when righteousness was lost, the proprieties appeared."

Every major translator uses "virtue" for 德 in this passage. Our decision was "(constitutive) character" instead.

Given this data — does this change your view? Should we:
A) Keep "(constitutive) character" — our reasoned departure from tradition, acknowledged in TN
B) Use the standard "virtue" for the Laozi block quote specifically (since it IS a quotation of a classical text), then switch to "(constitutive) character" when the author begins their own analysis
C) Something else?

Brief response with your recommendation.

The Laozi quote is someone else's text. Using an established translation (Lau or Chan) respects the source and gives the reader a recognizable anchor. A reader who has encountered DDJ Ch. 38 before will recognize it; using \"character\" would make a familiar passage unrecognizable.\n\n2. The switch from \"virtue\" to \"character\" is itself philosophically meaningful. It performs the author's argument: the traditional framework uses 德 as \"virtue\" (moral, top-down, normative), but the author's analysis reveals that 德 actually functions as \"character\" (c

Option B. "Virtue" in the Laozi block quote (respecting the established translation tradition), then switch to "(constitutive) character" when the author begins their own analysis. The terminological shift in English performs the author's own conceptual shift -- the reader watches "virtue" get reinterpreted as "character" in real time, which is exactly what the essay argues.
