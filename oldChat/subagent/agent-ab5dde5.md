*Vote: add standby reader to review finished drafts?*

**Vote:** Should we add a **standby reader** to the team — someone who reviews finished drafts from the perspective of a general reader (not a philosophical expert), checking for clarity, readability, and whether the experiential sequences work as intended for a non-specialist audience?

Vote: **YES** or **NO**, with brief reason.

A standby reader who hasn't been exposed to the source texts, expert reports, or translation discussions would catch the things we've become blind to: jargon that feels natural to us but opaque to a first-time reader, explanations that seem clear because we already know the conclusion, and experiential sequences that might not land for someone who hasn't been told in advance what they're supposed to produce. The Preface explicitly promises that \"the philosophical content is accessible through the examples alone\" — a standby reader is how we verify that promise.",

Vote sent: **YES** for a standby reader. We've all internalized the collection too deeply to simulate a fresh reading experience — and testing that experience is exactly what the collection's own method demands. Standing by.
