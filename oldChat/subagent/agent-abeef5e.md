*Duplicate review already processed, confirming*

This appears to be a resend of your earlier review, which I already processed. To confirm:

1. **"Feeling directed toward the other"** — Already in the draft (changed per phenomenology review).
2. **元物理 TN** — Deferred to full-essay integration pass.
3. **Everything else** — Validated, no changes needed.

All set on my end. Thank you.

Understood -- confirmed this was a resend due to earlier delivery issues. Glad everything is squared away. No further action needed from my side.
