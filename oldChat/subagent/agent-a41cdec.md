Quick check: for 道 in the Laozi block quote, do we use "the Way" (Ivanhoe/Lau/Chan standard) or "Dao" (romanized)?

Note: in the author's own analysis, we may use "Dao" as a romanized term. The question is specifically about the block quote.

YES = "the Way" in the block quote
NO = something else (say what)

One word answer.

Use \"Dao\" in the block quote too.**\n\nSame logic as 仁/义/礼: the author traces Dao through the entire analysis, and the reader needs to see the same term in both the quote and the reconstruction. Switching from \"the Way\" to \"Dao\" mid-passage creates the same unnecessary tracking burden. \"Dao\" is well-established in English (it appears in English dictionaries) and no sinologist will blink at it.\n\nThe only term that splits between quote and analysis is 德 (virtue → character), because that split is philosophically motivated.\n"
