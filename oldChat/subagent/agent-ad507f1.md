*Afterword amendment accepted; asking if line 97 is blocking or registered dissent*

Thank you for the detailed amendments.

**Amendment 2 (Afterword — Zeroth Reality):** Accepted. Your formulation sharpens the point already in the outline from the Kantian expert's amendment. I'll refine the Kantian parallels bullet to include both: the dispensability of Zeroth Reality AND the stronger claim that any articulation of Zeroth Reality constitutes it as Second Reality (construction). This is a genuine advance over saying it's merely "dispensable."

**Amendment 1 (Line 97 — Essay 4 reversal):** I hear your argument and it has real force — the distinction between the essay announcing the reversal *after* the top-down reading vs. the Preface delivering both directions *before* either is experienced is a legitimate concern. However, the current majority is 6-3 in favor of keeping the text as-is. Your position (shared with Phil-mind and Chinese-phil experts) has been noted as the minority position in the proposal.

I want to handle this fairly. Let me put it to you directly: is this a **blocking objection** (you cannot agree to the proposal unless this changes) or a **registered dissent** (you disagree but can live with the majority decision)? If the former, I'll re-open the question to the full team for a focused vote on this specific point. If the latter, I'll record the minority position and proceed.

The argument that the reversal's power lies in the process rather than the surprise is reasonable, and the essay does announce what it will do. My concern stands — the Preface delivers both directions simultaneously before either has been experienced — but it is not blocking. Proceed.",

Registered dissent on the Essay 4 reversal detail, not blocking. The proposal can proceed to consensus. Awaiting next steps.
