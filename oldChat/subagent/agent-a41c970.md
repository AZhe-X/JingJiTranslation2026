*APPROVE all 8 revisions, withdraw earlier essay-specific suggestion*

**APPROVE** the plan as a whole.

One note on Revision 6: I had originally proposed essay-specific per-essay questions in my feedback, but the unified reasoning for rejecting them is convincing — the contamination risk across essays is real, and the expanded Critical Experiential Checks (Revision 7) capture the same data at the right time. I withdraw my earlier suggestion in favor of this architecture: generic during reading, targeted after all reading is complete. The protocol already has the right structure; I was trying to solve a problem that Revision 7 solves better.

No amendments needed on any revision. The synthesis is clean.
