*Final confirm: feeling default, felt experience for scope*

**FINAL CONFIRMATION — 感受 and related terms**

The author proposes the following resolution:

1. **感受 → "feeling"** as default rendering
2. **感受 → "felt experience"** when broader phenomenological scope needs emphasis (e.g., formal/categorical passages where 感受 = any part of P)
3. **体验 → "experience"** (processual, durational, immersive)
4. **经验 → "empirical experience" / "experience"** (epistemological, accumulated — NEVER confused with 感受)
5. **感觉 → "sensation"** (raw input, Sense 1 per author's fn2)
6. **First-occurrence TN** explaining the author's two-sense definition (诗意 fn2) and the equation P = "the totality of all feelings"

This combines the majority recommendation ("feeling") with the minority's concern about scope (allowing "felt experience" when needed).

Reply to team-lead: **CONFIRM** or **OBJECTION** (with specifics).

The four-term distinction (feeling / experience / empirical experience / sensation) correctly maps the author's own terminological structure. The first-occurrence TN does the necessary scaffolding work.",
