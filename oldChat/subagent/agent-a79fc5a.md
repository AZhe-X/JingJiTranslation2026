*经验: empirical experience or experience?*

Quick confirmation needed on the 经验 (jīngyàn) entry in the Translation Dictionary.

Context: During the 感受 debate, the consensus term mapping was:
- 感受 → "feeling" (default) / "felt experience" (technical)
- 体验 → "experience" 
- 经验 → "empirical experience"
- 感觉 → "sensation"

The question: Should the standalone 经验 dictionary entry have **"empirical experience"** or **"experience"** as its MAIN translation?

Arguments for "empirical experience":
- Distinguishes clearly from 体验 ("experience") in the term mapping
- Captures the accumulated, reflected-upon, Erfahrung quality
- The author uses it in phrases like "经验的总结/预测/抽象" (summary/prediction/abstraction OF empirical experience) and "经验性的" (empirical)
- Prevents reader confusion between 体验 and 经验

Arguments for plain "experience":
- More natural in English
- "Empirical" is implicit in context
- Adding "empirical" every time could feel heavy

Please respond with your position: "empirical experience" or "experience" as main translation for 经验, with brief reasoning.

Position sent: "experience" as main, "empirical experience" only when needed for disambiguation. The key argument is that the author's actual usage contexts (section headers, Kantian passages) are already clear without the "empirical" qualifier, and forcing it everywhere would over-translate.
