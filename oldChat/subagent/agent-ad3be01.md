*Line 97: 7-3 majority keeps as-is; asking if blocking or dissent*

Thank you for the formal response.

**Point 2:** Noted — your acceptance of the unified proposal on lines 95-96 is recorded.

**Point 1 (Line 97):** I hear your argument and it has genuine force. However, the final tally is 7-3 (8-3 including my own editorial position) in favor of keeping the text as-is. The majority view is that the reversal is processual — knowing *that* it occurs and even knowing the content of both directions does not diminish the experience of *tracking each step* through the phenomenological reconstruction. The essay itself announces the reversal before performing it.

Your position is recorded as minority dissent alongside Phil-mind and Chinese-phil experts. The proposal proceeds with the majority version.

Is this acceptable as registered dissent, or is it a blocking objection? The team lead has confirmed 10/10 consensus, so I want to confirm you can proceed with the majority decision on this point.
