*经验: empirical experience or experience?*

Quick confirmation needed on the 经验 (jīngyàn) entry in the Translation Dictionary.

Context: During the 感受 debate, the consensus term mapping was:
- 感受 → "feeling" (default) / "felt experience" (technical)
- 体验 → "experience" 
- 经验 → "empirical experience"
- 感觉 → "sensation"

The question: Should the standalone 经验 dictionary entry have **"empirical experience"** or **"experience"** as its MAIN translation?

Arguments for "empirical experience":
- Distinguishes clearly from 体验 ("experience") in the term mapping
- Captures the accumulated, reflected-upon, Erfahrung quality
- The author uses it in phrases like "经验的总结/预测/抽象" (summary/prediction/abstraction OF empirical experience) and "经验性的" (empirical)
- Prevents reader confusion between 体验 and 经验

Arguments for plain "experience":
- More natural in English
- "Empirical" is implicit in context
- Adding "empirical" every time could feel heavy

Please respond with your position: "empirical experience" or "experience" as main translation for 经验, with brief reasoning.

My recommendation: **"experience"** as the main dictionary entry for 经验, with "empirical experience" available as a contextual variant when 经验 and 体验 collide in proximity. The compound structures (经验的总结/预测/抽象) already disambiguate without needing "empirical" prepended every time.
