*Format for classical Chinese quotes: original + glossed English + plain English after?*

Question from the author about rendering classical Chinese (文言) quotations in the translation:

Proposed format: When a classical Chinese passage is quoted (e.g., from the Yijing, Lunyu, Daodejing, or the author's own 道德仁义礼 sequence analysis), the translation would:

1. **Present the original Chinese text** (文言)
2. **Follow with English translation** that includes inline romanization and Chinese for key terms on first occurrence — e.g., "humaneness (仁, ren)" — and later uses just the English, e.g., "phenomenal humaneness"
3. **After that first introduction**, use only the English rendering (e.g., "humaneness") in running text

So the reader sees:
- The original 文言 text (preserved)
- An English translation with key terms glossed on first appearance
- Pure English thereafter

Is this a good approach? Does it balance accessibility with fidelity to the source? Any concerns about cluttering the text, or about how to handle terms that appear in both 文言 quotations and the author's own modern Chinese? Keep your response concise.

This distinction is the entire philosophical point of the passage -- the author is showing that 仁 (as a metaphysical concept) is generated from 现象仁 (as lived experience), even though the traditional framework presents the reverse.\n\nThe translat

Endorsed the format and flagged the key structural concern: the 仁 vs. 现象仁 distinction must remain visually clear throughout, with "phenomenal" as the prefix doing double duty -- marking the experiential register and echoing the central concept of 现象/phenomenon. Standing by.
