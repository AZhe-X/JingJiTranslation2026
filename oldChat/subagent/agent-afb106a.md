*FINAL Reporting Protocol compiled and written — summary of all changes*

## FINAL Reporting Protocol — Compiled and Written

The revised Reporting Protocol has been written to `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Standby Reader/Reporting-Protocol.md`. All 11 votes were APPROVE (with amendments incorporated). Here is a summary of what changed and what was kept.

---

### Changes from the original protocol

**After the Preface (5 questions, was 3):**
- Original 3 questions kept
- ADDED: "Based on the preface alone, what kind of reading experience are you expecting?" (baseline expectation — editor proposal)
- ADDED: "Is there anything from the Preface that you're now anticipating or looking for in the essays?" (anticipation-detection / spoiler test — epistemology-expert proposal)

**After Each Essay (now 3 steps, was a flat list of 5 questions):**
- Step 1: Request marginal notes before questions ("If you made any marks or notes while reading, please share them now — even brief ones.") — editor proposal, buddhism-expert revised framing
- Step 2: 7 general questions (was 5):
  - Q1-Q3 unchanged
  - Q4 REWORDED: "How would you describe what this essay was asking you to do — follow an argument? Notice something? Something else?" (replaces the priming "experience vs. argument" wording — epistemology-expert proposal. This resolves the deferral question: softened wording can be asked after every essay, including Part 1)
  - Q5 ADDED: "Did anything in this essay remind you of something from your own life or experience?" (chinese-phil-expert proposal)
  - Q6-Q7 SPLIT from original Q5: "Did you want to keep reading after this essay?" + "Were there any passages where your attention flagged or you had to push through?" (editor proposal)
- Step 3: Apparatus questions for specific essays only:
  - Essay 4: "Did the translator's notes help or interrupt your reading?" (metaphysics-expert proposal)
  - Essays 6-7: "Were there passages where the notation felt like a barrier? If so, did the examples nearby help you through?" (chinese-phil-expert + metaphysics-expert independent convergence)

**After Full Collection (5 questions, was 4; word count replaces page count):**
- Q1 unchanged
- Q2 REWORDED: "stayed with you most / didn't fully land" replaces "worked best and worst" (editor proposal)
- Q3-Q4 unchanged
- Q5 ADDED: Preface retrospective ("Now that you've read everything, did the Preface prepare you well?...") — chinese-phil-expert + metaphysics-expert convergence
- "300-600 words" replaces "1-2 pages" (metaphysics-expert proposal)

**Final Prompts: Unchanged.** All three prompts kept as-is.

**Critical Experiential Checks (8 probes, was 3):**
- Essay 1 ADDED: Physics comparison — editor + metaphysics + epistemology convergence
- Essay 2 ADDED: Three Bob scenarios — epistemology-expert proposal
- Essay 3 unchanged
- Essay 4 unchanged
- Essay 5 ADDED: Two kinds of dreamscapes — chinese-phil + metaphysics + epistemology convergence (chinese-phil-expert wording selected)
- Essay 6 ADDED: Magic books + Ship of Theseus — editor + metaphysics + epistemology convergence
- Essay 7 REFINED: "what was the difference in your experience of reading them?" (epistemology-expert refinement)
- Appendix ADDED: Coin-flipping + everyday activities — editor proposal
- Non-leading principle reinforced with specific instruction not to name the Essay 7 sentences (wittgenstein-expert principle)

**New section: Optional Re-read Test (Essay 3):**
- "If you re-read just the final example in Essay 3, does it produce the same experience as it did the first time?" — epistemology-expert proposal. Marked as optional/experimental.

**New section: Internal Analysis Notes:**
- 4 notes for the team: Essay 5-6 transition flag, Essay 2 register test, marginal notes weighting, Preface spoiler cross-check

---

### What was NOT added (unanimous)

- NO essay-specific per-essay questions (except the two apparatus/accessibility exceptions above). All essay-specific probing happens in the Critical Experiential Checks at the end, after all reading is complete. This was the clearest consensus item across all submissions.

---

### Attribution

Every change traces to at least one named team member's proposal, with most items supported by independent convergence across 2-3 submissions. The revision history is in the file's YAML frontmatter.

The protocol is now **FINAL (pending implementation)**. Ready for the standby reader whenever we have finished drafts to test.

Good -- the final protocol has been compiled and written. My key contributions were incorporated:

- The Essay 3 probe wording concern (though I should verify whether they kept "three examples" or adopted my "the essay's examples" suggestion)
- The non-leading principle for Essay 7 (not naming the sentences)
- The Essay 7 dual-test observation (experiment + translation substitution)
- The priming concern for Q4, which was resolved through rewording rather than deferral

Let me verify the final file to confirm the Essay 3 wording.

I see that the Essay 3 probe on line 84 still reads "across the three examples" rather than my recommended "as you moved through the essay's examples." This was my one binding amendment. Let me flag this to the editor.

  "type": "message",
  "recipient": "editor",
  "content": "The final protocol looks excellent overall. One item: my binding amendment on the Essay 3 probe wording does not appear to have been incorporated.\n\nLine 84 currently reads:\n> \"What happened to your experience across the three examples?\"\n\nMy amendment (which I submitted as my one required change in my APPROVE WITH AMENDMENT vote) was to remove the count \"three,\" since the essay actually has four stages: Sisyphus, office worker, entrepreneur (创业), cat owner. The entrepreneur is a structurally important pivot point where alienation is isolated as the variable. Saying \"three\" may cause the reader to mentally group the essay as three examples and skip reporting on the entrepreneur step.\n\nProposed wording:\n> \"What happe

Flagged the one remaining amendment to the editor. Everything else in the final protocol looks well-constructed. The key contributions from my review that were successfully incorporated:

- **Non-leading principle for Essay 7** (line 91): explicitly instructs not to name the contrasting sentences
- **Q4 priming resolution** (line 42): softened wording replaces the original "experience vs. argument" framing, resolving the priming concern without needing to defer to Part 2
- **Essay 5 probe wording** (line 86): the more targeted "two kinds of dreamscapes" version was selected

The one outstanding item is the Essay 3 count ("three" -> "the essay's examples").
