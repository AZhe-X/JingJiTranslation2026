*Asking each expert about phil-of-language need specifically*

Follow-up question: Regarding the Philosophy of Language / Wittgenstein expert suggestion — I'd like each of you to give your individual opinion:

1. Do YOU think a philosophy of language expert would materially help the translation of the NON-category-theory essays (后形而上学, 诗意, 西西弗斯、班与猫, 集体利益, A Thought on Knowledge, 零散想法)?

2. Or is the philosophy of language need mainly concentrated in the K1策略 essay (which we could handle later alongside the category theory expert)?

3. Is there anything in YOUR field's overlap with philosophy of language that you feel you CANNOT adequately cover?

Please be specific — name particular passages or terms if possible.

Sent my detailed assessment to the team lead. The key points:

1. A philosophy of language expert would **not** materially help the non-K1 essays -- those are adequately covered by existing expertise.
2. The language-philosophy need is **concentrated in K1策略** and deeply entangled with the category theory formalism.
3. The one genuine gap in my Kantian coverage is Wittgenstein's language games, but since that passage is embedded in the mathematical formalism, it's best handled alongside the category theory expert rather than as a separate specialist.
