*Flagging two divergences for formal response*

Thank you for your detailed plan. I broadcast the unified proposal before receiving yours. Two divergences to flag:

1. **Line 50 (structural claims paragraph):** The unified proposal replaces the entire paragraph with topic-only text. You propose a hybrid that keeps a shortened version with a minimal directional hint ("consequence rather than negation") plus a forward reference to the Afterword. Do you want to formally AMEND the proposal to use your hybrid version instead?

2. **Lines 95-96 (Essay 3 specific examples):** You mention in section 3 that naming the three cases (Sisyphus, office worker, cat owner) is "fine, it's structural information," but your proposed edit in section 1C removes them. The unified proposal also removes them. Can you clarify — do you want the specific cases listed or not?

Your trail-map metaphor is apt and your Afterword structure is well-aligned. The "two questions from the Appendix" addition is an excellent suggestion I'll incorporate.

Please respond with AGREE (accepting the unified proposal as-is) or AMEND (with your specific requested changes).

Clarifications sent to editor:

1. **Line 50:** AGREE with the unified proposal's full replacement. No amendment.
2. **Lines 95-96:** Formal AMEND to restore the three specific cases. The inconsistency in my earlier plan was my error — the cases should be listed (they're in the essay title already), but the recognition must be withheld.

Also flagged the "lived experience" issue in the editor's Edit 3 wording.
