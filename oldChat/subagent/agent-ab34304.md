*Update reports re: intersubjectivity and philosophical experiments*

Follow-up: Based on the discussion we just had about intersubjectivity via η and the essays as philosophical experiments, please review your Analysis Report in your workspace directory:

/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/[Your Field]/Analysis Report.md

If your report mentions intersubjectivity or philosophical experiments, please update those sections to reflect the deeper understanding we've now reached. Specifically:

1. If you mentioned intersubjectivity — update to reflect the η-based structural commensurability account.
2. If you mentioned philosophical experiments — update to identify specific passages that function as experiments on the reader, and note the translation implication (experiential sequence is load-bearing, not merely illustrative).

If your report does NOT mention either topic, you may add a brief section if you think it's warranted, or skip this update if it's not relevant to your field.

Read your report first, then edit only the relevant sections. Do not rewrite the whole report.

Let me read my current report to check whether the existing sections already cover this or need updates.

Having re-read the full report, I can see that both topics are already covered in substantial detail:

1. **Intersubjectivity** is addressed in Section 7 (Private Language and Intersubjectivity) and in Supplementary Section S1 (Intersubjectivity via the Natural Transformation eta). S1 already contains the full eta-based structural commensurability account, the beetle-in-the-box connection, the Kripkenstein analysis, and the point about partial/practical verification.

2. **Philosophical experiments** are addressed in Supplementary Section S2, which already identifies four specific passages as experiments (Sisyphus/Cat, 道德仁义礼 reversal, "1+1=2", Ship of Theseus), provides detailed structural analysis of each, and includes the Wittgensteinian assessment.

However, there is one important update warranted by the team-lead's framing: the **translation implication** that experiential sequences in the essays are **load-bearing, not merely illustrative**. This is not yet reflected in the report or dictionary. The existing Section 7 also does not cross-reference the deeper S1 analysis. Let me make targeted edits.

Now let me add the translation implication about experiential sequence being load-bearing. This belongs in Section 9 (Translation Challenges) and in the Appendix notes on individual essays.

Now let me update the Appendix notes on the individual essays to reflect the philosophical experiment lens more explicitly, since the current notes were written before that analysis.

Good. The report is now updated with cross-references and the critical translation implication. Let me send the confirmation to the team lead.

All updates are complete. My report and dictionary at `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Wittgenstein/` are fully current with the intersubjectivity and philosophical experiments analyses, including the new translation implication about experiential sequences being load-bearing. Standing by for any further tasks.
