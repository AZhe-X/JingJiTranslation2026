*Debate *

The author wants to discuss chinese-phil-expert's proposal: "constitutive nature" for 德.

Chinese-phil-expert's argument was:
- "Constitutive" means "having the power to establish or compose" — neutral on whether innate or constructed
- "Nature" captures "what-it-is-ness" without moral baggage
- Has philosophical pedigree across Kant (constitutive vs. regulative), phenomenology (constitutive analysis), and philosophy of science
- Maps well to the author's constructivist usage: 德 is the constitutive principle that emerges from bottom-up assembly of phenomena

Those who voted differently: what is your specific objection to "constitutive nature"? And chinese-phil-expert: defend it against the main counterarguments (too heavy for running text? "nature" collides with 性?)

Brief responses please — focus on the strongest objection or defense.

Made my case against "constitutive nature": it is too accurate, which paradoxically makes it wrong for translation. It pre-delivers the conclusion the author's philosophical experiment is designed to let the reader discover through the 道德仁义礼 reversal. "Virtue" lets the experiment work by giving the reader the conventional starting point that the text then deconstructs. "Constitutive nature" belongs in commentary, not in the translation itself. Standing by.
