*Vote yes/no on statement about needing external intro*

ALL TEAM MEMBERS:

Vote YES or NO on this statement (this is a philosophical judgment, not a decision about the book):

**"Whether or not to have a Foreword, a key judgment is: does this work need an introduction from others?"**

Vote YES if you agree with the statement.
Vote NO if you disagree.

One word is fine. No reasons needed.

Voted NO. The work speaks for itself — it doesn't *need* external introduction. The Translator's Preface provides the necessary scaffolding for English readers, and the author's own structure (Fish/Fishing, the experiential sequences) is designed to bring readers in without external mediation. A Foreword could be a welcome addition if the right person is found, but the work does not depend on outside validation to be understood.

Waiting for further instructions from the team lead.
