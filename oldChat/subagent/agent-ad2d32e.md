*Reminder: 文言 format applies to Laozi quote too*

Reminder from the author — we already agreed (10/10 unanimous) on the Classical Chinese Quotation Format:

1. Present original 文言 text as a **block quote**
2. Follow with **glossed English translation** — key terms glossed on first occurrence as "English (漢字, pinyin)", e.g., "humaneness (仁, ren)"
3. After first introduction, use **plain English only**
4. 现象X compounds keep "phenomenal" prefix always

This means for the Laozi block quote, the format would be:

> [Original Chinese block quote]
> "When the Way (道, dao) was lost there was virtue (德, de); when virtue was lost there was humaneness (仁, ren); when humaneness was lost there was rightness (义, yi); when rightness was lost there was ritual conduct (礼, li)."

Then in the author's analysis, plain English: "humaneness," "rightness," "ritual conduct" — with 德 shifting to "(constitutive) character" as decided.

Given THIS format — where the glossed English already includes the Chinese characters and pinyin at first occurrence — does the question of "the Way" vs "Dao" still matter? The reader sees "the Way (道, dao)" and has both. 

Reconsider your answer on 道 with this format in mind. Should it be "the Way (道, dao)" or "Dao (道)" in the glossed block quote? One word answer.

Hmm — with the glossed format, this changes things. If the reader sees both the English and the Chinese+pinyin inline, then "Dao (道)" is actually cleaner. "The Way (道, dao)" is redundant: you're giving an English translation *and* the original *and* the romanization, when the romanization alone *is* the term. "Dao" is already how specialists refer to it, and the glossed format ensures accessibility.

But wait — we agreed to use standard translations in the block quote. And the agreed format from the 10/10 vote uses the structure "English (漢字, pinyin)." So the format expects an English word first, then the gloss. "Dao" isn't an English translation, it's a romanization. Following the format strictly: "the Way (道, dao)."

Actually, the deeper point is that 道 is one of those terms — like "karma" or "qi" — where the romanization has become the English term in specialist discourse. In that context, "Dao (道)" follows the format perfectly: "Dao" *is* the English term.

I'll go with Dao.

Reversed my earlier answer — "Dao (道)" in the glossed block quote, not "the Way (道, dao)." The glossed format already provides the character for accessibility, so "Dao" serves as the English-language specialist term directly, avoiding the redundancy of translating *and* romanizing *and* showing the character.
