*Humaneness vs benevolence in Laozi block quote?*

New question about the Laozi block quote translation. We decided to use standard translations in the block quote (Option B). But there's a tension:

Our dictionary has:
- 仁 → "humaneness" (main), "benevolence" (alternative)
- 义 → "rightness" (main), "righteousness" (alternative)  
- 礼 → "ritual conduct" (main), "ritual" / "propriety" (alternatives)

Standard academic translations of the Laozi Ch. 38 passage use:
- 仁 → "benevolence" (Lau, Ivanhoe), "humanity" (Chan)
- 义 → "rectitude" (Lau), "righteousness" (Chan, Ivanhoe)
- 礼 → "rites" (Lau), "propriety" (Chan), "ritual" (Ivanhoe)

For the Laozi block quote specifically, should we:
A) Use standard Laozi translations (benevolence, righteousness, rites/ritual) — then switch to our terms (humaneness, rightness, ritual conduct) in the author's analysis
B) Use our dictionary terms throughout (humaneness, rightness, ritual conduct) — even in the block quote
C) Something else?

Note: we already decided "virtue" in the block quote → "(constitutive) character" in the analysis for 德. The question is whether that same split applies to 仁/义/礼 too.

Brief response.

Here is the key difference from 德: with 德 we made a genuinely unusual departure (\"character\" instead of \"virtue\"), so keeping \"virtue\" in the canonical quote prevents confusion. But \"humaneness\" for 仁, \"rightness\" for 义, and \"ritual conduct\" for 礼 are all well-established academic options — they are not unusual or idiosyncratic. A reader will recognize them immediately.\n\nSwitching terms between the block quote and the analysis for three separate concepts would create more confusion than it prevents. The reader would have to track that \"benevolence\" in the quote = \"humaneness\" in the analysis, \"righteousness\" = \"rightness\", \"rites\" =
