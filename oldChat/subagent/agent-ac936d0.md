*Update reports re: intersubjectivity and philosophical experiments*

Follow-up: Based on the discussion we just had about intersubjectivity via η and the essays as philosophical experiments, please review your Analysis Report in your workspace directory:

/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/[Your Field]/Analysis Report.md

If your report mentions intersubjectivity or philosophical experiments, please update those sections to reflect the deeper understanding we've now reached. Specifically:

1. If you mentioned intersubjectivity — update to reflect the η-based structural commensurability account.
2. If you mentioned philosophical experiments — update to identify specific passages that function as experiments on the reader, and note the translation implication (experiential sequence is load-bearing, not merely illustrative).

If your report does NOT mention either topic, you may add a brief section if you think it's warranted, or skip this update if it's not relevant to your field.

Read your report first, then edit only the relevant sections. Do not rewrite the whole report.

Let me read my current report first to see what needs updating.

Good. I can see the report. I need to update two sections:

1. **Section 9, point 2 ("The intersubjective dimension")** -- this currently says the framework is "largely focused on individual experience" and the intersubjective door is merely "opened." This needs significant revision to reflect the η-based account.

2. **Section 9** needs a new subsection on **philosophical experiments** identifying specific passages as experiments, with the translation implication about preserving performative structure.

Let me make both edits.

Now let me add the philosophical experiments section before the Final Assessment.

The entire Buddhist pedagogical tradition treats teachings as devices for producing specific experiential transformations, not descriptions of objective truth. The Lotus Sutra's parable of the burning house is explicitly about constructing a 境 to produce a specific transforma

Report updated with both sections. The key additions:

- **Intersubjectivity:** Now reflects η as structural commensurability, paralleled with Chan 契 (tallying), Dignaga's apoha, and the Yogacara caveat about shared karmic conditioning.
- **Philosophical experiments:** Five specific passages identified as experiments, connected to Buddhist upaya and koan practice, with the translation implication that experiential sequencing is load-bearing.

Standing by for further tasks.
