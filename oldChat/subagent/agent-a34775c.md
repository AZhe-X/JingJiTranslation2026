*STV vote: who should write the translation*

VOTE REQUEST: Who should do the main writing/translation of the 境集 essays?

We need to decide who will be the primary translator/writer. Please cast a Single Transferable Vote (STV) by ranking your preferences. The candidates are:

1. metaphysics-expert
2. phenomenology-expert
3. epistemology-expert
4. existentialism-expert
5. phil-mind-expert
6. kantian-expert
7. chinese-phil-expert
8. buddhism-expert
9. wittgenstein-expert
10. NEW: a dedicated Writer/Translator agent (if you vote for this, specify what kind of writer -- e.g., literary translator, philosophical translator, bilingual stylist, etc.)

Please respond with:
- Your ranked ballot (1st choice, 2nd choice, 3rd choice, etc. -- rank as many as you want)
- A brief justification for your top choice
- Whether you self-recommend, and why or why not

Remember: the writer will do the actual English prose of the translation, consulting all experts' dictionaries and reports. They need strong English prose, philosophical sensitivity, AND ability to handle the Chinese source text.

Vote submitted. My ranking is:

1. A dedicated philosophical translator agent (new)
2. chinese-phil-expert
3. phenomenology-expert
4. myself (wittgenstein-expert)
5. existentialism-expert

The core reasoning: translation is a distinct craft from philosophical analysis, and this collection's mix of technical category theory, literary metaphor, classical Chinese references, and multiple philosophical traditions demands someone whose primary skill is rendering Chinese philosophical prose into English, not analyzing it from within one tradition.
