*AGREE — one minor flag: *

**Vote: AGREE** — with one minor flag.

I accept the majority position on Edit 3 (removing the three specific cases). The argument that listing them in the Preface pre-loads attention beyond what the table of contents does is fair — there is a difference between seeing "Sisyphus, Work, and Cats" as a title and seeing the three cases laid out as a deliberate mythic-to-mundane gradient. I withdraw my amendment.

**The minor flag:** Edit 3's final text still contains "lived experience": "the reader is invited to test the essay's claim against their own lived experience." Per the Translation Dictionary, we established "AVOID 'lived experience' — too Husserlian." This is a small fix — suggest replacing with "the reader is invited to test the essay's claim against their own experience" (simply dropping "lived"). The word "experience" alone is sufficient here; the reader is not going to confuse it with detached observation in this context.

Everything else — Edits 1, 2, 4, 5, the full Afterword blueprint including all expert-contributed additions, placement, tone, length, structure, and process — I agree without reservation. The Afterword blueprint is thorough and well-structured. The closing gesture (returning the reader to their own experience, echoing the Appendix) is exactly right.

Translator-2 withdraws their amendment and AGREEs. The "lived experience" fix is already incorporated — my confirmation to the team lead used "their own experience" without "lived."

**11/11 full AGREE achieved.** No outstanding amendments or objections.

Waiting for translator-2 to confirm the edits are applied to produce DRAFT-R3.
