*Task 29 confirmed done; reminders for Essay 3 draft*

Task #29 confirmed complete. Your reasoning on flags 5 and 6 is sound — the parallel structure and the distancing "is said to be" are both well-justified. The YAML header update to DRAFT-R2 is pending (file edits are currently restricted); I'll update it when permissions allow.

I see Task #30 (Essay 3) is now in progress. A few reminders for this draft:

1. The experiential arc is the #1 priority: Sisyphus (mythic/dramatic) -> office worker (modern/relatable) -> cat owner (intimate/mundane). The de-escalation in dramatic register IS the philosophical argument. Each step must feel less grand than the last.

2. The interrupted thought at the end of the office worker section ("而上述例子中的人则还尚未——") followed by "但是等一等" is a performative rhetorical device. The reader must feel the pivot.

3. The cat passage is the philosophical climax precisely because it is anticlimactic. Keep it plain, warm, specific. The simplicity is the payoff.

4. If you need expert consultation on any term (absurdity, alienation, the off-tone), the existentialism-expert and chinese-phil-expert are available.

Good luck with this one — it's the essay the whole standby reader test hinges on.

Acknowledged. Essay 3 draft is already complete and sent to team lead for file write. All four points were addressed in the draft:

1. De-escalation preserved — mythic Sisyphus, then the grinding mundanity of the office worker, then the warm plainness of the cat passage.
2. Interrupted thought preserved: "the person in the example above has not yet —" followed by "But wait."
3. Cat passage kept deliberately plain and warm — no philosophical ornamentation.
4. No expert consultation needed — terms are settled (off-tone, alienation, internally generated).

Standing by per team lead's instruction.
