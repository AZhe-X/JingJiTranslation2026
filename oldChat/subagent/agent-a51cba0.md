*Should we TN 境界 as *

Quick question from the author on 境界:

We agreed 境界 → "bounds" / "horizon" with a footnote at line 25 (where 境界 and bare 境 appear side by side, the "conceptual birth" moment).

**New proposal:** Should we ALSO add a brief translator's note at the FIRST appearance of 境界 (line 17: "在语言的*境界*（界限）内") noting that 境界 literally = "boundary (界) of Jing (境)"?

This would give the reader two notes with different jobs:
1. **Line 17 (first occurrence):** brief TN — "境界 = boundary of Jing" (etymological primer)
2. **Line 25 (境界 and 境 side by side):** deeper footnote — the moment 境 separates from 境界

Or is one note at line 25 sufficient? Does front-loading the 境-connection at line 17 help or overburden the reader? Keep your response concise — yes/no with brief reasoning.

At this point in the essay, 境 as a technical concept has not yet been introduced -- the reader has no frame to receive the information \"境界 contains 境.\" Telling them \"this word contains a character that will become important later\" is a forward reference with no anchor. It creates a cognitive debt the reader cannot yet pay off.\n\nAt line 25, the author *themselves* performs the separation -- writing 境界 in the main clause and bare 境 in the parenthetical. This is the natural place for the note because the text itself
