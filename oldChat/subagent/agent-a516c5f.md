*Accepts all edits, concedes TN3 decline was right*

Good reasoning on declining the TN3 addition. You're right that "a priori" would import Kantian framing where none is warranted — "assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down" already does the work in the author's own terms. Better to stay within the text's own conceptual vocabulary.

All four edits look sound. Nothing further from my end.

Good — the epistemology expert confirms all edits and has no further suggestions. Nothing to action here.
