*Hybrid: Jing footnoted as *

The author proposes a hybrid solution for the 境/梦境 link:

- 境 stays as **Jing** (romanized, primary term)
- But when first introducing Jing, a footnote glosses it with a "-scape" coinage — something like "living-scape" — establishing that **-scape = 境** in the reader's mind
- Then 梦境 = **"dreamscape"** naturally contains the -scape root, and the reader sees the connection: dream-**scape** contains **-scape** = 境

This way:
- "dreamscape" stays natural and readable (Camp B wins)
- The morphological link is visible (Camp A wins)
- The -scape family works: dreamscape, and any other 境-compounds

Question: Does this work? And what would be the best "-scape" gloss for 境 in the footnote? "Living-scape"? "Experience-scape"? Something else? Brief responses.

Response sent. I endorsed the hybrid solution and recommended against picking any specific "-scape" compound as the gloss for 境. Instead: establish the *suffix* (-scape = 境) in a footnote, then let individual compounds like "dreamscape" work naturally. The reader connects them through the shared root. Parallel drawn to how Buddhist translators handle 心 (citta) across its many compounds. Standing by.
