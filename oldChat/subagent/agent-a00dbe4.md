*AGREE with AMEND: add 3 existentialist points to Afterword Section B*

AGREE — with one AMEND on the Afterword Section B.

The Preface edits are exactly right. All three changes are clean and principled. I especially endorse:

- **Edit 2 (line 50 replacement):** The new paragraph is perfect — it names topics without conclusions, and "The relationship between the two parts is itself part of the argument" is an elegant signal that the structure is load-bearing without saying how. Much better than trying to save a softened version of the structural claims.
- **Edit 3 (Essay 3 rewrite):** The decision to remove the specific listing of the three cases is the right editorial call. The Preface now practices what it preaches.
- **Edit 4 (Essay 4 kept):** Correct. The reversal is processual, not propositional.

**AMEND — Afterword Section B, existentialist positioning:**

The outline lists "The Poetic compared with Nietzsche's amor fati, Camus's revolt, Heidegger's Gelassenheit — and how it differs from all three." This is correct but incomplete from my domain. The Afterword should also include:

1. **The intoxicated/lucid dreamscape distinction as a resolution of the authenticity/bad faith problematic.** This is one of the author's most elegant philosophical moves: 沉醉 maps onto Sartre's mauvaise foi and Heidegger's das Man, while 清醒 resolves the perennial problem of how to be both fully aware of contingency and fully committed to one's projects. The author's solution (the ritual analogy — burning incense knowing it doesn't reach the dead, yet the act genuinely conveys grief) is more elegant than Sartre's underdeveloped "pure reflection" or Kierkegaard's "knight of faith." This deserves explicit treatment in the Afterword.

2. **The critique of Heidegger's Being-toward-death.** The Appendix's brief argument — that one's own death is transcendent to oneself, therefore Being-toward-death always presupposes a metaphysical framework — opens an important line of inquiry. The Afterword should note this as a genuine philosophical contribution, not just an aside.

3. **The natural transformation (η) as resolution to the intersubjectivity problem.** This is listed under "Kantian parallels" in the outline, but it has equal or greater significance for existentialism. Sartre's account of the Other (the Look) is fundamentally adversarial; Heidegger's Mitsein remains abstract. The author's η provides a structural account of commensurability that sidesteps the qualia problem entirely — understanding requires structural alignment, not content identity. This should appear in the existentialist positioning as well as (or instead of) the Kantian section.

These three points represent genuine philosophical contributions that distinguish this work from the existentialist canon. They should be explicitly addressed in the Afterword, not folded into general remarks about the Poetic.

Everything else — placement, tone, length, structure, the other four sections — I fully endorse.

All three points are genuine contributions that distinguish the work from the existentialist canon:\n\n1. **Intoxicated/lucid dreamscape as resolution of authenticity/bad faith** — the ritual analogy (burning incense knowing it doesn't reach the dead) is a concrete example that deserves explicit treatment. Added to the existentialist bullet. (Note: the \"livability\" point already in the outline complements this — together they show the author's post-nihilistic stance is both philosophically rigorous and practically inhabitable.)\n\n2. **Critique of Being-toward-death** — the transcendence argument from the Appendix is a genuine philosophical contribution.
