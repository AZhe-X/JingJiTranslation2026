*AGREE: accepting unified proposal as-is, no amendments*

**AGREE** — accepting the unified proposal as-is on both points.

On reflection:

1. **Line 97 (Essay 4):** The unified proposal is right to keep it. As I noted in my own plan, the reversal is processual — knowing that it occurs does not diminish the experience of following each step. The essay itself announces the reversal before performing it. My softening suggestion was cautious but unnecessary.

2. **Line 99 (Essay 7):** The current text is fine. "Natural transformation" is a technical term that means nothing to a reader who hasn't encountered it yet — it functions as a forward reference rather than a spoiler. My suggestion was over-protective.

The unified proposal as written is the correct resolution. No amendments needed from me.

Phil-mind expert formally withdraws both amendments and AGREES as-is. This changes the line 97 tally:

**Line 97 (Edit 4) updated tally:**
- KEEP as-is: Buddhism, Existentialism, Epistemology, Kantian, Phenomenology, Translator-2, Wittgenstein, **Phil-mind** (8)
- SOFTEN: Metaphysics, Chinese-phil (2)

The minority has shrunk from 3 to 2. The majority is now 8-2 (9-2 including me).

**All formal responses confirmed:**

| Team member | Edits 1-2 | Edit 3 (cases) | Edit 4 (line 97) | Edit 5 | Afterword |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Kantian | AGREE | AGREE | AGREE (keep) | AGREE | AGREE + amend |
| Buddhism | AGREE | AGREE | AGREE (keep) | AGREE | AGREE |
| Phil-mind | AGREE | AGREE | AGREE (keep) | AGREE | AGREE + amend |
| Phenomenology | AGREE | AGREE | AGREE (keep) | AGREE | AGREE + amend |
| Metaphysics | AGREE | AGREE | AMEND (soften) | AGREE | AGREE + amend |
| Epistemology | AGREE | AGREE | AGREE (keep) | AGREE | AGREE |
| Chinese-phil | AGREE | AMEND (keep cases) | AMEND (soften) | AGREE | AGREE + amend |
| Existentialism | AGREE | AGREE | AGREE (keep) | AGREE | AGREE + amend |
| Wittgenstein | AGREE | AGREE | AGREE (keep) | AGREE | AGREE |
| Translator-2 | AGREE | AMEND (keep cases) | AGREE (keep) | AGREE | AGREE |
| Editor (me) | AGREE | AGREE | AGREE (keep) | AGREE | AGREE |

Remaining outstanding: Metaphysics blocking/dissent on line 97, Translator-2 blocking/dissent on Edit 3 cases. Team lead already confirmed consensus. Awaiting go-ahead.
