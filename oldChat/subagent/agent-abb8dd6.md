*Duplicate review, already fully processed*

This is a resend — I already processed your review in full. To confirm the current state:

1. **Fn [^24]** — Already changed to "that which enables existence to stand" and "paper" (not "canvas").
2. **"Generated" italicization** — Already present at line 36.
3. **"Buried from view"** — Retained.
4. **逐末而忘本** — Kept without gloss.
5. **Svabhava parallel** — Noted, no cross-reference added (per your recommendation).

All set. No further action needed.
