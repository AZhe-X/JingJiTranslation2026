*Review Reporting-Protocol, send feedback to editor*

Task: Review the Reporting-Protocol.md (in Standby Reader directory) and send your advice, suggestions, or confirmation to **editor**. 

The file is at: `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Standby Reader/Reporting-Protocol.md`

Read the file, then send your feedback directly to **editor** (not to me). Editor will orchestrate everyone's suggestions and discuss back and forth until a plan is agreed. Use your own judgment throughout.

One suggestion from the project lead to consider: **Should we add essay-specific questions alongside the general per-essay questions?** For example, after Essay 1 we might ask something tailored to what Essay 1 does, after Essay 2 something tailored to Essay 2, etc. — not just the same generic template for every essay. Think about whether this would be valuable, what those questions might look like, and whether they risk priming the reader (the same concern that led us to extract this file in the first place).

Send your feedback to **editor** when ready.

The multi-stage delivery structure (general first, targeted after) and the non-leading question principle are exactly right. The \"After Each Essay\" template (lines 28-32) is good -- those five questions capture what we need without priming.\n\n### On the team-lead's suggestion: essay-specific questions\n\n**My recommendation: do NOT add essay-specific questions alongside the general per-essay template.** Here's why:\n\nThe general template already includes \"Was there a moment where something clicked or shifted for you?\" and \"Did you feel like the essay was asking you to experience something?\" These a
