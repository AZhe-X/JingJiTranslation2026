*Decisions on 4 flags: shorten coin-flip, keep *

Thanks for the review. I'm currently on standby per team lead's instruction, so I can't apply edits right now. But here are my decisions so I'm ready when cleared:

**Flag 1 (coin-flip spoiler):** Agree — shorten it. Your proposed version is good. Readers who consult the Glossary Introduction mid-reading shouldn't encounter the full mechanism before the Appendix.

**Flag 2 ("raw"):** I'd keep it. "Raw, pre-theoretical ground" has a directness that matches the author's own register when discussing phenomena — phenomena are the unprocessed starting point, and "raw" conveys that. "Pre-theoretical ground" alone is slightly too polished for what it's describing. But I won't fight this if you feel strongly.

**Flag 3 ("Readers should watch for"):** Keep it. The sentence doesn't reveal what happens, only that something worth noticing does. The priming risk is minimal and the editorial value is high.

**Flag 4 (Other Terms formatting):** Agree — convert to bulleted list. Much more readable.

Will apply all four when file permissions and standby are resolved.
