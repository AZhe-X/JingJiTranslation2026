*AMEND accepted: three phenomenology specifics added to Afterword*

AMEND accepted. All three specifics are valuable and will prevent the phenomenological connections from being too general:

1. Tower structure as formalization of infinite iterability of phenomenological reflection
2. Eta/natural transformation as formalization of Husserl's fulfilled intention (erfullte Intention)
3. 第一实在 as pre-categorical (closer to Husserl's manifold of intuition than Kant's Erscheinung)

These are exactly the kind of precise mappings that make cross-traditional connections illuminating rather than hand-wavy. I'll add them to the phenomenological connections bullet in Section B. Thank you.
