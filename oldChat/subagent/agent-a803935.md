*Debate *

The author wants to discuss chinese-phil-expert's proposal: "constitutive nature" for 德.

Chinese-phil-expert's argument was:
- "Constitutive" means "having the power to establish or compose" — neutral on whether innate or constructed
- "Nature" captures "what-it-is-ness" without moral baggage
- Has philosophical pedigree across Kant (constitutive vs. regulative), phenomenology (constitutive analysis), and philosophy of science
- Maps well to the author's constructivist usage: 德 is the constitutive principle that emerges from bottom-up assembly of phenomena

Those who voted differently: what is your specific objection to "constitutive nature"? And chinese-phil-expert: defend it against the main counterarguments (too heavy for running text? "nature" collides with 性?)

Brief responses please — focus on the strongest objection or defense.

In the 道德仁义礼 passage, the author discusses 人德 (the 德 of humans, i.e., 仁). If 德 = \"constitutive nature,\" then 人德 becomes \"the constitutive nature of humans\" -- which sounds identical to \"human nature\" (人性).

My objection to "constitutive nature" is specific: the noun "nature" collides with 性 (human nature/人性), which appears separately in the collection. "The constitutive nature of humans" (人德) would be indistinguishable from "human nature" (人性) to the English reader, but these are different concepts. "Inherent character" avoids this collision. I noted I would consider "constitutive character" as a compromise if the team preferred "constitutive" as the adjective.
