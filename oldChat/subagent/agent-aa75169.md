*Check Experiential Sequences section: fine or still spoilers?*

**All team members:** Please re-read the "Experiential Sequences as Philosophical Experiments" section in the current Preface (lines 89-101 in DRAFT-R3, now updated with redundancy fix).

File: `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Translator/Draft/Translators-Preface.md`

**Question:** Is this section now FINE for the reading experience, or does it still contain spoilers? 

Respond: **FINE** or **STILL SPOILERS** (with specific line/phrase).

**FINE** — the Experiential Sequences section is now clean. It describes method without revealing conclusions or experiential payoffs. Awaiting next task.
