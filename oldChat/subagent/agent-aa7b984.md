*Is *

The author asks: would translating 德 as "virtue" risk large misleading interpretations for readers of 境集?

Context: Chinese-phil-expert recommends "virtue" as the default (it's the mainstream sinological standard), with "potency" in specifically Daoist passages, and a glossary/TN explaining the wider senses (moral virtue → natural potency → inherent character).

But the author's usage is constructivist — 德 in 境集 is not purely Confucian moral virtue nor purely Daoist natural potency. The worry: does "virtue" carry so much moral baggage in English that it would actively mislead readers about what the author means?

Please assess:
1. How misleading is "virtue" for 德 in this author's specific philosophical context?
2. Would an alternative (e.g., "de" romanized, "character," "potency") be less misleading, or would it create other problems?
3. Is the TN/glossary sufficient to correct any misleading impression, or is the word itself too loaded?

Give your honest assessment — the author wants to know if "virtue" is safe or dangerous here.

"Virtue" is safe. The key insight: the author's 道德仁义礼 passage is *designed* to take a reader who starts with a conventional understanding and restructure it through the reversal. "Virtue" provides the necessary initial foothold that the philosophical experiment then deconstructs. Replacing it with something more "accurate" would actually undermine the experiment by pre-empting the conclusion the reader is supposed to arrive at through the text itself. A TN on first occurrence is sufficient to prime without spoiling. Standing by.
