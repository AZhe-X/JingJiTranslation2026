*Confirming 诗意 resolution: *

The author endorses the current resolution for 诗意 (shiyi):

- **"the poetic"** as the standard substantive form
- **"poetic"** as adjective
- **"poeticality"** acceptable as an occasional variant noun
- **Capitalize "the Poetic"** in the translator's introduction and glossary to signal philosophical weight

Does everyone still agree with this resolution? Any second thoughts now that we've been through the full dictionary discussion? Concise yes/no + any brief additions.

  "content": "Yes, I still agree. No second thoughts.\n\nOne small addition now that we have the -scape convention for 境: the definition of 诗意 as 清醒的梦境 (\"the lucid dreamscape\") means the reader will encounter the sentence \"The poetic is the lucid dreamscape\" at some point. With our resolved terms, this reads naturally and every word carries its earned weight -- \"poetic\" (lucid engagement with meaning), \"lucid\" (knowing, not intoxicated), \"dreamscape\" (a constructed experiential -scape). The three resolutions reinforce each other. No changes needed.",
  "summary": "Yes — 诗意 resolution still holds, reinforced by other decisions"
