*AGREE with one AMEND: add Zeroth Reality vs Ding an sich to Afterword*

AGREE — with one small AMEND on Section B of the Afterword.

The Kantian parallels subsection should include one additional point: the author's Zeroth Reality (第〇实在) differs from Kant's thing-in-itself (Ding an sich) in a decisive respect — for Kant, the thing-in-itself is a necessary limiting concept (Grenzbegriff) that reason requires; for the author, Zeroth Reality is genuinely dispensable, its "special position" disenchanted (祛魅). This is one of the collection's most radical departures from the Kantian tradition and deserves explicit mention in the Afterword. It also connects naturally to the nihilism-as-consequence claim in Section A, since the dispensability of Zeroth Reality is precisely what enables the author to treat nihilism as a transitional moment rather than a permanent condition.

Suggested addition to the Kantian bullet in Section B: "The dispensability of Zeroth Reality (第〇实在) — unlike Kant's thing-in-itself, which remains a necessary limiting concept, the author's Zeroth Reality loses its special position entirely through disenchantment (祛魅), enabling the post-metaphysical turn."

Everything else — all three Preface edits, the Afterword structure, the placement, the tone, the length range, the process — I fully endorse. The synthesis is excellent.

First formal response received. Let me track it.

**Formal responses on unified proposal:**
1. Kantian expert: **AGREE** with one AMEND (add Zeroth Reality vs Ding an sich to Afterword Section B)

The amendment is a content addition to the Afterword outline, not a structural change to the Preface edits. Easy to incorporate.
