*Confirming 诗意 resolution: *

The author endorses the current resolution for 诗意 (shiyi):

- **"the poetic"** as the standard substantive form
- **"poetic"** as adjective
- **"poeticality"** acceptable as an occasional variant noun
- **Capitalize "the Poetic"** in the translator's introduction and glossary to signal philosophical weight

Does everyone still agree with this resolution? Any second thoughts now that we've been through the full dictionary discussion? Concise yes/no + any brief additions.

  "summary": "Buddhism expert: yes, still agree with 诗意 resolution",
  "content": "**Yes. Still agree. No second thoughts.**\n\n\"The poetic\" correctly positions 诗意 as a *mode of engagement* (like \"the ethical,\" \"the aesthetic\") rather than an object or doctrine. This aligns with the author's usage: 诗意 is the lucid stance toward dreamscapes, not a thing or a theory.\n\nOne minor addition for the glossary entry: it may be worth noting that 诗意 is NOT \"poetics\" (诗学) -- the study of poetry. English readers encountering \"the poetic\" in a philosophical context might reach for Aristotle's Poetics or literary theory. A single line in the glossary (\"not to be confused with poetics as literary theory\") would prevent this.\n"

Confirmed agreement. One small addition suggested: glossary should note 诗意 is not "poetics" (诗学/literary theory) to prevent the Aristotelian misreading. Standing by.
