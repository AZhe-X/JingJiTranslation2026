*Review proposed translator profile*

DISCUSSION: Proposed profile for the dedicated philosophical translator agent. Please review and respond with whether you AGREE, or if you want to ADD, CHANGE, or REMOVE anything.

Proposed profile:
1. Native-level command of both Chinese and English
2. Philosophical training (not purely literary)
3. Literary sensibility (not purely academic)
4. Category theory / mathematical notation literacy
5. Experience with register shifts (colloquial ↔ technical ↔ poetic)
6. Translator models: Burton Watson, A.C. Graham, Brook Ziporyn

Please respond with:
- AGREE (if you're satisfied with the profile as-is)
- Or specific additions/changes/removals with justification

This is discussion time -- if you disagree with another expert's suggestion, say so. We want consensus before proceeding.

Points 1-5 capture the essential competencies, and the translator models (Watson, Graham, Ziporyn) are excellent choices for classical Chinese philosophical translation.

The single most important translation error this collection is vulnerable to is a translator who \"cleans up\" or \"tightens\" the author's examples by condensing, reordering, or abstracting them. As I argued in my report, many passages function as philosophical experiment

Vote submitted. I agreed with the base profile and proposed two additions:

1. An explicit requirement that the translator understand experiential sequences as load-bearing (not merely illustrative) -- the most important translation principle for this collection.

2. Expanding the translator models to include analytic philosophy exemplars (Anscombe's Wittgenstein translations, Brandom's prose) alongside the sinological ones, since K1策略 operates in a distinctly analytic register that Watson/Graham/Ziporyn do not cover.
