*Vote: poet vs Dichter finding — Preface, Afterword, or not included?*

**New finding from existentialism-expert:** The author's concept of the **poet (诗人)** vs Heidegger's **Dichter** — a significant difference not previously covered.

The author says in the Appendix: "我们正是这样的创造者，是自己生命和感受的诗人" — "We are precisely such creators, poets of our own lives and experiences."

**5 key differences from Heidegger's Dichter:**

1. **Universal vs singular** — "我们" (we), everyone is a poet; not a rare chosen figure like Holderlin
2. **Creator vs receiver** — paired with 创造者; the poet *makes*, not receives Being's disclosure
3. **Self-directed vs community-founding** — "自己生命和感受的诗人"; not founding dwelling for a historical people
4. **Medium-indifferent vs language-bound** — any medium works (desk arrangement, photography, cooking, memes); language has no priority
5. **Already doing it vs called to it** — "我们已经、正在、且也将继续"; the task is to *notice*, not to become

**Key insight:** The author shifts the question from "How do I become authentic?" to "How do I notice that I already am?"

**Vote:** Should this finding be included in:
- **A) The Translator's Preface**
- **B) The Translator's Afterword** (in the cross-traditional connections section)
- **C) Not included** (leave it in the expert report only)

Respond with A, B, or C, with brief reason.

The finding is genuinely significant and enriches the existentialist positioning, but it requires the reader to have already encountered the Appendix passage and felt its force. Placing it in the Preface would both spoil the passage and require explaining concepts (the poetic, Jing-construction, the everyday examples) that the reader has not yet encountered. In the Afterword, after the reader has read \"我们正是这样的创造者\" in context and felt the sweep of that closing passage, the Dichter contrast sharpens what they already experienced.\n\nFrom my domain: this finding also has a Buddhist parallel worth noting in the Afterword — the author's \"everyone is
