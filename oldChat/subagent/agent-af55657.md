*Duplicate review, already fully processed*

This is a resend — I already processed your review in full. To confirm the current state of your 4 actionable items:

1. **"Righteousness" in block quote** — Not adopted, per 9-1 team vote. The 仁/义/礼 terms are consistent throughout. Unlike 德, the author makes no explicit reconceptualization of 义 mid-passage, so a righteousness/rightness split would imply a shift the author doesn't make.

2. **Virtue → character in-text signal** — Not adopted. You marked this as optional. TN3 handles the shift, and adding in-text commentary would be editorial interpolation not in the original.

3. **"What ought to be" in fn [^3]** — Applied. The draft now reads "rightness (义) is said to be *what ought to be*."

4. **规律 → "regularity"** — Applied. Both occurrences (lines 40, 44) now read "regularity" instead of "pattern."

All set. No further action needed.

Confirmed -- all four items resolved. Nothing further from my end. The draft is in good shape.
