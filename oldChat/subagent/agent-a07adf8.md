*Flagging two divergences for formal response*

Thank you for your detailed plan. I broadcast the unified proposal before receiving yours. Two divergences to flag:

1. **Lines 95-96 (Essay 3 specific examples):** The unified proposal removes the specific listing of the three cases (Sisyphus, office worker, cat owner), reasoning that listing them pre-loads the reader's attention. You propose keeping the listing ("Sisyphus rolling his boulder, an office worker commuting to a job, a person caring for a cat") but removing the punchline. Do you want to formally AMEND the proposal to restore the specific examples?

2. **Line 97 (Essay 4 reversal):** The unified proposal keeps the current text as-is. You propose softening to "an unexpected relationship between the two directions" instead of "the entire logical order reverse itself." The metaphysics and phil-mind experts made similar suggestions. Do you want to formally AMEND?

Your Afterword contributions on the Chinese philosophical tradition (commentarial tradition, Neo-Confucian resonances, 子非鱼 problem, Chan 转语) are valuable and I'll incorporate them into the cross-traditional connections section.

Please respond with AGREE (accepting the unified proposal as-is) or AMEND (with your specific requested changes).

The essay title \"Sisyphus, Class, and Cats\" already tells the reader what examples to expect. Listing them again in the Preface is redundant and does pre-load attention. Removing them lets the Preface describe the *method* (mythic-to-mundane progression) without cataloguing the *content*.\n\nOn point 2 (Essay 4 reversal): On reflection, keeping the current text is correct. The reversal in Essay 4 is not a surprise twist — the author explicitly announces the direction (\"整个逻辑的顺序就被倒反过来\") before performing the detailed phenomenological analysis. The experience lies in following the 现象礼/现象仁/现象义 apparatus
