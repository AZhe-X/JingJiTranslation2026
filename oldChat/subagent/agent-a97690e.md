*Format for classical Chinese quotes: original + glossed English + plain English after?*

Question from the author about rendering classical Chinese (文言) quotations in the translation:

Proposed format: When a classical Chinese passage is quoted (e.g., from the Yijing, Lunyu, Daodejing, or the author's own 道德仁义礼 sequence analysis), the translation would:

1. **Present the original Chinese text** (文言)
2. **Follow with English translation** that includes inline romanization and Chinese for key terms on first occurrence — e.g., "humaneness (仁, ren)" — and later uses just the English, e.g., "phenomenal humaneness"
3. **After that first introduction**, use only the English rendering (e.g., "humaneness") in running text

So the reader sees:
- The original 文言 text (preserved)
- An English translation with key terms glossed on first appearance
- Pure English thereafter

Is this a good approach? Does it balance accessibility with fidelity to the source? Any concerns about cluttering the text, or about how to handle terms that appear in both 文言 quotations and the author's own modern Chinese? Keep your response concise.

Preserving the 文言 original is especially important here because the author is not merely quoting classical texts -- they are *analyzing the structure* of those texts. The reader needs to see the original to verify the author's claims about the sequence (道→德→仁→义→礼).\n\n**The critical distinction:** The author uses the *same characters* (仁, 义, 礼) in two different registers with two different st
