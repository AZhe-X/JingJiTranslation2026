*Romanized terms kill the philosophical experiment*

The author raises a critical point about the "philosophical experiment" argument:

If we romanize everything — Dao, De, Ren, Yi, Li — then the passage has NO English semantic content for the Western reader. The reader encounters five opaque foreign terms in a sequence. The "philosophical experiment" (where the reader first accepts a conventional understanding, then watches it get deconstructed) CANNOT work, because the reader never had a conventional understanding to begin with. The romanized terms have very few morphisms in their Jing — they are semantically empty for the English reader.

The experiment requires the reader to FEEL something when they read "virtue," "humaneness," "righteousness" — to bring their own associations — and THEN experience the reversal. If they just see "De, Ren, Yi, Li," they have nothing to reverse. The passage becomes an abstract report about foreign concepts rather than a lived philosophical experience.

Does this change your thinking? Should we use English translations (the Way, virtue, humaneness, rightness, ritual conduct) in the block quote precisely SO the philosophical experiment works on the English reader?

Reconsider. Brief response.

This is a decisive argument and I had not thought it through properly.\n\nThe whole point of the passage is: you start with concepts you think you understand top-down (the Way generates virtue, virtue generates humaneness...), and then the author shows the entire hierarchy is actually constructed bottom-up from phenomena. The reversal is the philosophical payload. For this to work, the reader must *start with a loaded understanding* -- they must feel the weight of \"virtue,\" \"humaneness,\" \"righteousness\" as concepts with real content, so that the inversion is felt, not merely reported.\n\nA reader who encounters \"De, Ren, Yi, Li\" starts with nothing. They cannot experience the reversal because they
