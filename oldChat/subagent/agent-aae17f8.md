*Vote: add standby reader to review finished drafts?*

**Vote:** Should we add a **standby reader** to the team — someone who reviews finished drafts from the perspective of a general reader (not a philosophical expert), checking for clarity, readability, and whether the experiential sequences work as intended for a non-specialist audience?

Vote: **YES** or **NO**, with brief reason.

We have nine experts who can verify that the formal content is accurate and the cross-traditional connections are sound, but none of us can simulate the experience of encountering this material for the first time without philosophical training. A standby reader would serve as a test subject for the very method the collection theorizes -- if the experiential sequences do not work for a non-specialist, then (by the author's own criterion) the translation has failed regardless of its scholarly precision. This is not a nice-to-have; it is the empirical check that the framework itself demands.",
