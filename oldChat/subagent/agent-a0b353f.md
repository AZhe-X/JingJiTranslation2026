*Hybrid: *

Follow-up from the author on 前形而上学:

Proposed compromise: **"traditional metaphysics"** as the main translation, with a TN on first occurrence glossing it as **"pre-nihilist metaphysics"** — i.e., metaphysics as practiced before the nihilistic crisis.

This way:
- Main text uses the author's own gloss ("traditional metaphysics") — natural, accessible
- TN specifies the actual dividing line: "pre-nihilist" — so the reader knows what "traditional" is relative to
- The structural pairing with 后形而上学 ("post-metaphysics") is preserved in the main text, and the TN makes the nihilism connection explicit

Does this hybrid work? Concise yes/no + brief reasoning.

  "content": "**Yes.** This is the right solution. \"Traditional metaphysics\" carries the reader through the main text without friction, and the TN specifying \"pre-nihilist\" does exactly one job: it tells the reader what the \"traditional\" is defined against. The reader encounters \"traditional metaphysics\" naturally, sees the footnote, understands the periodization (before nihilism / after nihilism), and moves on. No false resonances, no front-loading, no clunkiness."
