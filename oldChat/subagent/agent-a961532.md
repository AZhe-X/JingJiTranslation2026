  "content": "1. **Do I still like the Preface?** YES. DRAFT-R3 reads as a clean, confident, well-paced piece of prose. The narrative arc is now uninterrupted: title -> author -> structure -> bilingual nature -> hermeneutical departure -> terminology -> experiential method -> reading advice. It orients without interpreting, invites without directing. The tone is exactly right — scholarly authority without condescension, warmth without promotion.\n\n2. **Is the spoiler problem resolved?** YES. All three edits land correctly:\n   - Line 46: \"confronting the absurd through increasingly familiar examples\" names topic and method, reveals nothing.\n   - Line 50: The replacement paragraph is the cleanest solution — it names what the essays exam

Both questions answered YES. DRAFT-R3 is strong — the narrative arc flows cleanly, the spoilers are fully resolved, and the Preface now properly orients without interpreting. Ready for the next step.
