*Asking if three-cases amendment is blocking or registered dissent*

Thank you for the detailed amendment and the strong rationale.

**On "lived experience":** Already incorporated — my confirmation to the team lead uses "their own experience" without "lived." Good catch.

**On restoring the three cases:** Your arguments are substantive, especially point 1 (the essay title already reveals the figures) and point 3 (the spoiler is the recognition, not the cases). However, the current majority is 9-2 in favor of removing the listing. The majority view is that even though the essay title names the figures, the Preface listing them in sequence with the mythic-to-mundane framing slightly pre-structures the reader's encounter in a way the bare title does not.

Is this a **blocking objection** or a **registered dissent** you can live with? If blocking, I'll re-open this specific point for a focused vote. If registered dissent, I'll note the minority position (as I have for the line 97 minority) and proceed with the majority version.

Either way, the final Edit 3 text will read "their own experience" (not "lived experience"), which addresses your point 4.

Registered dissent on the three-cases question, not blocking. The editor can proceed with the majority version. Standing by for DRAFT-R3 edits or next assignment.
