---

## 1. Category Theory: Essential or Dispensable?
Does the formalism do essential philosophical work, or could insights survive without it?

**Participants:** Wittgenstein, Metaphysics, Epistemology, Buddhism, Phenomenology

**Key questions:**
- Author says "范畴论仅仅是工具的一种" — but are there insights that depend essentially on the formal apparatus?
- Hua-yen's Indra's net describes the same tower structure poetically. What does formalism add?
- Does it impose structure that appears to be discovered?

---

## 2. η as Understanding: Criterion or Redescription?
Does structural alignment provide a *criterion* for understanding, or merely redescribe what we already do? Can it bear epistemic weight?

**Participants:** Wittgenstein, Epistemology, Buddhism, Phenomenology, Philosophy of Mind

**Key questions:**
- Does η provide a criterion for *correct* understanding, or just characterize what we already do when we say "I understand"?
- Does relocating normativity to structural alignment satisfy or evade the demand for justification?
- Parallels with Dharmakīrti's *arthakriyā* (causal efficacy as validation)
- Is structural alignment sufficient for genuine phenomenological evidence (Erfüllung)?

---

## 3. S_E: Necessity vs Stability
Is empirical stability sufficient, or does philosophy require transcendental necessity? Is "stable enough to do work" enough?

**Participants:** Kantian, Metaphysics, Buddhism, Epistemology

**Key questions:**
- Author explicitly disclaims transcendental status ("仅仅是描述性的")
- Kant's transcendental deduction claims to establish what *must* be the case; author yields what *persists*
- Buddhism: Yogācāra's *saṃskāra* are empirically stable but ultimately empty — perhaps stability is all we can ask for
- Does the η-mechanism require more than contingent stability to work across persons?

---

## 4. Intersubjectivity via η
Does the naturality condition solve intersubjectivity (beetle-in-the-box), or miss the therapeutic point?

**Participants:** Wittgenstein, Kantian, Phenomenology, Philosophy of Mind

**Key questions:**
- Author claims η's naturality condition gives mathematical content to Wittgenstein's insight
- Private content drops out, structural role remains — but does this capture what Wittgenstein was after?
- Kant *postulates* shared categories; does η convert postulate into empirically investigable structural claim?
- How do we *enter* each other's meaning-contexts? How is 境 shared or transmitted?

---

## 5. Hard Problem: Sidestepped or Dissolved?
Does starting from phenomena sidestep or dissolve the hard problem? Does anātman help?

**Participants:** Philosophy of Mind, Buddhism, Phenomenology

**Key questions:**
- Framework starts FROM phenomena as methodologically first
- Does this sidestep by refusing presuppositions, or dissolve the question?
- Buddhist anātman: does "why phenomenal character?" presuppose something illegitimate?
- Is there irreducible qualitative residue that escapes structural capture?

---

## 6. 诗意: Liberation or Refined Samsara?
Is the poetic stance genuine liberation, or sophisticated engagement *within* the dreamscape?

**Participants:** Buddhism, Chinese Philosophy, Existentialism

**Key questions:**
- "Clear dream" parallels Satipaṭṭhāna ("observing feelings as feelings")
- Buddhism: does this *liberate* from duḥkha or refine engagement *within* it?
- Buddhist 方便 uses constructs as rafts to abandon; 诗意 accepts the raft as home
- Parallels with Kierkegaard's stages — closer to religious (faith through groundlessness) than aesthetic (ironic play)?

---

## 7. 恒常 vs 無常
Buddhism treats pursuit of constancy as avidyā; author treats it as irreducible ground. Fundamental divergence or reframing?

**Participants:** Buddhism, Chinese Philosophy, Kantian

**Key questions:**
- Author's 恒常 is epistemological/pragmatic ("what we seek to act meaningfully")
- Buddhism: pursuit of permanence is rooted in avidyā to be *overcome*
- Author: irreducible non-rational ground to *acknowledge and work with*
- Is this compatible reframing or fundamental divergence?

---

## 8. Death and Heidegger
Does the author's argument land? Does death's structure *constrain* adequate 境, even if it doesn't *disclose*?

**Participants:** Existentialism, Metaphysics, Phenomenology

**Key questions:**
- Author claims being-toward-death is impossible: "the death one is toward is always one's conception of death"
- Does this misunderstand death as possibility rather than concept?
- Metaphysics proposal: death doesn't *disclose* (Heidegger) but its structure *constrains* what adequate anticipation can look like
- Modal uniqueness: death terminates possibility-space rather than transforming it

---

## 9. Non-Rationality as Foundation
Is acknowledging non-rational ground (恒常-pursuit) honest or resignation? How does this reposition reason?

**Participants:** Epistemology, Kantian, Existentialism

**Key questions:**
- Pursuit of knowledge is 非理性 and "应当被承认"
- This places the normative outside rational justification entirely
- Kant treats non-rational separately (Third Critique); author makes it foundational to *entire* framework
- Is this honest acknowledgment or philosophical resignation?

---

## 10. Phenomena as Starting Point: Circular?
Does taking phenomena as 第一实在 presuppose structuring capacities it claims to ground?

**Participants:** Metaphysics, Epistemology, Phenomenology

**Key questions:**
- Selecting phenomena as objects, associations as morphisms already presupposes structuring capacities
- Is this circular, or is the circularity benign?
- Author's move: "当我们提出第〇实在时，这个我们所提出的东西就是第二实在"

---

## 11. Absence of Body/Embodiment
Merleau-Ponty's motor intentionality is implicit (cat example) but body-subject isn't thematized. Gap or feature?

**Participants:** Phenomenology, Existentialism, Philosophy of Mind

**Key questions:**
- Cat example is practically enacted meaning (convergence with Merleau-Ponty)
- But body as distinct from consciousness and physical body isn't thematized
- Is this a gap or intentional abstraction?

---

## 12. Temporality: Discrete vs Continuous
Does discrete $t$, $t+1$ indexing lose retention-protention structure of lived time?

**Participants:** Phenomenology, Kantian, Philosophy of Mind

**Key questions:**
- K1 framework uses discrete time indices
- Lived time has continuous structure (retention-protention-primal impression)
- Is discrete indexing an acceptable idealization or does it lose something essential?

---

## 13. Historical Constitution / Sedimentation
Where is tradition, genetic phenomenology, effective-historical consciousness?

**Participants:** Phenomenology, Chinese Philosophy, Kantian

**Key questions:**
- 境 seems synchronic
- Absent: Husserl's genetic phenomenology, Gadamer's effective-historical consciousness
- Where is sedimentation, tradition, historical layering of meaning?

---

## 14. 道德仁義禮 Inversion — ✅ RESOLVED
Right about epistemology (how we learn) but missing ontology (what's prior)?

**Participants:** Chinese Philosophy, Kantian, Metaphysics

**Key questions:**
- Author argues actual derivation: 禮(observed) → 仁/義(interpretation) → 德 → 道
- Tradition understands: 道 → 德 → 仁 → 義 → 禮
- May be right about *epistemology* while missing *ontology* (what's really prior)
- Is this fair to Confucian thought or distortion?

**Resolution (2026-02-12):** Author explicitly offers three interpretations in 范畴论与境 opening (structure IS essence / REPRESENTS essence / both) and declines to choose. Framework **brackets** rather than **forecloses** ontological claims. Compatible with Confucian positions on 仁's priority. **9/9 consensus.**

---

## 15. Neo-Confucian Lacuna
Why no 理/氣 or 良知? Does framework implicitly reject their premises?

**Participants:** Chinese Philosophy, Kantian, Epistemology

**Key questions:**
- No engagement with Zhu Xi's 理/氣 or Wang Yangming's 良知
- 理 as ontologically given (not constructed) would challenge framework
- 良知 as innate knowing that cuts through mediation
- Does 良知 parallel Kantian intellectual intuition?

---

## 16. Unchosen Traumatic 境
Can you engage "lucidly" with what destroys you? The poetic stance and suffering.

**Participants:** Existentialism, Buddhism, Philosophy of Mind

**Key questions:**
- Author acknowledges unchosen dreamscapes exist
- Doesn't develop what poetic stance means for trauma, oppression, suffering
- Can you engage "lucidly" with what destroys you?
- Buddhist resources for path through suffering?

---

## 17. Thing-in-Itself Dissolution
Is dissolving the thing-in-itself an advance or loss of something Kant rightly preserved?

**Participants:** Kantian, Metaphysics

**Key questions:**
- Kant retains thing-in-itself as limit concept preserving epistemic humility
- Author dissolves it entirely
- Is this verificationist move a philosophical advance or loss?

---

## 18. Construction Choice and Relativism
If every metaphysics is construction, what grounds choice? Constrained relativism or stronger?

**Participants:** Kantian, Chinese Philosophy, Epistemology

**Key questions:**
- What grounds choice among constructions?
- Author's answer: pragmatic function, preserving S_E, achieving "理想和现象之重叠"
- Is this constrained relativism or something stronger?

---

## 19. Apoha and Family Resemblance
Both reject mental particulars. Does 境集 split the difference productively?

**Participants:** Wittgenstein, Buddhism

**Key questions:**
- Both Dignāga/Dharmakīrti's apoha and Wittgenstein reject mental particulars as ground of general terms
- Apoha is positive semantic theory; later Wittgenstein is deflationary
- Does 境集 framework split this difference productively?

---

## 20. Path Theory Gap
Framework describes 境-construction but not 境-transformation stages. Limitation or intentional?

**Participants:** Buddhism, Chinese Philosophy

**Key questions:**
- Framework describes how 境 are constructed
- But not how they're transformed, what stages of development look like
- Buddhist *mārga* offers detailed path progressions
- Is this a limitation or intentional agnosticism about normative direction?
