# Draft Version 1 Comment — Buddhism Advisor

**Essay:** Essay 3 — Sisyphus, Work, and the Cat
**Draft:** DRAFT-R1
**Date:** 2026-02-13

## Overall Assessment

**Rating: Good**

The translation preserves the conversational/exploratory tone and the philosophical force of the argument. Key terms handled correctly per dictionary.

## Buddhist Resonances (Major)

This essay is extraordinary from a Buddhist perspective:

1. **The Cat Example as Koan-Punchline**: The cat owner never encounters absurdity at all — "absurdity dissolves naturally, as if it had never come." This is structurally identical to how koans work: the punchline doesn't solve the puzzle but reveals there was no puzzle. The absurd was generated by a category error (seeking meaning externally); remove the error, and the absurd vanishes — not overcome, not heroically defied, simply *absent*.

2. **Chan/Zen Parallel**: The argument that cat-raising has "immanent meaning" without requiring articulation parallels Chan teaching on ordinary activities: "Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water." The cat-raiser is not a hero; they are simply present to their activity. This is 平常心是道 — "ordinary mind is the Way."

3. **No Transcendence Required**: The author's key move — cat-raising needs no transcendent meaning, "neither internally generated nor externally given" — resonates with the Mahāyāna insight that nirvana is not somewhere else. Buddha-nature is not to be sought outside; awakening is not an achievement to acquire.

4. **Alienation ↔ Duḥkha**: The author's diagnosis of absurdity as arising from externalized meaning (*alienation*) parallels Buddhist diagnosis of suffering as arising from seeking satisfaction in external objects (*tṛṣṇā*). The cure in both cases: recognize that meaning/satisfaction is not "out there."

## Translation Choices — Confirmed

- **荒谬 → "absurdity" / "the absurd"**: Correct per dictionary.
- **异化 → "alienation"**: Correct — preserves Marxist resonance while enabling Buddhist parallel.
- **非和谐 → "dissonance"**: Good choice. Author's gloss "off-tone" preserved in context.
- **内生的意义 → "immanent meaning"**: Excellent — captures both "internally-arising" and "non-transcendent" dimensions.
- **超越/超越性 → "transcendence" / "transcendent"**: Per dictionary, correct.

## On the Translator's Notes

**TN1 (班)**: Well-crafted. The explanation that 班 is "the daily grind" (not heroic toil) is important — it sets up the contrast with Sisyphus and makes the cat example's ordinariness more visible.

**TN2 (Cat example)**: Philosophically accurate and helps Western readers grasp the significance. The phrase "dissolves the Camusian problematic rather than resolving it" is precisely correct.

## Minor Observation

The date "June 6, 2025" in the translation is "20250606" in the original (standard Chinese date format). The expanded form is reader-friendly for Western audiences — good choice.

## No Issues Requiring Changes

The draft is ready for editorial review.
