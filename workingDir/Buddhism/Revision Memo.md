## 1. 关于社会性议题 (New section in 零散想法)

**The addition:**
> 在这篇文集中，我们基本没有直接涉及到社会性议题。我们从集体利益开始，到"写到最后"结束。我们只能从自身个人的视角出发并回归自身，但我们已经、正在、且也将继续我们对境的明晰和构建。

**Discussion summary:**

Initial readings characterized this as acknowledging a gap — the collection doesn't address social issues. Awoo pushed back, pointing out that:
1. The collection opens with collective interest (Essay 1) — itself a social topic
2. The 写在最后 paragraph extensively lists social constructions: nations, educational systems, legal structures, currencies, etc.
3. The closing sentence ("我们正是这样的创造者") restores to the reader their sense of constructive agency
4. The implicit structure is: (1) all social things are constructed → (2) you are already a constructor → (3) available inference: you can construct and reconstruct

**Resolved reading:**

The author's standpoint on social issues is coherent and deliberate: social constructions are 境-constructions like any other — neither more fixed nor more sacred than a concept of "pen" or a coin-flip ritual — and the collection demonstrates this by listing them alongside personal-scale examples in the same descriptive register. The framework doesn't evaluate which social constructions are just or unjust, doesn't prescribe what should be built or changed — it starts from individual perspective and returns there. But in establishing that these structures are constructed and that we are already the ones who construct 境, it accomplishes something prior to normative politics: it removes the mystification that makes social arrangements seem given or necessary, restoring to the reader the recognition that construction is already theirs to do. **The collection empowers without prescribing — which is a deliberate choice, not a gap.**

**Buddhist parallel:** Structurally parallels how śūnyatā teaching functions — "all things lack intrinsic nature" isn't a political program, but once you genuinely see that social arrangements lack svabhāva and are dependently arisen, the false sense that "this is just how things are" is removed. Descriptive insight is practically liberating without being prescriptive about outcomes.

**Translation implication:** The 关于社会性议题 section should be translated to preserve honest scope-marking without implying evasion. The 写在最后 closing sentence should convey recognition ("we already are this") rather than political rallying.

## 2. 分析判断 (New section in 零散想法)

**The addition:**
> 注意到，（如注脚指出的）在文章中出现的两个论断皆为分析判断：
> 1. "理性的目的在理性之外"是一个关于目的的分析判断：一个东西要抵达的地方不可能是他自身，否则他就不会'要抵达'。因此这句话不取决于如何定义理性。
> 2. "哲学结构如果在经验中有稳定呈现，就可以进行经验性验证"是一个关于经验的分析判断：如果一个东西在经验中有稳定呈现，就可以进行经验性验证。因此这句话不取决于如何定义哲学结构。

### Claim 1: "理性的目的在理性之外" — Analytic

**Verdict: Unanimous Analytic (all 9 advisors)**

**Argument:** "目的" as "要抵达" (purposive directedness toward something) analytically entails a gap between the thing striving and what it strives toward. A thing's destination cannot be itself, otherwise the very concept of "needing to arrive" collapses. This holds regardless of how "reason" is defined — the claim is about the concept of *purpose*, not the content of reason.

**Note:** An initial concern was raised about immanent purposiveness (Kantian third Critique) where organisms have internal teleology — but this doesn't defeat the argument, since homeostasis tends toward a target *state different from* the current disturbed state, not literally "itself." The directional reading of 要抵达 holds.

### Claim 2: "哲学结构如果在经验中有稳定呈现，就可以进行经验性验证" — Analytic

**Final verdict: Unanimous Analytic (all 9 advisors, after 4-round debate)**

**Initial split:** 6 Analytic, 3 Synthetic (Metaphysics, Phenomenology, Buddhism)

**Debate summary (4 rounds):**

The Synthetic side opened with the Kantian counterexample: structures that condition experience (space, time, forms of intuition) have maximal stable presence yet resist empirical verification precisely because they are presupposed by any verification procedure. Synthetic side demanded: what's the difference between "stable in experience" and "empirically verifiable"? The connection requires the additional claim that phenomenal presence entails procedure-applicability — which is a methodological commitment, not a conceptual truth.

The Analytic side responded with three key moves:

1. **The grammar argument** (Wittgenstein): "在...中" (within, as content inside) grammatically marks "appearing as content within the experiential field" — not "conditioning from behind." Background conditions of experience are not "in" experience in any natural reading of 在...中; the Kantian counterexample fails the antecedent.

2. **The middle reading** (Wittgenstein): "经验性验证" means the empirical procedure is *applicable* — that experience-checking is the right method — not that intersubjective success is guaranteed. This reading is analytic: if X stably appears as phenomenal content, then checking experience is by definition the appropriate method.

3. **The KA separation** (multiple advisors): The KA conjecture ([^5]) is about formal mathematical derivability within the category-theoretic framework — whether K1 conditions can derive stable structures with universal properties. This is orthogonal to whether empirical checking is applicable in principle. KA being conjectural does not show the analytic claim is uncertain; it shows the formal derivability is an open mathematical question.

**Division of labor (key insight):**
- **Analytic claim:** IF a philosophical structure stably presents as phenomenal content in experience, THEN experience-checking is the applicable method (categorical license)
- **K1's synthetic program:** Whether specific philosophical structures actually satisfy the antecedent — that's the hard empirical work

**Phenomenology's final flip** identified the precise error in the Synthetic position: conflating the difficulty of *satisfying the antecedent* (genuinely hard synthetic work — confirming that structures stably present across subjects) with the synthetic status of the *conditional* (analytic — if they do, checking applies). The Synthetic side was correctly identifying real synthetic content but mislocating it: the synthetic question is whether the antecedent holds; the conditional itself is analytic.

**Buddhist precision maintained:**
The claim is most precisely characterized as Husserlian *material a priori* — necessarily true given the essence of experience, rather than strictly analytic by conceptual containment alone. However, for the author's purposes this distinction is practically inert: the categorical license holds either way.

**Translation implication:**
- Claim 2 is analytic, but readers should understand that confirming specific philosophical structures actually satisfy the antecedent (stably present in experience across subjects) is the hard empirical work performed by K1's experimental program — not assumed by the analytic claim, but required before the claim applies.
- "在经验中有稳定呈现" should be translated to preserve the "within/as content" reading (not "underlying/conditioning") — the grammar is doing philosophical work.

## 3. 关于死亡 — Point 2 Expansion (零散想法)

**The revision:**

Old: "自己的死亡对于自己是超越性的。因此不可能向死而生。因为这里向的死，是自己所以为的死，根据不同的形而上学对死亡的理解不同，这里背后其实就有形而上学的价值观。"

New: Added explanatory sentence — "也就是说，我们从未体验过死亡，我们对死亡的感受、理解（例如认为死亡作为生命必然发生的终点），都来源于我们所见的（不是自己的）死亡，并以这些现象为基础构建形而上，并遵循某种结构推广而应用于自己身上。"

**Discussion summary:**

The revision transforms a bare assertion into an explicit epistemological argument. The mechanism is now clear: we've never experienced our own death; our entire concept of it is constructed from third-person observations (others' deaths), processed as phenomena, abstracted into metaphysical frameworks, then structurally extended to ourselves. This follows the collection's general pattern of concept-formation (the same structure seen in 礼→仁→德→道, in the knowledge essay, in renormalization).

**Key philosophical point:**

The revision makes precise what was previously vague. Against Heidegger's "being-toward-death" (向死而生): our concept of our own death has exactly the same epistemological structure as any anticipated first-person event we've only observed in others. Heidegger's three features (ownmost, non-relational, certain-yet-indefinite) are not unique to death — they apply equally to any such projection.

**Illustrative example developed:**
Awoo proposed: a young boy, told by observed pattern that he will one day fall in love, constructs a first-person certainty ("it will happen to me, no one can take it over for me") with exactly the same epistemological structure as certainty about one's own death. The example demonstrates that "mine-ness" is a product of structural extension from third-person phenomena, not privileged first-person access.

**Proposed footnote (approved by all advisors):**
> For Heidegger, death is Dasein's ownmost, non-relational, certain-yet-indefinite possibility: it will happen to me (not to Dasein-in-general), no one can take it over for me, and its constant imminence (rather than its eventual arrival) is what structures authentic existence as being-toward-death. However, death is never unique in that sense. Consider this example: I am a young boy. I have been told that one day I will fall in love with a girl, and I believe this deeply, since I see it as the pattern for every boy around me. I can therefore say, at this moment: it will happen to me, no one can take it over for me, and its constant imminence is what structures authentic existence as being-toward-girl. Notice that my certainty about my own death has exactly the same epistemological structure as this boy's certainty about his first love.

**Status:** Footnote approved by all advisors; Awoo to propose to author via email.

**Buddhist observation:** From an *anātman* perspective, the structural extension to "oneself" presupposes a stable self available to be the subject of death — itself a construction. "My death" is thus a construction layered on a construction: the death-concept derived from others' deaths, projected onto a self that is itself conventionally constituted.

**Translation implication:** The revised passage is clear in Chinese; the proposed footnote is in English and appropriate for the translation edition. Preserve the "遵循某种结构推广而应用于自己身上" phrasing — it is the load-bearing articulation of structural extension.
