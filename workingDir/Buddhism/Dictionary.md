This dictionary provides translation recommendations for key philosophical terms in the 境集 collection, with special attention to Buddhist philosophical considerations, Sanskrit-Chinese-English translation chains, and the critical distinction between the author's usage and Buddhist technical meanings.

---

## 境 (E)

- **Main translation**: "E" (technical passages), "Scape" or "Experiential Scape" (discursive passages)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "Experiential Domain" when emphasizing the bounded nature
  - "Phenomenal Structure" when emphasizing the categorical construction
  - Keep untranslated as "jing" with explanatory note when Buddhist resonance is critical
- **Note**: This term carries the full weight of Buddhist **visaya** (विषय, sense-object), **gocara** (गोचर, range/domain), and **ayatana** (आयतन, sense-base). In Chinese Buddhist translation:
  - **Kumarajiva** used 境 to translate visaya in Yogacara texts, meaning "object-domain of consciousness"
  - **Xuanzang** used 境界 for gocara in Vijnaptimatratasiddhi (成唯識論), meaning "range of activity"
  - Traditional usage: 境 is what consciousness takes as its object, NOT an independent external world

  **Author's transformation**: The author preserves the Buddhist insight that 境 is structured by mind, not "the world out there," but adds unprecedented formal precision through category theory. The author's E is simultaneously: (1) the experiential field (Buddhist visaya), (2) the structure imposed on that field (Yogacara vijnapti-structuring), and (3) a categorical system with tower structure that can be formally analyzed. This is NOT a departure from Buddhist meaning but a mathematical formalization of it.

  **Translation rationale**: "Realm" loses the Buddhist resonance and implies ontological independence. "Sphere" or "domain" are too generic. "World" is too ontologically loaded. "Scape" (from landscape/dreamscape) preserves the phenomenological (what appears), structured (shaped by mind), and bounded (limited range) dimensions. Use "E" in technical passages to maintain the author's formal notation.

---

## 境界

- **Main translation**: "bounds," "horizon," "domain-and-limit"
- **Alternatives**:
  - "experiential boundary" when emphasizing delimitation
  - "level of attainment" when the Buddhist resonance of spiritual progress is relevant
- **Note**: In Buddhist usage, 境界 carries two overlapping meanings:
  - **Spatial sense**: the boundary or extent of a domain (e.g., 語言的境界 = the bounds of language)
  - **Soteriological sense**: level of spiritual attainment (e.g., 菩薩境界 = the level/state of a bodhisattva)

  The author uses primarily the first sense, but the second sense creates resonance when discussing "清醒的梦境" (lucid dreamscape) as a transformed state of awareness. The term implies both "where this domain reaches" and "what can be reached within this domain."

  **Translation rationale**: "Bounds" captures both meanings—spatial limits and accessible range. Avoid "boundary" alone (too rigid), "limit" alone (too restrictive), "scope" (too academic/neutral).

---

## 虚无 / 虚無主義

- **Main translation**: "nihilism" (虚無主義), "the void" or "emptiness-as-absence" (虚无)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "the vacancy" or "the absence" when emphasizing lack
  - "nothingness" when existentialist resonance is appropriate
- **Note**: **CRITICAL DISTINCTION** from Buddhist 空 (śūnyatā/sunyata):

  **Buddhist 空 (śūnyatā)**: NOT nihilism (断見, uccheda-vada). In Madhyamaka, emptiness (空) means absence of **svabhava** (自性, inherent existence), NOT absence of phenomena. Nagarjuna's MMK 24.18: "Whatever is dependently originated, that we call emptiness." Emptiness is the Middle Way between eternalism and nihilism.

  **Kumarajiva's translation strategy**: Used 空 (empty) rather than 無 (non-being) to avoid confusion with nihilism. The Chinese character 無 (wu) suggests absolute non-existence; 空 (kong) suggests empty-of-something (empty of svabhava).

  **Author's 虚无**: The void LEFT AFTER metaphysics collapses. The author explicitly states: "Nihilism is not a being, not a doctrine (主义), but an absence, a vacancy (缺位)... nothing is being produced or created anymore." This IS the nihilistic extreme (断邊) that Madhyamaka warns against. However, the author does NOT remain here—post-metaphysics is the exit from this void, parallel to the Middle Way.

  **Translation rationale**: Translate 虚无主義 as "nihilism" but ALWAYS include translator's note distinguishing from Buddhist emptiness (空). When 虚无 appears alone, consider "the void" or "nihilistic vacancy" to emphasize the negative, absence-character. Never translate 虚无 as "emptiness" (which should be reserved for 空/śūnyatā).

---

## 空

- **Main translation**: "emptiness" (when referring to Buddhist śūnyatā), "empty" (adjectival)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "void" only when clearly distinguished from 虚无
  - "vacuity" in philosophical contexts requiring precision
- **Note**: This term appears rarely in the author's text, but when it does, it carries Buddhist technical meaning:

  **Sanskrit śūnyatā → Chinese 空**: The central concept of Madhyamaka philosophy. Emptiness of svabhava (inherent existence), NOT emptiness of existence. The Diamond Sutra (金剛經): "All conditioned phenomena are like a dream, an illusion" (一切有為法，如夢幻泡影) describes emptiness, not non-existence.

  **Author's minimal usage**: In the example "when we strip away our characteristics... we eventually arrive at 'emptiness' (空)," the author acknowledges this is the WRONG approach (choosing containment relations on physical objects rather than phenomena as P). The author's framework avoids reifying 空 as a metaphysical ultimate, which aligns with Madhyamaka's rejection of 空 itself as a view to be grasped.

  **Translation rationale**: Use "emptiness" for 空 when Buddhist resonance is clear. Never conflate with 虚无. If both terms appear in proximity, use "emptiness" (空) vs. "the void/nihilism" (虚无) to maintain distinction.

---

## 清醒

- **Main translation**: "lucid" (清醒的梦境 = lucid dreamscape)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "wakeful" or "clear-seeing" in non-dreamscape contexts
  - "aware" when emphasizing consciousness without Buddhist overtones
- **Note**: 清醒 literally means "clear-awake" and carries overtones of Buddhist **bodhi** (覺, awakening). In Chinese Buddhist vocabulary:
  - 覺 (jue): awakening, enlightenment (bodhi)
  - 覺醒: to awaken (often used for enlightenment experience)
  - 清醒: everyday term for being awake/sober, but in philosophical context resonates with 覺

  **Author's usage**: "清醒的梦境" (lucid dreamscape) describes engagement with meaning-structures WHILE KNOWING they are constructions. This parallels Chan awakening's third stage: "After enlightenment, mountains are mountains again" (青原惟信)—return to full engagement with transformed understanding.

  **Difference from Buddhist awakening**: Buddhist 覺 typically implies cessation of fundamental ignorance (avidya/無明). The author's 清醒 is epistemological (knowing the constructedness) rather than soteriological (liberation from suffering). But the structural parallel is profound: both involve seeing-through without disengaging.

  **Translation rationale**: "Lucid" captures both "clear-seeing" and the dreamscape context (as in "lucid dreaming"—knowing you're dreaming while in the dream). Avoid "awakened" (too specifically Buddhist) and "conscious" (too Cartesian/neutral). "Wakeful" is acceptable but less evocative.

---

## 沉醉

- **Main translation**: "intoxicated" (沉醉的梦境 = intoxicated dreamscape)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "immersed" when intoxication metaphor is too strong
  - "entranced" when emphasizing loss of critical awareness
- **Note**: 沉醉 literally means "sink-drunk," combining submersion (沉) and intoxication (醉). In Buddhist psychology:
  - **mada** (憍, 醉): intoxication/pride, one of the klesha (煩惱, afflictions)
  - **moha** (癡): delusion, fundamental ignorance

  **Author's usage**: "沉醉的梦境" describes engagement WITHOUT awareness that meaning-structures are constructions. This is faith/belief (信念/信仰) where purpose appears logically groundless but historically conditioned. The metaphor: drunk on the dream, unaware it's a dream.

  **Buddhist parallel**: Corresponds to pre-awakening state, where one takes conceptual constructions (prapanca/戲論) as ultimately real. The intoxication metaphor recalls Buddhist warnings against the "intoxicants" (madya/酒) that cloud discernment.

  **Translation rationale**: "Intoxicated" preserves the Buddhist resonance of clouded awareness (mada) and the author's metaphor of being "drunk" on meaning. Avoid "unconscious" (too negative) and "naive" (too judgmental). "Immersed" is acceptable but loses the critique of clouded judgment.

---

## 梦境

- **Main translation**: "dreamscape"
- **Alternatives**:
  - "dream-realm" when emphasizing bounded domain
  - "dream-construction" when emphasizing constructed nature
- **Note**: 梦 (dream) + 境 (scape/domain). The author explicitly distinguishes this from "illusion to be dispelled":

  **Buddhist dream analogy**:
  - **svapna** (夢): standard example of emptiness in Madhyamaka and Yogacara
  - **Diamond Sutra**: "All conditioned phenomena are like a dream" (如夢幻泡影)
  - **Madhyamaka usage**: Dream objects FUNCTION within the dream even though they lack inherent existence. A dream fire can warm a dream body. This is NOT nihilism—it's the Middle Way.

  **Author's usage**: 梦境 is the "environment" (環境) in which meaning and purpose can exist. Games, novels, rituals, lived frameworks—all are dreamscapes. The author emphasizes: "清醒的梦境 still necessarily means full engagement" (清醒的梦境依旧也必然意味着对梦境的全身心之投入). This perfectly parallels the Buddhist bodhisattva who saves beings while knowing there are no beings to save (Diamond Sutra).

  **Critical point**: The author's 梦境 is NOT illusion (幻) to be escaped but structure to be engaged with lucidly. This aligns with Madhyamaka's insistence that emptiness doesn't negate function.

  **Translation rationale**: "Dreamscape" (not just "dream") captures the spatial/environmental dimension and the constructed-yet-immersive quality. Avoid "illusion" (implies falsity to be rejected), "fantasy" (too escapist), "construct" (too abstract/clinical).

---

## 觉 / 悟

- **Main translation**: "awakening" (覺), "realization" (悟), or "enlightenment" (覺悟)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "insight" for 悟 in non-technical contexts
  - "bodhi" (untranslated) when Sanskrit reference is critical
- **Note**: These terms appear minimally in the author's text but are essential background:

  **Buddhist technical terms**:
  - **覺 (jue)**: Sanskrit **bodhi** (बोधि), awakening/enlightenment
  - **悟 (wu)**: realization, insight (often used in Chan for sudden awakening, Japanese **satori**)
  - **覺悟**: compound meaning awakening-realization, the process or event of enlightenment

  **Chinese translation history**:
  - Kumarajiva: used 覺 for bodhi, emphasizing awakening aspect
  - Xuanzang: used 覺 for bodhi, 悟 for pratipatti (realization through practice)
  - Chan tradition: 悟 becomes central (頓悟 sudden awakening, 漸悟 gradual awakening)

  **Author's non-usage**: The author avoids these terms, using instead 清醒 (lucid) and 承認 (recognition/acknowledgment). This is deliberate—avoiding Buddhist technical vocabulary while arriving at structurally similar insights. When discussing "what Chan calls 悟," use "awakening."

  **Translation rationale**: When these terms appear in explanatory/comparative contexts (discussing Buddhist parallels), use "awakening" (覺) and "realization" (悟). Maintain distinction from the author's 清醒 (lucid).

---

## 恒常

- **Main translation**: "constancy"
- **Alternatives**:
  - "permanence" only when ontological claim is explicit
  - "stability" when emphasizing functional continuity
- **Note**: 恒常 (heng chang) = enduring-constant. The author identifies this as "the core of metaphysics" (形而上学的核心是恒常):

  **Buddhist contrast: anitya** (無常, impermanence):
  - **Sanskrit anitya → Chinese 無常**: The first of three marks of existence (trilaksana)
  - **Buddhist teaching**: Taking the impermanent as permanent (於無常執常) is one of the four cognitive inversions (viparyasa/顛倒)
  - **Satipatthana Sutta**: Observe arising and passing (samudaya-vaya) in all phenomena

  **Author's analysis**: "We need to find (pursue) a constancy (恒常) within changing phenomena, so that we can intentionally perform any action with results meaningful to us." Constancy is a "guarantee" (保證) that same phenomena will REPEAT. This pursuit is non-rational but necessary.

  **Key difference**: Buddhism identifies pursuit of permanence as rooted in **avidya** (ignorance/無明) to be OVERCOME. The author identifies pursuit of constancy as non-rational feature to be RECOGNIZED (承認) and worked with lucidly, not eliminated. This is a different soteriological stance—post-metaphysical constancy-seeking rather than cessation of constancy-seeking.

  **Translation rationale**: "Constancy" better than "permanence" (which sounds like Buddhist 常/nitya as metaphysical claim). The author's 恒常 is about pursuit of repeatability and stability, not assertion of permanent essences. Avoid "invariance" (too mathematical) and "persistence" (too weak).

---

## 无常

- **Main translation**: "impermanence"
- **Alternatives**:
  - "impermanent" (adjectival)
  - "transience" when poetic tone is appropriate
- **Note**: **Buddhist technical term**:
  - **Sanskrit anitya → Chinese 無常**: Fundamental teaching across all Buddhist schools
  - **Three marks of existence** (trilaksana/三法印): All conditioned phenomena are impermanent (anicca/無常), suffering (dukkha/苦), non-self (anatta/無我)

  The author's text does not use 无常 frequently, focusing instead on 恒常 (constancy) as the metaphysical drive. The absence is notable—the author approaches from the phenomenology of our pursuit of stability rather than asserting impermanence as ontological truth.

  **Translation rationale**: Use "impermanence" (noun) or "impermanent" (adjective) for 無常 when discussing Buddhist doctrine. Maintain contrast with author's 恒常 (constancy).

---

## 我

- **Main translation**: "I," "self," "me" (depending on grammatical context)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "the I" when discussing 我 as concept/object of analysis
  - "ego" only in psychoanalytic contexts (avoid Buddhist conflation)
- **Note**: The author provides a formal definition: "'I' is that feeling, the feeling that whenever you mention any aspect related to me, it causes me to associate—that feeling is me." Formally: "I" is the universal property (terminal object) of a subcategory whose objects are all experiences related to me.

  **Buddhist anatman** (無我, non-self):
  - **Sanskrit anatman/anatta → Chinese 無我**: No permanent, unchanging, independent self
  - **Milindapanha's chariot analogy**: "Self" is a designation for the five aggregates (skandha/蘊), not a substance
  - **Nagarjuna (MMK 18)**: The self cannot be found among the aggregates, yet functions as conventional designation

  **Remarkable convergence**: The author's category-theoretic definition—self as structural position (universal property) in network of associations, not substance—IS the Middle Way on self:
  - NOT eternalism: there IS a "feeling of I," it's experienceable, not nothing
  - NOT nihilism: no self-substance; "I" is terminal object in subcategory, constituted by relations

  **Translation rationale**: Use "I" for 我 in most contexts. Use "the I" or "the self" when 我 is discussed as philosophical concept. Avoid "ego" (Freudian baggage) and "atman" (Hindu concept that Buddhism rejects).

---

## 无我

- **Main translation**: "non-self" (philosophical), "selflessness" (ethical)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "no-self" when emphasizing negation
  - "anatman" (untranslated) when Sanskrit reference is critical
- **Note**: **Core Buddhist doctrine**:
  - **Sanskrit anatman → Chinese 無我**: Denial of permanent, unchanging, independent self (atman)
  - Across all schools: No entity that is permanent (常), unitary (一), independent (自在), controller (主宰)

  The author rarely uses 无我 explicitly, but the category-theoretic definition of 我 (as universal property, not substance) functionally embodies the anatman teaching. The author arrives at non-self through formal analysis rather than Buddhist practice.

  **Translation rationale**: Use "non-self" for 無我 in Buddhist contexts. The author's framework achieves non-self structurally without using the term.

---

## 感受 / 受

- **Main translation**: "feeling" (感受), "vedana" or "feeling-tone" (受)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "experience" when broader than affective tone
  - "sensation" when emphasizing sensory origin
- **Note**: The author uses 感受 extensively as foundational category. In the footnote: "感受 has two meanings: (1) received information, i.e., stimuli; (2) the 'crystallization,' 'surge,' 'turbulence' that these construct. The second kind is also 感受."

  **Buddhist vedana** (受):
  - **Sanskrit vedana → Chinese 受**: One of five aggregates (skandha/蘊)
  - **Buddhist definition**: Affective tone (pleasant/unpleasant/neutral) arising from contact (phassa/觸)
  - **Dependent origination**: Contact → feeling → craving (vedana → tanha)
  - **Satipatthana**: Mindfulness of feelings (vedananupassana) is crucial practice

  **Author's usage**: 感受 is more comprehensive than Buddhist 受. The author states: "feelings exist prior to the concept of I" (感受存在于我的概念之先)—this aligns with Buddhist teaching that vedana is part of five aggregates (including feeling) that PRECEDE any reified self. But the author's 感受 includes what Buddhism would categorize across multiple aggregates (vedana, sañña/想/perception, sankhara/行/volitions).

  **Translation rationale**: Translate 感受 as "feeling" or "experience" depending on context. When discussing Buddhist parallels, note that author's 感受 is broader than Buddhist vedana (受) but includes it. Use "feeling" for both to maintain continuity, with footnotes clarifying scope.

---

## 现象

- **Main translation**: "phenomena" (plural), "phenomenon" (singular)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "appearance" when emphasizing how things show up
  - "what appears" (discursive)
- **Note**: The author defines P (phenomena) as "第一實在" (First Reality): what is directly encountered, cannot be doubted. All metaphysical constructions are based ON phenomena.

  **Buddhist dharma** (法):
  - **Sanskrit dharma → Chinese 法**: Phenomena, elements of existence, experiential constituents
  - **Pali dhamma**: In Theravada, the ultimate constituents of experience
  - **Abhidharma**: Catalogs dharmas (mental factors, physical factors, etc.)

  **Key distinction**:
  - **Buddhist 法/dharma**: Analytical categories of experience (including mental factors)
  - **Author's 现象/phenomena**: What is given prior to interpretation, closer to Pali **paccakkha** (directly experienced)
  - **Husserlian phenomenology**: Author's usage has resonances but is distinct—less transcendental ego focus

  **Author's critical move**: Phenomena (第一實在) are epistemologically prior. Any "objective world" (客觀世界) is a model GENERATED FROM phenomena (第二實在). This is almost precisely the Yogacara position that 境 is vijnapti-matra (唯識所現, appearance-only).

  **Translation rationale**: Use "phenomena" for 现象. Add translator's note distinguishing from Husserlian phenomenology (bracketing, transcendental ego) and from Buddhist dharma (analytical categories). The author's phenomena are the given experiential basis, not analyzable elements or noumena-behind-appearances.

---

## 缘起

- **Main translation**: "dependent origination"
- **Alternatives**:
  - "conditioned arising" (more literal)
  - "interdependent co-arising" (when emphasizing mutuality)
- **Note**: **Central Buddhist doctrine**:
  - **Sanskrit pratityasamutpada → Chinese 緣起**: The teaching that all phenomena arise in dependence on conditions (pratyaya/緣)
  - **Nagarjuna (MMK 24.18)**: "Whatever is dependently arisen, that we call emptiness"
  - **Formula**: "When this exists, that comes to be; with the arising of this, that arises" (此有故彼有，此生故彼生)

  **Author's implicit embodiment**: Though the term 缘起 doesn't appear frequently, the author's CORE MOVE embodies it:

  > "Rather than exploring 'the essence of things' as an inward direction, a more practical orientation is to explore 'the position of things' as an outward (relational) direction... In practice, the exploration of internal essence is 'impossible' because any exploration of internal essence will ultimately convert into an exploration of its external extensions."

  This is FORMAL EXPRESSION of pratityasamutpada: things are constituted by relations, not by svabhava (self-nature). In category theory, objects are defined by morphisms—this is the **Yoneda lemma**, which the author implicitly invokes. Buddhist equivalent: a dharma is constituted entirely by conditions and relations.

  **Hua-yen resonance**: The tower structure (morphisms are themselves objects with morphisms) resonates with Hua-yen (華嚴, Avatamsaka) doctrine of **shishi wuai** (事事無礙, interpenetration). Fa-zang's (法藏) Indra's net metaphor—each jewel reflects all others infinitely—is precisely tower-like.

  **Translation rationale**: Use "dependent origination" for 緣起. When discussing author's relational/categorical approach, note this is formal expression of dependent origination without using Buddhist terminology.

---

## 自性

- **Main translation**: "self-nature," "inherent existence"
- **Alternatives**:
  - "intrinsic nature" when emphasizing inherent qualities
  - "svabhava" (untranslated) when Sanskrit reference is critical
- **Note**: **Key term in Madhyamaka**:
  - **Sanskrit svabhava → Chinese 自性**: Self-nature, own-being, inherent existence
  - **Nagarjuna's target**: Svabhava is what Madhyamaka REJECTS. No phenomena have svabhava—all are empty (śūnya) of inherent existence.
  - **Definition**: Svabhava would be existence that is: (1) not dependent on causes/conditions, (2) unchanging, (3) not dependent on conceptual imputation

  **Author's parallel**: The author rejects "internal essences" in favor of relational definition. This recapitulates the Buddhist rejection of svabhava WITHOUT using the term. From 范畴论与境:

  > "Any exploration of internal essence will ultimately convert into an exploration of its external extensions."

  Category theory: objects are defined by morphisms (external relations), not internal content. Two objects are "the same" (isomorphic) iff they have same morphisms to/from all other objects. This IS the rejection of svabhava—essence is relational, not intrinsic.

  **Translation rationale**: Use "self-nature" or "inherent existence" for 自性 in Buddhist contexts. When discussing the author's rejection of internal essence, note this parallels rejection of svabhava but uses category-theoretic rather than Buddhist language.

---

## 实在

- **Main translation**: "reality" (with ordinal prefix when specified: 第一實在 = First Reality)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "what is real" (discursive)
  - "the real" (when discussing as philosophical category)
- **Note**: The author's three-level framework:
  - **第一實在** (First Reality): phenomena as directly encountered. Cannot be doubted. Starting point.
  - **第二實在** (Second Reality): interpretations, models, concepts built upon phenomena. The "objective world." All metaphysical constructions.
  - **第〇實在** (Zeroth Reality): putative "ultimate reality" behind phenomena. Author's claim: "When we propose 第〇實在, the very thing we propose BECOMES 第二實在."

  **Buddhist two truths** (二諦):
  - **Samvrti-satya** (世俗諦, conventional truth): ordinary language, concepts, practical engagement
  - **Paramartha-satya** (勝義諦, ultimate truth): emptiness, absence of inherent existence

  **Comparison**:
  - Author's 第一實在 (phenomena) = basis for both Buddhist truths, not itself either truth
  - Author's 第二實在 (constructions) ≈ samvrti-satya (conventional truth)
  - Author's 第〇實在 (inaccessible ultimate) ≠ paramartha-satya (which IS accessible in Madhyamaka through prajna)

  **Critical divergence**: Madhyamaka's paramartha is NOT behind or below conventional—it IS the emptiness OF the conventional. Accessed not by going elsewhere but seeing THIS differently. Author's 第〇實在 is IN PRINCIPLE inaccessible (closer to Kant's noumenon). However, author's REASON for inaccessibility (articulation is already construction) resonates with Nagarjuna's teaching that ultimate truth transcends conceptual proliferation (prapanca/戲論).

  **Yogacara parallel**: Three-nature framework (**trisvabhava**/三性) maps more naturally:
  - **Parikalpita** (遍計所執性, imagined): ≈ aspects of 第二實在 with no phenomenal basis
  - **Paratantra** (依他起性, dependent): ≈ 第一實在 as dependently arisen flow
  - **Parinispanna** (圓成實性, consummate): ≈ 第〇實在, except this IS accessible through transformed consciousness (轉識成智)

  **Translation rationale**: Use "Reality" with capital R for 實在 when part of author's three-level system. Always include ordinal: "First Reality," "Second Reality," "Zeroth Reality." Note these are epistemic-structural levels, not degrees of ontological realness.

---

## 超越

- **Main translation**: "transcendence" (noun), "transcend" (verb)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "go beyond" (verb, discursive)
  - "surpass" when emphasizing overcoming
- **Note**: The author uses 超越 in specific technical sense: what lies beyond the bounds of a given 境界 (domain/bounds). From 范畴论与境:

  > "The transcendent (超越) is what exists. Even though any research object we propose must necessarily be within the bounds of thought (思想的境界), its material—'from WHERE do we propose these things?'—is given beforehand (此在, Dasein)."

  This is NOT metaphysical transcendence (Platonic forms, God, noumena) but phenomenological givenness. Heidegger's **Dasein** (此在, being-there) resonance is explicit. Transcendence is:
  1. The process of "putting into the basket" (what makes phenomena appear)
  2. Inaccessible DIRECTLY (beyond thought's bounds)
  3. Studied through its RESULT (phenomena) and EVOLUTION (change in phenomena)

  **Buddhist parallel**: This resembles but differs from discussion of what lies beyond conceptual elaboration (prapanca/戲論):
  - **Buddhist transcendence**: Liberation (nirvana) transcends samsara, yet MMK 25.19-20 states they are "not different"
  - **Author's transcendence**: The process by which phenomena arise for consciousness—studied through evolution functors, not mystical realization

  **Translation rationale**: Use "transcendence" (noun) and "transcend" (verb) for 超越. Add note distinguishing from metaphysical/theological transcendence. Author's usage is phenomenological—what lies beyond thought's current bounds but manifests through change.

---

## 诗意

- **Main translation**: "poeticality" (noun), "poetic" (adjective)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "the poetic stance" when emphasizing orientation
  - "poetic engagement" when emphasizing activity
- **Note**: The author's original contribution. 诗意 (shi yi) = poetry-meaning/intent. The author defines this as the stance of **清醒的梦境** (lucid dreamscape):

  > "After metaphysics, facing meaning should be poetic (诗意). Because feeling already exists, we should not deny this meaning (such denial is false pride). Because Zeroth Reality has been disenchanted, we cannot be intoxicated within it. What remains is only to treat it as it is—that is, lucidly. This is the lucid dreamscape, which I call poeticality."

  This is the author's term for post-metaphysical engagement: knowing constructions are constructions, yet fully engaging with them.

  **Buddhist parallel**: While Buddhist terminology centers on **upaya** (方便, skillful means) and **karuna** (慈悲, compassion) as post-awakening stances, the author articulates the post-metaphysical stance as POETIC—creative, intentional engagement with constructed meaning. This is a genuinely novel articulation, not found in Buddhist sources.

  **Contrast**:
  - **沉醉** (intoxicated): pre-metaphysical/pre-awakening belief
  - **虚无** (nihilistic void): post-metaphysical collapse without reconstruction
  - **诗意** (poetic): post-metaphysical lucid engagement—the third way

  **Translation rationale**: Use "poeticality" (noun) or "poetic" (adjective) for 诗意. This is technical term in the author's framework. Avoid "poetry" (too narrow—not about verse) and "aesthetic" (too broad—not just beauty). "Poetic" captures: (1) creative construction, (2) self-aware artifice, (3) full emotional engagement, (4) meaningful despite constructed nature.

## 德

- **Main translation**: "virtue" (moral contexts), "potency" or "efficacy" (Daoist contexts)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "de" (untranslated) when specifically referencing Daoist technical term
  - "power" when emphasizing effective capacity
- **Note**: 德 (de) is complex term with different meanings in Confucian vs. Daoist traditions:

  **Confucian 德**: Moral virtue, cultivated character (仁義禮智 are aspects of 德)

  **Daoist 德**:
  - In **Laozi**: The manifestation/function of Dao (道). "Dao generates, De nurtures" (道生之，德畜之)
  - Not moral virtue but natural efficacy, the power/potency by which things are what they are
  - Author's example: "What makes a human human" = 人德 (human-de)

  **Author's usage**: In discussing the 道德仁義禮 hierarchy, the author uses 德 in Daoist sense—the "operating principle" of a category of things. 人德 (human-de) = what makes humans function as humans = 仁 (ren, humaneness).

  **Buddhist parallel**: While Buddhism lacks direct equivalent, **svabhava** (自性, self-nature) serves similar role—what makes X be X. But Madhyamaka REJECTS svabhava; the author's 德 is relational/functional, not essential, so closer to Buddhist rejection of svabhava.

  **Translation rationale**: Context-dependent:
  - Confucian moral contexts: "virtue"
  - Daoist cosmological contexts: "potency" or "efficacy"
  - Author's usage in 道德仁義禮 example: "efficacy" or leave as "de" with note
  - Avoid "power" (too political) in most contexts

---

## 道

- **Main translation**: "Dao" (untranslated with note)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "the Way" (traditional translation)
  - "the Dao" (with definite article)
- **Note**: 道 (dao) is central concept in Daoist philosophy, extremely difficult to translate:

  **Laozi's Daodejing opening**: "The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao" (道可道，非常道)

  **Traditional meanings**:
  - Literally: road, path, way
  - Philosophically: the source/pattern of all things, the ultimate principle, the nameless origin

  **Author's analysis**: In discussing 失道而后德 (lose Dao, then De), the author shows how 道 is:
  1. Formally positioned as "most above" (形而上) in traditional metaphysics
  2. Actually GENERATED from below (from phenomena upward through abstraction)
  3. The author's footnote: "道 is like the canvas for a painting"—what allows existence to exist

  This parallels the author's 第〇實在 (Zeroth Reality): when articulated, it becomes 第二實在 (construction). True Dao is unspeakable (不可道).

  **Buddhist parallel**:
  - Similar to dharma-kaya (法身, Dharma-body) or tathata (真如, suchness)—ultimate reality beyond conceptualization
  - But Buddhism emphasizes THIS is accessible through non-conceptual wisdom; author emphasizes inaccessibility through articulation

  **Translation rationale**: Leave as "Dao" (untranslated) with note explaining concept. "The Way" is acceptable but less precise. Capitalize to indicate technical term. When discussing author's analysis of 道德仁義禮, explain the formal/generative reversal rather than trying to capture 道 in single English word.

## 形而上

- **Main translation**: "the metaphysical" (as category of content)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "that which is above form" (literal, for emphasis)
  - "metaphysical constructions" when emphasizing constructed nature
- **Note**: **Critical distinction** from 形而上學 (metaphysics as discipline):

  **形而上** (xing er shang) = the metaphysical, that which is above form
  - Source: Yijing (易經) Xi Ci Zhuan: "That which is above form is called Dao; that which is below form is called vessel/tool (器)"
  - Author's usage: Any interpretive structure built upon phenomena (形/現象)
  - Examples: concepts, categories, theories, value systems—all 第二實在 (Second Reality)

  **形而上學** (xing er shang xue) = metaphysics, the study of the metaphysical
  - Translation of "metaphysics"
  - The discipline/inquiry into ultimate reality, first principles

  **Author's framework**:
  - **前形而上學** (pre-metaphysics): treats 第〇實在 as actually existent foundation
  - **虚無** (nihilistic void): after metaphysics collapses
  - **后形而上學** (post-metaphysics): recognizes all 形而上 are constructions upon phenomena, yet functional and necessary

  **Translation rationale**:
  - 形而上 → "the metaphysical" (note: as category, not discipline)
  - 形而上學 → "metaphysics" (the discipline)
  - Add note explaining literal meaning ("above form") and that author treats phenomena (形) as ground, reversing traditional "Dao generates form" model
  - When distinction is unclear, use context: "metaphysical [constructions/concepts]" vs. "metaphysics [as inquiry]"

---

## 非理性

- **Main translation**: "non-rational"
- **Alternatives**:
  - "arational" when emphasizing neither rational nor irrational
  - "beyond reason" (discursive)
- **Note**: The author's crucial move in post-metaphysics:

  > "Obviously, the purpose of reason must lie outside reason... Therefore, the purpose of reason must be non-rational—that is to say, reason exists merely as a tool. Therefore, we naturally know that **the pursuit of ultimate reality itself is non-rational** (metaphysics itself is non-rational)."

  And critically:

  > "The reason metaphysics and nihilism are non-rational is because our **pursuit** of the metaphysical is non-rational... This non-rationality should be **acknowledged** (承認)."

  **Not irrationality** (against reason) but **non-rationality** (outside reason's scope). The pursuit of constancy, meaning, purpose is not rationally justified but is irreducible feature of human existence.

  **Buddhist parallel**: Buddhism identifies **tanha** (渴愛, craving) as root of suffering—an affective-volitional force, not rational choice. However:
  - **Buddhism**: Aims to OVERCOME tanha through path (cessation)
  - **Author**: Aims to RECOGNIZE non-rational drives and work with them lucidly (poeticality)

  Different soteriological orientation: author proposes "lucid constancy-seeking" rather than "cessation of constancy-seeking."

  **Translation rationale**: Use "non-rational" (not "irrational"). "Irrational" implies deficiency or pathology; "non-rational" indicates outside reason's domain. Avoid "a-rational" (too technical). When discussing Buddhism, note Buddhism treats similar drives (tanha, upadana/執取) as to be overcome, while author treats as to be recognized and engaged lucidly.

---

## 承认

- **Main translation**: "recognize," "acknowledge"
- **Alternatives**:
  - "admit" when emphasizing acceptance of difficult truth
  - "acknowledgment" (noun)
- **Note**: 承認 (cheng ren) = bear-recognize, acknowledge. This is KEY TERM in author's post-metaphysics:

  > "This non-rationality should be **acknowledged** (承認)."
  >
  > "Because feeling already exists, we should not deny this meaning (such denial is false pride虛妄)."

  Acknowledgment (承認) is the pivot from nihilism to poeticality:
  1. Acknowledge non-rationality of meaning-seeking
  2. Acknowledge feelings/meanings already exist (before we can choose)
  3. Acknowledge constructions are constructions
  4. Engage lucidly rather than denying or being intoxicated

  **Buddhist parallel**: Similar to **yatha-bhuta** (如實, as it really is) knowledge in Buddhism—seeing things as they are. But:
  - **Buddhist 如實知**: Seeing impermanence, suffering, non-self as they are → liberation
  - **Author's 承認**: Recognizing non-rationality, constructedness, inescapability → lucid engagement

  Different endpoints: liberation vs. poetic engagement.

  **Translation rationale**: Use "acknowledge" or "recognize" for 承認. "Acknowledge" better captures the acceptance dimension (not just knowing but accepting). Avoid "accept" alone (too passive), "confess" (too religious), "recognize" alone (too neutral).

## 第〇实在 / 第一实在 / 第二实在

- **Main translation**:
  - 第〇實在 = "Zeroth Reality"
  - 第一實在 = "First Reality"
  - 第二實在 = "Second Reality"
- **Alternatives**: None—maintain the numbering system
- **Note**: See extensive discussion under **實在** above. Key points:

  **Numbering is epistemic-structural, NOT ontological**:
  - NOT "degrees of realness"
  - Indicates: accessibility, constructedness, epistemic priority

  **First Reality** (第一實在) = phenomena:
  - Epistemologically prior (cannot be doubted without losing ground)
  - Given before interpretation
  - The basis for all constructions

  **Second Reality** (第二實在) = constructions:
  - Interpretations, models, concepts built on phenomena
  - Includes "objective world" as model
  - All metaphysical structures

  **Zeroth Reality** (第〇實在) = putative ultimate:
  - Would be "behind" or "before" phenomena
  - Author's claim: In principle inaccessible—articulation makes it Second Reality
  - Parallel to Kant's noumenon, Laozi's unspoken Dao

  **Translation rationale**:
  - Always translate with full phrase: "First Reality" (not "first reality" or "the first reality")
  - Capitalize Reality to indicate technical term
  - Include translator's note on first occurrence explaining the numbering is NOT ontological hierarchy
  - The zero/first/second order is counterintuitive (zero comes after first epistemically) but matches author's mathematical thinking (0-indexed, like programming)

## Additional Notes on Translation Strategy

### Sanskrit → Chinese → English Chains

When Buddhist terms appear in comparative/explanatory contexts, include the full chain:

**Example**: "The author's rejection of internal essences parallels the Madhyamaka rejection of **svabhava** (Sanskrit स्वभाव → Chinese 自性 → 'self-nature' or 'inherent existence')."

Key chains to maintain:
- **pratityasamutpada** (प्रतीत्यसमुत्पाद) → 緣起 → dependent origination
- **śūnyatā** (शून्यता) → 空 → emptiness
- **anatman** (अनात्मन्) → 無我 → non-self
- **bodhi** (बोधि) → 覺 → awakening
- **vedana** (वेदना) → 受 → feeling

### Kumarajiva vs. Xuanzang Translation Traditions

Note major differences when relevant:

- **Kumarajiva** (鳩摩羅什, 344-413): Emphasized literary elegance, sometimes free translation, introduced 空 for śūnyatā
- **Xuanzang** (玄奘, 602-664): Emphasized precision, more literal, established Yogacara terminology

When author's usage echoes one tradition, note it (e.g., author's 境 usage closer to Kumarajiva's visaya rendering).

### The Author's Usage vs. Buddhist Technical Meanings

ALWAYS distinguish when terms have Buddhist technical meanings:

**Pattern**: "[Author's term] resonates with Buddhist [technical term], but [key difference]."

**Example**: "清醒的梦境 (lucid dreamscape) parallels Chan awakening, but where Buddhist 覺 aims at liberation from suffering (dukkha-nirodha), the author's 清醒 is epistemological recognition of constructedness without soteriological goal."

### Terms to Keep Untranslated

Consider keeping untranslated (with note) when:
- No adequate English equivalent exists (Dao, dharma in specialized contexts)
- Buddhist technical precision is critical (bodhi, pratityasamutpada in scholarly contexts)
- Author deliberately uses as technical term (境 as "E" in formal passages)

### Translator's Notes

Essential translator's notes on first occurrence:

1. **境 (E/Scape)**: Buddhist background (visaya/gocara), why "realm" insufficient, author's categorical formalization
2. **虚无 vs. 空**: Critical distinction between author's nihilism and Buddhist emptiness
3. **清醒的梦境**: Parallel to Chan awakening, but different soteriology
4. **第〇/第一/第二實在**: Numbering is epistemic, not ontological; relationship to Buddhist two truths
5. **诗意**: Author's original term for post-metaphysical stance
