**Draft:** DRAFT-R1
**Date:** 2026-02-13

## Overall Assessment

**Rating: Good**

The translation preserves the exploratory tone and philosophical content. Key terms are handled correctly per the dictionary.

## Buddhist Resonances (Confirmations)

1. **"Effective existence" (有效存在)**: Excellent choice. This parallels Buddhist *saṃvṛti-sat* (conventional existence) — things are real at their level without requiring ultimate ontological ground. The TN clarifies "not 'merely apparent' but 'genuinely operative at that scale'" — this is precisely the Buddhist position on conventional truth.

2. **Emergence/Renormalization**: The ocean/molecules analogy resonates with dependent origination (*pratītyasamutpāda*) — macro patterns arise from micro interactions without being reducible to them or floating free of them. The "continuous across different scales" point strengthens this.

3. **Empathy from individuality**: The argument that we understand others *because* we are individuals (not despite it) parallels Buddhist teaching — Buddha-nature is found in the particular, not by escaping particularity. Awakening doesn't dissolve the individual; it transforms how individuality is inhabited.

4. **Footnote [^1]**: "It is only by standing upon oneself that transcending oneself can be defined at all" — this is excellent. Parallels the Mahāyāna insight that nirvana is found *through* samsara, not apart from it.

## Translation Choices — Confirmed

- **重整化 → "renormalization"**: Correct. The TN is essential and well-written.
- **有效存在 → "effective existence"**: Correct. Physics meaning preserved.
- **良定义 → "well-defined"**: Standard mathematical usage, appropriate.
- **超越 → "transcendence" / "to transcend"**: Per dictionary, correct.

## Minor Observations

1. The parenthetical "(in the way mathematics does)" appears twice — this is the author's original phrasing and should be preserved as it signals his constructivist position on mathematical realism.

2. The question box about human nature (性) is preserved — good. This connects to later essays and the 德 analysis.

## No Issues Requiring Changes

The draft is ready for editorial review.
