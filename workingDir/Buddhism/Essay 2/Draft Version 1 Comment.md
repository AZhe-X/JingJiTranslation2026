# Draft Version 1 Comment — Buddhism Advisor

**Essay:** Essay 2 — A Thought on Knowledge
**Draft:** DRAFT-R1 (Author's Original English)
**Date:** 2026-02-13

## Overall Assessment

**Rating: Good**

The minimal apparatus approach is correct — this is the author's original English and should be preserved verbatim. The single Translator's Note is appropriate and well-placed.

## On the Translator's Note

The TN correctly:
- Identifies the essay as author's original English
- Connects "phenomena" to Chinese 现象
- Frames the essay within the collection's framework
- Notes this essay provides "epistemological groundwork"

No changes needed to the TN.

## Buddhist Resonances (For Reader's Background)

This essay independently arrives at positions strikingly parallel to Buddhist epistemology (*pramāṇavāda*):

1. **Access-focused epistemology**: The author's argument that "we have direct access to phenomena" but not to truth mirrors Dignāga's restriction of valid cognition to perception (*pratyakṣa*) and inference (*anumāna*) — both operating within the phenomenal domain.

2. **The "digestion" problem**: The author's observation that phenomena must be "converted into thoughts" before serving as justification precisely parallels the Buddhist distinction between *pratyakṣa* (concept-free perception) and *anumāna* (conceptual inference). The moment we think about perception, we've moved to inference.

3. **Practical truth criterion**: The author's conclusion that knowledge = "what is believed to be correct" parallels Dharmakīrti's *arthakriyā* criterion — valid cognition defined by practical success, not correspondence to things-in-themselves.

4. **Dissolution of JTB**: The reduction of all justification bases to belief echoes Buddhist critiques of foundationalism developed in debates with Nyāya.

These parallels are not coincidental — they emerge from a shared commitment to phenomenological rigor and epistemic humility.

## Optional Consideration

The current TN is appropriately minimal. If the editors wish, a brief note in the collection's introduction could mention that readers familiar with Buddhist epistemology will recognize parallels with *pramāṇa* theory — but this need not appear in the essay-level apparatus.

## No Issues Requiring Changes

The draft is ready for editorial review.
