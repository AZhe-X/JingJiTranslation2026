### #10 — 道德仁義禮 Inversion

**Question:** Does the author's analysis (禮→仁/義→德→道) foreclose Confucian ontological claims about 仁's priority, or merely bracket them?

**Resolution:** The framework **brackets rather than forecloses** ontological claims.

**Key Evidence:** The author explicitly offers three interpretations in the 范畴论与境 opening:
1. Structure IS essence
2. Structure REPRESENTS essence  
3. Both together

The author declines to choose between them, saying only that *in practice* we can only access structure.

**Consensus:** All advisors agreed. Metaphysics Advisor withdrew initial concern after identifying this explicit agnosticism in the text.

**Implication for Translation:** The 道德仁義禮 analysis describes *order of knowing* (epistemological) without making claims about *order of being* (ontological). Compatible with traditions that hold ontological commitments about what grounds structure.

**Buddhist Parallel:** This mirrors Buddhist conventional/ultimate distinction — structural analysis operates at saṃvṛti level without foreclosing paramārtha questions.
