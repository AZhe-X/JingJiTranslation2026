## Topic #10: 道德仁義禮 Inversion

**Question:** Is the author right about epistemology (how we learn concepts) but missing ontology (what's metaphysically prior)?

**Key tension:** Author argues 禮(observed) → 仁/義(interpretation) → 德 → 道. Tradition holds 道 → 德 → 仁 → 義 → 禮. Does the framework foreclose or bracket the Confucian ontological claim that 仁 is prior?

**Discussion summary:**
- Chinese Philosophy opened: revised position that author may describe *order of knowing* while leaving *order of being* open
- Kantian: Footnote 25 explicitly brackets ontology ("只是名称，而不是本体论上具有实在地位的论断")
- Metaphysics dissented: anti-essentialism (structural position exhausts essence) seems to foreclose ontological priority
- Wittgenstein: definition describes how concepts *function* (meaning is use), not what they ARE in themselves
- Buddhism: parallels Buddhist conventional/ultimate distinction
- Epistemology: even if not foreclosed, an ontologically prior 仁 becomes "epistemically idle"

**Resolution:**
Metaphysics withdrew concern after re-reading the opening of 范畴论与境, which explicitly offers three interpretations:
1. Structure IS essence
2. Structure REPRESENTS essence  
3. Both together

The author declines to choose between them, saying only that *in practice* we can only access structure.

**Consensus (9/0):** The framework **brackets** rather than forecloses ontological questions. The 道德仁義禮 analysis is compatible with Confucian claims about 仁's ontological priority.

**Implication for translation:** Translate the passage as epistemological claim about concept-acquisition; no need to add disclaimers about ontology since the framework already brackets it.
