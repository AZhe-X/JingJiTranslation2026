# Draft Version 1 Comment — Wittgenstein Advisor

**Essay:** Sisyphus, Work, and the Cat (Essay 3)
**Draft:** R1
**Reviewed:** 2026-02-13

## Overall Assessment

**Rating: Good**

The translation preserves the experiential sequence that performs the dissolution of absurdity. The key philosophy of language insight — that the cat owner never needs to *articulate* meaning — comes through clearly.

## Philosophy of Language Observations

### Strengths

1. **"Immanent meaning" (内生的意义):** Excellent choice. "Immanent" captures both the internal source and the non-transcendent character. The contrast with externally sought meaning is clear.

2. **"Dissonance" / "off-tone" / "misalignment":** The translation preserves the author's own gloss ("off-tone") in context while using "dissonance" as the main term. This captures the mismatch character without over-technicalizing.

3. **The unarticulated meaning:** The key sentence — "we do not even need to explicitly, rationally articulate this meaning; we naturally feel satisfaction" — is Wittgensteinian to the core. Meaning is in the practice, not in a propositional statement about the practice. The translation preserves this perfectly.

4. **The experiential sequence preserved:** Sisyphus → worker → entrepreneur → cat is not illustration but philosophical argument conducted in the register of experience. Each step dissolves more of the problematic: heroic revolt → reframing as self-employment → simple engagement without the question arising. The draft maintains this progression faithfully.

### The Translator's Notes

**TN1** (班): Appropriate. Explains the title's three-part structure and why "work" is better than "labor" or "toil" — the everyday, non-heroic quality matters.

**TN2** (cat example): Correctly identifies the philosophical crux without over-explaining. The cat owner "never encounters absurdity at all" — this is the dissolution, not resolution, of the Camusian problematic. The note flags significance without interrupting the experiential sequence.

### Minor Observation (Not a Change Request)

The final line — "simply because we want to raise a cat, we like living with a cat, and that is all" — echoes Wittgenstein's "This is simply what I do" (PI §217). The parallel is implicit and should remain so; making it explicit would over-theorize.

## Recommendation

**Approve for R2.** No changes needed from my domain.
