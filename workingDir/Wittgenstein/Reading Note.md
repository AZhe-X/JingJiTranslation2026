# Reading Notes — Wittgenstein Advisor

## 1. 关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一

**Core question:** Does "collective interest" refer to anything real, or is it merely shorthand for aggregated individual interests?

**Philosophy of language observations:**

1. **The reference problem:** The essay opens by questioning whether "collective interest" (集体利益) has a referent. This is the classic problem of abstract singular terms — does "the collective" name anything?

2. **Renormalization as semantic strategy:** The author resolves this by analogy to physics: macro-level concepts (collective interest) are "renormalized" from micro-level phenomena (individual interests). The key move is claiming these emergent concepts are "well-defined" (良定义 — borrowed from mathematical usage). This isn't dissolution of the problem but a positive claim about how reference works at different scales.

3. **The question reframed:** "在宏观层面上，群体能否被当作一个整体来认知?" — Can the group be *cognized as* a whole at the macro level? This shifts from ontology to epistemology, but the author treats successful cognition as evidence for "effective existence" (有效存在).

4. **The ocean analogy:** Water molecules vs. waves. The author claims wave-patterns are "objectively existing like mathematics" (像是数学一样的"客观"存在). The scare quotes around "客观" are telling — there's some hedging here.

5. **Standpoint constraint:** Humans can only understand from their individual standpoint. Empathy (共情) works *because* we share the same scale of existence. A collective couldn't empathize with individuals any more than we empathize with our cells.

6. **Footnote 1 is crucial:** "只有立足自身，超越自身才有所定义" — Only by standing on oneself can "transcending oneself" be defined. This is a meta-linguistic observation: the *meaning* of transcendence is parasitic on having a standpoint to transcend from.

**Terms to track:**
- 有效存在 (effective existence)
- 重整化 (renormalization)
- 良定义 (well-defined)
- 现象 (phenomenon — used technically)

**Translation concerns:**
- "重整化" is borrowed from physics. The English "renormalization" carries specific technical baggage. Does the author want that baggage, or a looser "emergence" reading?
- "良定义" is mathematical jargon. "Well-defined" is the standard translation, but loses the etymological clarity of 良 (good/proper).

## 2. A Thought on Knowledge

**Core move:** Disassembling the classical definition of knowledge (justified true belief) by asking what actually happens in epistemic practice.

**Philosophy of language observations:**

1. **Use vs. definition:** The author's method is Wittgensteinian without naming it. Rather than debating definitions of "truth" or "justification," the author asks: what do we actually *do* when we justify a belief? How do we *use* the word "knowledge"?

2. **The inaccessibility of truth:** "In practice, we do not have direct access to truth; we have direct access to phenomena." This is the heart of the essay. The *truth condition* in "justified true belief" is methodologically unreachable. We can check beliefs against phenomena, not against truth itself. The rain example is perfect: we look outside and see what appears to be rain, but we cannot check whether it *really* is raining independent of all observation.

3. **Phenomena require digestion:** The author introduces a crucial mediating step — phenomena must be "converted into thoughts" (digestion) before they can serve as justification. This means even phenomena-based justification reduces to belief-based justification. The third Bob example (not noticing the rain at all) shows phenomena are not self-interpreting.

4. **Regress problem reframed:** If all justification rests on prior justified beliefs, we face regress. The author's resolution: in practice, "knowledge" just means "what each individual believes to be correct" (or what most people in a field believe to be correct). This is deflationary but pragmatically oriented.

5. **The concept in use:** "When we use the word 'knowledge,' there is nothing about truth in it." This is a claim about actual usage, not conceptual analysis. The word functions to mark beliefs we're confident about, not beliefs we've verified against truth.

**Key terms:**
- Phenomena (现象) — what we experience/observe
- Digestion — converting phenomena into beliefs
- Access — the central constraint on justification

**Connections to Essay 1:**
- Both essays pivot on the question of access: we can only access phenomena, not truth; we can only understand from our individual standpoint.
- "有效存在" (effective existence) in Essay 1 and "phenomena" here both name what we can actually work with.

**Translation concerns:**
- The essay is already in English, but the concept of "digestion" (for converting phenomena to belief) is non-standard terminology. This is author-specific vocabulary.
- "Phenomena" carries Husserlian connotations the author may not intend. The sidenote clarifies: "it refers to what we experience or observe" — a more ordinary-language reading.

## 3. 西西弗斯、班与猫

**Core argument:** The absurd arises from asking the wrong question — seeking meaning externally when meaning is internally generated.

**Philosophy of language observations:**

1. **The ill-formed question:** The author diagnoses absurdism as arising from a misframed question. Asking "What is the meaning of X?" where X is work, life, or the universe presupposes meaning could be found *out there*. This is a category mistake: looking for your watch where you never went.

2. **Meaning as internal generation:** "意义本身是由人的内在产生的，而非来自于外在" — meaning is produced from within, not received from without. This relocates the question of meaning from metaphysics to psychology/phenomenology. The question isn't "Does X have meaning?" but "Does X generate meaning for me?"

3. **The alienation analysis (异化):** The office worker feels absurd not because work is inherently meaningless but because the meaning has been *externalized* — he's working for something outside himself. When meaning is alienated, the "off-tone" (非和谐) appears. The entrepreneur doing what he loves faces the same material conditions but no absurdity, because meaning remains internal.

4. **The cat example — meaning without articulation:** "甚至我们都不需要明确的依靠理性把这个意义提出" — we don't need to rationally articulate the meaning of raising a cat to feel it. This is anti-intellectualist about meaning. Meaning can be lived without being stated. No one asks "What's the meaning of feeding the cat?" because the question never arises.

5. **超越性 (transcendence):** A key term. Sisyphus's rebellion is internally generated but directed *outward* against the gods (超越的外在存在). The cat example has no transcendence in either direction — no inward-generated transcendent goal, no outward-seeking. Just immanent satisfaction.

**Key terms:**
- 非和谐 (off-tone, dissonance)
- 异化 (alienation)
- 超越/超越性 (transcendence)
- 内化/外化 (internalization/externalization)

**Connections to previous essays:**
- Essay 1's constraint that we can only start from our individual standpoint echoes here: meaning must be generated from where we stand, not sought elsewhere.
- Essay 2's focus on access: we have access to internal meaning-generation, not to external meaning-bestowal.

**Translation concerns:**
- "非和谐" (off-tone) — the author uses a musical metaphor. "Dissonance" or "discord" are options, but lose the literal sense of "not-harmony."
- "异化" is the standard translation of Marx's "alienation" (Entfremdung). The Marxist resonance is deliberate.
- "超越性" — "transcendence" is standard but carries heavy metaphysical baggage. Context will need to clarify whether ontological or directional transcendence is meant.

## 4. 后形而上学 整理

**Core argument:** Traditional metaphysics inverts the order of generation — concepts (道德仁义礼) are actually *generated from* phenomena, but metaphysics presents them as *generating* phenomena. Post-metaphysics recognizes this inversion and re-grounds itself in phenomena.

**Philosophy of language observations:**

1. **The inversion diagnosis:** The author traces how 礼 (ritual behavior observed in phenomena) gets explained by 仁 (benevolence), abstracted to 德 (virtue), and finally to 道 (the Way). But then the *explanatory* order gets treated as the *generative* order: 道 generates 德 generates 仁 generates 礼. This is a claim about how language and concepts mislead us about their own origins.

2. **First and Second Reality:**
   - 第一实在 (First Reality) = phenomena, what we directly experience. Not a metaphysical claim about "realness" but about epistemic priority — this is where we *start*.
   - 第二实在 (Second Reality) = constructs we generate from phenomena, including "objects" like apples and abstract concepts.
   - There is no 第〇实在 (Zero-th Reality) we can access — the moment we posit it, it becomes Second Reality.

3. **The ladder of abstraction (形而上 types):**
   - Type 0: Basic recognition of sameness (this apple now = this apple a moment ago)
   - Type 1: Induction from repeated experience (apples always fall)
   - Type 2: Abstraction from inductions into concepts (诚信/honesty)
   - Type 3: Combination and formalization of concepts into frameworks (value systems)

4. **恒常 (constancy) as the core:** All metaphysics seeks *constancy* — something that remains the same across change. This is the "guarantee" we give ourselves: that same phenomena will recur. Without constancy, we have no "grip" (抓手) on phenomena and cannot act meaningfully.

5. **The non-rational foundation:** The pursuit of constancy is *non-rational* (非理性). Not irrational in the sense of bad reasoning, but prior to reason — reason is a tool that requires purposes outside itself. The author *acknowledges* rather than dismisses this non-rationality.

6. **Post-metaphysics defined:** Metaphysics that recognizes all 形而上 is constructed from 形 (phenomena) and keeps this awareness alive. It doesn't seek 第〇实在 but works with the overlay of ideal and phenomenon — *practice* (实践).

**Key terms:**
- 现象 / 第一实在 (phenomena / First Reality)
- 第二实在 (Second Reality)
- 恒常 (constancy)
- 形而上 vs. 形而上学 (metaphysical concepts vs. metaphysics as study)
- 非理性 (non-rational)
- 实践 (practice)

**Critical observation on terminology:**
The author explicitly warns: "许多名词和概念和哲学传统有差别，需要读者注意甄别以免混淆." This is not carelessness but intentional. The author is building a personal philosophical vocabulary. 现象 is not Husserlian phenomenology; 形而上 is not Aristotelian metaphysics; 第一实在 is not Cartesian "primary substances."

**Translation concerns:**
- "形而上" / "形而上学" — the distinction between *metaphysical (adj/noun)* and *metaphysics (discipline)* is harder to mark in English.
- "恒常" — "constancy" works, but the author invests this term with specific meaning (the guarantee of recurrence).
- "非理性" — "non-rational" is better than "irrational," since the author doesn't mean *bad reasoning* but *prior to reason*.
- "第一/第二实在" — "First/Second Reality" is literal but risks ontological misreading. The author explicitly notes these are names, not claims about what is "really real."

## 5. 形而上学后的目的：诗意

**Core argument:** After metaphysics has been "disenchanted," meaning and purpose don't disappear — they must be engaged with *poetically*, in full awareness that they are dream-constructs we cannot not have.

**Philosophy of language observations:**

1. **The naming problem:** The author cannot find a precise name for 梦境 (dreamscape): "我难以想出一个更加确切的名称." Alternatives offered: game, book, adventure, small world, small freedom. This difficulty is itself diagnostic — the concept resists a single term because it's meant to capture the *environment* in which meaning exists, which takes many forms.

2. **梦境 as context for meaning:** A 梦境 is not a dream (though that's the literal meaning) but the "environment" (环境) that makes certain meanings possible. Playing a game, the game-world is the 梦境 in which in-game achievements have meaning. The 梦境 is the frame, and meaning only exists within frames.

3. **Two modes of dreaming:**
   - 沉醉的梦境 (intoxicated dreamscape): We don't know we're in a dream. Meaning feels like *discovery* of something already there. This is *belief* or *faith* (信念/信仰).
   - 清醒的梦境 (lucid dreamscape): We know we're in a dream but engage fully anyway. This is *诗意* (the poetic). We play the game knowing it's a game — but play for real.

4. **Meaning and feeling as "two sides of one body":** "意义和感受即是两面一体" — this is a radical identification. Meaning is not *about* feeling; it *is* feeling, differently described. The 梦境 is the "packaging" (包装) that makes this experience possible.

5. **The impossibility of abandoning all dreamscapes:** One might want to reject all 梦境 — why engage? But this is impossible because we *already have* feelings, and feelings already constitute meaning. 梦境 is just a *description* of what already exists. You can't abandon feeling until you cease to exist.

6. **诗意 as the post-metaphysical stance:** After 第〇实在 has been disenchanted, we can neither deny meaning (虚妄 — hollow and presumptuous) nor lose ourselves in it (沉醉). The only path: engage with meaning *as such* — knowingly, fully, poetically.

**Key terms:**
- 梦境 (dreamscape)
- 诗意 (the poetic / poetic meaning)
- 沉醉的/清醒的 (intoxicated/lucid)
- 感受 (feeling — used in two senses: received stimulus; and the "crystallization" of stimuli into affect)
- 虚妄 (hollow-presumptuous — the author's coinage from middle school)

**Connections to previous essays:**
- Continues directly from Essay 4 (后形而上学)
- The anti-nihilist move mirrors Essay 3: we can't escape meaning any more than the cat-owner escapes meaning in feeding the cat.
- The 梦境 concept parallels Essay 2's "digestion" — meaning requires an interpretive frame.

**Translation concerns:**
- "梦境" — "dreamscape" captures the spatial metaphor but may over-literalize. "Dream-world" or "dream-frame" are alternatives.
- "诗意" — "the poetic" is the closest English equivalent, though it lacks the Chinese resonance with 意 (meaning/intent).
- "沉醉" — "intoxicated" or "immersed" — the metaphor is being drunk in the dream.
- "清醒" — "lucid" (as in lucid dreaming) fits perfectly.

## 6. 范畴论与境 整理

**Core project:** Using category theory to formalize how concepts and meaning are structured — not as essences but as positions in a relational structure.

**Philosophy of language observations:**

1. **Why category theory? The inward-to-outward move:**
   The essay opens with a philosophical justification: exploring the "internal essence" of something always converts into exploring its "external relations." The crucial analogy: "正如我们在语言的境界（界限）内，要界定一个词语的意思（内在的本质），我们不得不使用其他的语言（外在的延伸）。" — To define a word's meaning, we must use other words. Therefore, within the realm of language/thought, investigating structure *is* investigating essence.

   This is a deeply Wittgensteinian move, whether the author knows it or not. Meaning is use; meaning is position in a language-game; there is no private essence behind the public relations.

2. **P and E — Phenomena and Structure:**
   - $\mathfrak{P}$ = phenomena, the totality of experiences/feelings
   - $\mathcal{E}$ = structure on P, described using category theory
   - Objects in E = parts of phenomena (feelings, experiences)
   - Morphisms in E = 联想 (associations) — also phenomena, also feelings
   
   Key insight: morphisms (associations) are *themselves* objects (experiences). This makes E a "tower structure" (塔式结构) where there's no fundamental distinction between things and relations.

3. **形而上 as universal property:**
   "一个形而上 m 是 E 中的联想，且 m 在 E 的某个子范畴中是范性质。"
   
   A *metaphysical concept* is an association that is a universal property in some subcategory. Example: "笔" (pen) is the terminal object in the subcategory containing pencils, crayons, chalk, etc. — it's what you arrive at from any of these via association.

4. **Ship of Theseus analysis:**
   The "essence" of the ship is the experience/feeling you get when you encounter any part of the ship. It's the universal property of the subcategory of ship-parts. Crucially: if we choose the wrong $\mathfrak{P}$ (physical world instead of phenomena), we get paradoxes. The ship's essence doesn't exist in physics; it exists in our phenomenal structure.

5. **The meta-order problem:**
   E is *descriptive*, not *constructive*. We cannot say whether "pen" is more basic than "pencil" or vice versa — it depends on how we arrived at each concept. The dragon-blood example (龙血): for John the alchemist, "dragon blood" and "human blood" are at the same meta-order (both derived from blood + creature). For Luke who's never seen a dragon bleed, "dragon blood" is higher-order (derived from "human blood" + analogy to dragons).

6. **Metaphysics as construction:**
   "一个 M 上的形而上学（metaphysics），或者说，一个'第三类（种）形而上'，是一个 M 上的构造。"
   
   A *metaphysics* is a choice of construction — a way of assigning meta-orders to objects. Top-down: start from 道 (the Way) and generate everything. Bottom-up: start from phenomena and abstract upward to 道.

**Key terms:**
- 境 / $\mathcal{E}$ (E) — the structured field of experience
- 联想 — association (the morphisms of E)
- 塔式结构 — tower structure (where morphisms are also objects)
- 范性质 / 泛性质 — universal property
- 元阶 — meta-order
- 构造 — construction

**Critical insight for translation:**
The author is using mathematical category theory as a *language* for describing philosophical structure. The key translation challenge: preserving the technical precision while making clear that this is metaphor/model, not claim that the mind literally implements category theory.

**Connection to previous essays:**
- Essay 4's 第一/第二实在 maps to $\mathfrak{P}$ and $\mathcal{E}$
- Essay 5's 梦境 is formally defined as $\mathcal{E}$ — structure on phenomena
- The 形而上 levels from Essay 4 get formalized as meta-orders

**Translation concerns:**
- "境" — now has a technical definition as a category structure. "Field" or "realm" might work, but the Chinese 境 has resonances (境界, 意境, 梦境) that no single English word captures.
- "联想" — "association" is accurate but bland. The term carries connotations of spontaneous mental linking.
- "塔式结构" — "tower structure" is literal; "meta-categorical structure" might be more descriptive.
- Mathematical notation: should be preserved, but the English prose needs to make the intuitions accessible.

## 7. 范畴论与境：K1策略

**Core project:** Using functors and natural transformations to model the dynamics of cognition, understanding, and meaning. This is the most technically ambitious essay — an attempt to give formal conditions for "understanding."

**Philosophy of language observations:**

1. **Evolution and transformation functors:**
   - $T_t: \mathbb{E}_t \to \mathbb{E}_{t+1}$ — the evolution of the experiential field over time
   - $(F_{E,L})_t: (\mathcal{E}_L)_t \to \mathbb{E}_t$ — embedding language structure into experience
   - $(F_{L \to K})_t: (\mathcal{E}_L)_t \to (\mathcal{E}_K)_t$ — mapping language to knowledge structures
   
   The formal apparatus captures how language, knowledge, and experience interrelate.

2. **Stable structures ($S_E$):**
   The hypothesis that evolution preserves certain structures. If $\mathbb{E}_{t_c}$ is the minimal field (perhaps at birth), then $S_{E_c}$ might constitute "innate cognitive structure" — not a metaphysical claim but a structural one: whatever is preserved across all evolution from that point.

3. **Understanding as natural transformation:**
   This is the key philosophical claim. Consider two paths from mathematical structure to experience:
   - Path 1: Embed math in experience at $t$, then evolve experience
   - Path 2: Evolve math structure, then embed in experience at $t+1$
   
   When these paths "agree" (up to natural transformation), we have *understanding*. The component $\eta_a$ is the feeling of "confirmation" — comparing your mental derivation with the answer.
   
   "当 $\eta_a$ 是单位元时，意味着我们对 '1+1' 的思考结果所带来的感受，与我们直接看到 '1+1=2' 时的感受完全一致" — when η is identity, you've *mastered* a concept.

4. **The naturality condition on understanding:**
   For a proof step $f: a \to a'$:
   $(F_{E,M})_{t+1}(T_M(f)) \circ \eta_a = \eta_{a'} \circ T((F_{E,M})_t(f))$
   
   Translation: If you master $a'$ and can stably reproduce the derivation $f$ in your mind, then mastering $a$ requires being able to go $a \to a' \to a$. You can't just accidentally get from an incomprehensible premise to a simple conclusion — you need to be able to reverse the path.

5. **"I understand" as alignment experience:**
   "一句话能够被理解，他必须能够在心理过程的演化和结构的演化中达成如上所述的这种一致性感受η" — a sentence is understood when the structure's evolution and the mind's evolution align.
   
   The "cat jumping on table" example: as you read word by word, your mental simulation tracks the sentence's structure. When they align, you feel you understand. When they don't (as with absurd memes), you don't understand *linguistically* — but you might understand *culturally* if the meme's cultural embedding aligns with your experience.

6. **Structure vs. meaning:**
   "对于语言来说，是结构先于意义，还是意义先于结构？"
   
   Answer: neither is prior. They relate via natural transformation. Meaning is not an entity but an alignment-experience between structure-evolution and experience-evolution.

7. **Philosophical experiment methodology:**
   The essay proposes that if we can design experiences that reliably evoke specific structural positions, we can verify philosophical claims empirically. We don't need to prove people have the "same" qualia — only that their experiences occupy the same structural positions.

**Key terms:**
- 函子 (functor)
- 自然变换 (natural transformation)
- 稳定结构 ($S_E$) — stable structure
- η — the alignment/confirmation experience
- 掌握 — mastery (when η is identity)

**Critical assessment from philosophy of language:**
This is an ambitious attempt to formalize what Wittgenstein gestured at with "meaning is use." The natural transformation formalism captures the idea that understanding is not a mental state but a dynamic alignment between structure and experience. The approach is constructive where Wittgenstein was therapeutic — but it's working in the same territory.

The risk: the formalism might be doing less work than it appears. Are we learning something new from category theory, or just dressing up intuitions in mathematical clothing? The author is aware of this: "范畴论仅仅是工具的一种" — category theory is just one tool.

**Translation concerns:**
- Mathematical notation: must be preserved, with careful glossing
- "掌握" — "mastery" captures the idea (when η = identity)
- "确认感" — "confirmation feeling" is awkward; perhaps "alignment experience"
- The philosophical terminology (稳定结构, 演化, 兼容) needs consistent treatment

## Second Reading: Critical Notes

### Tension 1: Realism vs. Constructivism
Essay 1 uses realist-sounding language ("emergent patterns are objective like mathematics"). But Essays 4-7 are constructivist — all concepts are built on phenomena. Is the "objective like mathematics" claim compatible with the later framework? Possible resolution: mathematical objectivity is itself structural, not metaphysical.

### Tension 2: Normativity Gap
Essay 3 valorizes internal meaning-generation over external meaning-seeking. The cat example is presented as more authentic than the alienated worker. But the framework (Essays 4-7) is explicitly descriptive. What grounds the implicit normative claim that internal meaning is better?

The author acknowledges this: "是否应当追求他，在此我们并未得出结论." But the earlier essays seem to make normative claims the framework can't support.

### Tension 3: Introspection Reliability
The K1 strategy relies on introspection (自省) to verify:
- The existence of functors between categories
- The η alignment experience
- The structural positions of experiences

But introspection is philosophically contentious. The framework assumes we have privileged access to our cognitive structures. This is a significant vulnerability.

### Tension 4: Circularity in Tool Choice
The author says: "我们又不得不借助一些框架来描述现象，因而即便我极力尝试还原其作为现象的本来面貌，但是其仍旧是失准的" (Essay 4, fn. 3).

This is honest but raises a question: if any description requires frameworks, and frameworks are 形而上 constructions, how can we describe phenomena "as they really are"? The answer seems to be: we can't, and that's okay — but then what grounds the privileging of phenomena as "第一实在"?

### New Appreciation: Explicit Wittgensteinian Connection
The K1 strategy explicitly connects to Wittgenstein: "我们就可以通过语言游戏研究语言演化中的稳定结构 S_L" — language games reveal stable linguistic structures that map (via functors) to cognitive structures. This is a formal elaboration of Wittgenstein's method.

### New Appreciation: The 非理性 Acknowledgment
The claim that metaphysical pursuit is non-rational (非理性) but must be acknowledged is structurally similar to Wittgenstein's "hinge propositions" — things we don't question because they're the frame within which questioning happens.

## 8. 关于诗意和境的一些零散想法 (Appendix)

**Nature:** Scattered reflections expanding on the main essays. Less systematic but often more accessible.

**Philosophy of language observations:**

1. **The human condition as enabling, not limiting:**
   "谁会因为小说只能用语言而悲叹呢？" — who laments that novels can only use language? The "limitation" of being confined to phenomena is not tragedy but the condition of creativity. Imprecise perception enables three-color displays; imprecise pitch perception enables equal temperament. The frame is what makes meaning possible.

2. **Coin-flip as 诗意:**
   The coin-flip method for decision-making only works if you *really* believe you'll follow the result. "你必须真的相信这个硬币的结果是你要去执行的，你才能够知道你更想要哪一个." This is 诗意: creating a 境 (frame) that reveals something. Lucid engagement with a constructed frame.

3. **Category theory as one tool among many:**
   "我在这里使用范畴论仅仅是我出于个人直觉和兴趣的一个工具性的选择" — category theory is just one tool. Others include: logical propositions, poetic imagery, scientific theory, artistic aesthetics. All of these are ways of "mapping phenomena" and thereby gaining descriptive and constructive power.

4. **Two questions the framework addresses:**
   - **哲学如何可能？** (How is philosophy possible?) — Does philosophy need to relate to human practice? How can it return to practice?
   - **意义如何可能？** (How is meaning possible?) — How does meaning enter our field of view or arise within it?
   
   The second is framed as a Kantian question: the answer to "what does X mean?" might be a kind of knowledge (synthetic a priori?), produced through subjective synthesis of phenomena.

5. **List of problems claimed to be addressed:**
   The essay lists numerous philosophical problems allegedly dissolved or resolved by this framework:
   - Definition of collective interest
   - Definition of knowledge
   - Absurdism
   - Kantian questions
   - Existentialism
   - Ship of Theseus
   - Objectification and alienation
   - Meaning vs. structure priority in language
   - What is understanding
   - Meno's paradox
   - Intersubjectivity
   
   Bold claims. Whether they're vindicated is another matter — but the ambition is clear.

6. **The Mencius quote:** "非独贤者有是心也，人皆有之" — "Not only the worthy have this heart; all people have it." Paired with Socrates on "wisdom attainable by man." The framework claims to describe what all humans already do — construct 境, generate meaning, evolve understanding.

**Translation concerns:**
- The appendix is informal and can be translated more loosely
- Memes are referenced but not translated — they're visual
- The "two questions" section is philosophically dense and needs careful rendering
