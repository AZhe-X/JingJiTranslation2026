# Report Reading Memo — Wittgenstein Advisor

## Overview

Read all 8 advisor reports. Notes below organized by relevance to philosophy of language questions.

## Buddhism Report

**Key insight for my domain**: The apoha convergence I identified is confirmed and deepened. Buddhism notes that Dignāga/Dharmakīrti's apoha (meaning through exclusion) shares the author's structural approach to concepts — both reject mental particulars as ground of general terms. But Buddhism is right that apoha is a *positive semantic theory* while later Wittgenstein is *deflationary*. The author's framework may split this difference: positive structure (category theory) serving therapeutic ends.

**η and arthakriyā**: Buddhism identifies η with Dharmakīrti's *arthakriyāsāmarthya* (capacity for effective action). This is significant — it grounds understanding in practical success, not correspondence. Parallels meaning-as-use.

**Tension to probe**: Buddhism asks whether 诗意 is liberation or "sophisticated samsaric engagement." From my perspective: is the poetic stance a genuine dissolution of philosophical confusion, or a way of living with confusion? Wittgenstein would say the former — but the distinction matters.

**Translation point**: Buddhism's suggestion to retain 境 untranslated aligns with my recommendation. No English term captures the resonances.

## Epistemology Report

**Direct relevance to η question**: Epistemology identifies η as a "structural account of understanding that avoids both truth-tracking views and mere coherentism." This is exactly right. η is structural alignment, not grasping truth. But Epistemology raises my concern: does this provide a *criterion* for correct understanding, or just *redescribe* what we already do?

**The digestion problem**: Epistemology emphasizes the "digestion" move — phenomena must be converted to beliefs before serving as justification. This echoes Sellars on the Myth of the Given. Important for rule-following: the application of a rule is not given by phenomena directly but requires "digestion" into the practice.

**Introspection reliability**: Epistemology notes the author's modest claim — introspection verifies that structures *exist*, not their external accuracy. This shifts the burden from content (unreliable) to structural position (more defensible). Relevant for the "philosophical experiment" methodology.

**Essays as experiments**: Epistemology identifies the specific experimental structure of the essays (Three Bobs, Sisyphus→cat graduation). This confirms the essays are performative, not merely descriptive. Translation must preserve experiential sequence.

## Phenomenology Report

**η as Erfüllung**: Phenomenology identifies η with Husserl's fulfillment (Erfüllung) of intention by intuition. This is a productive connection — but does structural alignment exhaust phenomenological evidence? Phenomenology leaves this open.

**Intersubjectivity gap**: Phenomenology notes the framework is "largely first-personal" — how do different people's 境 relate? This connects to my beetle-in-the-box question. The author's η-mechanism claims to address this through shared structural alignment with external constraints, but Phenomenology finds this underdeveloped.

**Discrete vs. continuous time**: Phenomenology raises a technical concern — the K1 framework uses discrete t, t+1, but lived time has retention-protention structure. This matters for language acquisition and understanding development.

**Body-subject absence**: Merleau-Ponty's motor intentionality is implicit (cat example) but not thematized. Relevant for embodied meaning — language use is bodily practice.

---

## Kantian Report

**Necessity vs. stability**: This is the core methodological divergence. Kant asks "What *must* be the case?" (necessity); the author asks "What *persists*?" (stability). Kantian notes the author is "open to transcendental grounding but hasn't (yet) provided it." This connects to my question about whether relocating normativity to practice *satisfies* or *evades* the demand for justification.

**η as schematism**: Kantian identifies η as playing the role of Kant's schematism — bridging formal structure and concrete experience. This is significant for philosophy of language: how do abstract rules get applied to particular cases?

**Intersubjectivity solution**: Kantian credits the η-mechanism for converting Kant's metaphysical postulate (shared categories) into an "empirically investigable structural claim." This directly addresses my beetle-in-the-box question. Two people understand the same thing not through identical qualia but through structurally aligned η.

**"Another Kantian question"**: The author explicitly positions "How is meaning possible?" as "another kind of Kantian question." This framing deserves emphasis in translation.

## Metaphysics Report

**Formalism question directly addressed**: Metaphysics asks whether category theory "tracks real structures" or just provides vocabulary. The author is careful to call it a "tool" — but the framework's coherence depends on it. Metaphysics notes a tension between methodological pragmatism and implicit realism about stable structures.

**η-mechanism for intersubjectivity**: Metaphysics provides the clearest articulation: "Two people 'understand the same thing' when their respective η has the same *form*." This sidesteps the inverted spectrum problem (structural position matters, not phenomenal content) and "formally recovers Wittgenstein's private language argument (η as public criterion)."

This is the key claim I need to examine. Does η actually provide a *public criterion* in Wittgenstein's sense? Or does the "felt structural alignment" itself face the private language worry?

**Essays as philosophical experiments**: Metaphysics confirms the performative function of the essays — they aim to restructure the reader's 境. "If translation fails to reproduce the experiential effect, philosophical content is lost because the content IS the restructuring."

## Philosophy of Mind Report

**Beetle-in-the-box connection developed**: Phil-Mind explicitly connects η to the private language argument: "Intersubjectivity requires structural alignment, not shared qualia." This is exactly the claim I need to examine. Phil-Mind's assessment: this "sidesteps" the private language argument rather than facing it directly.

**Understanding is phenomenal**: Phil-Mind emphasizes that understanding is felt, not computed. "The 'I get it' experience isn't a byproduct of understanding — it constitutes understanding." This aligns with my view that meaning is use, not mental representation. But the move from "felt" to "structural" needs scrutiny.

**Arrows-only metacategory**: Phil-Mind notes the author's comment that objects ARE identity morphisms. "The feeling of 'pencil' is not ontologically different from the feeling of 'pencil-reminds-me-of-pen.'" This resonates with James's radical empiricism and dissolves the concept/percept divide. Relevant for family resemblance.

**Structural functionalism applied to phenomenology**: Phil-Mind identifies the framework as a novel hybrid — "standard functionalism defines mental states by causal roles in behavior; this defines experiential states by structural roles in the experiential category." The roles are roles in a category of experiences, not causal chains.

## Chinese Philosophy Report

**恒常 vs. 無常**: Chinese Philosophy clarifies that the author's 恒常 is epistemological/pragmatic ("what we seek to act meaningfully"), not ontological like Buddhist 無常. The pursuit of constancy is non-rational but must be acknowledged. This connects to my rule-following point — Wittgenstein relocates normativity to shared practice, which requires some constancy.

**The 道德仁義禮 inversion**: Chinese Philosophy notes this may be right about *epistemology* (how we learn concepts) while missing *ontology* (what's really prior). A Confucian might say: yes, we derive the *concept* from observation, but the *reality* of 仁 is prior. This parallels debates about rule-following — does the rule exist prior to its applications, or only in them?

**Essays as experiments precedent**: Chinese Philosophy identifies precedent in Mencius's 孺子入井 — not argument but experiment. The reader is invited to notice their spontaneous response. This confirms the performative methodology has Chinese philosophical roots.

**Neo-Confucian lacuna**: No engagement with 良知 (Wang Yangming's innate knowing that cuts through mediation). This would challenge the author's constructivism from a different angle than Western intuitionism.

## Existentialism Report

**Democratized authenticity**: Existentialism notes that 诗意 makes everyone a poet — "我们正是这样的创造者，是自己生命和感受的诗人." This democratizes what existentialism often reserves for exceptional figures. Relevant for my concern: if meaning-as-use is public and shared, understanding shouldn't require heroic individual achievement.

**Death bracketed**: The author argues against Heidegger's being-toward-death: "自己的死亡对于自己是超越性的。因此不可能向死而生." The death one is "toward" is always one's *conception* of death. This argument has force — but does the same apply to all concepts? Is meaning always mediated by our conception of meaning?

**η solves intersubjectivity**: Existentialism credits η for providing "structural commensurability without requiring shared qualia." Two people understand the same thing not through identical inner experience but through structurally aligned experiential evolution. This "sidesteps the qualia problem entirely."

**Lightness**: Existentialism notes the absence of classical existentialist pathos (anxiety, nausea, uncanniness). The author treats groundlessness with equanimity. From my perspective: Wittgenstein also treats philosophical problems with a kind of therapeutic calm once they're dissolved. The question is whether the dissolution is genuine.

## Summary: Key Points for Discussion

### Topic 2 (η as criterion or redescription)
- Epistemology: provides structural account avoiding truth-tracking and mere coherentism
- Kantian: functions like schematism bridging formal structure and experience
- All advisors agree η is felt alignment, not propositional grasp
- **My question remains**: Does this provide a *criterion* or just redescribe?

### Topic 4 (Intersubjectivity via η)
- Metaphysics: "formally recovers Wittgenstein's private language argument (η as public criterion)"
- Phil-Mind: "sidesteps" the private language argument rather than facing it
- Existentialism: "sidesteps the qualia problem entirely"
- **My question**: Does the "felt structural alignment" itself face the private language worry?

### Topic 1 (Category theory essential or dispensable)
- Metaphysics: tension between methodological pragmatism and implicit realism
- All advisors note author's caveat that it's "one tool among many"
- **Key insight**: The formalism may do work precisely by NOT being the only tool — it's one language game among many for describing the same structures

### Topic 19 (Apoha and family resemblance)
- Buddhism: convergence confirmed — both reject mental particulars
- Buddhism: apoha is positive theory, Wittgenstein is deflationary
- **Question for Buddhism discussion**: Does the 境集 framework offer a synthesis?
