## Overall Assessment

**Rating: Good**

The Translator's Note is appropriate and minimal. The decision to preserve the author's original English verbatim is correct — this essay needs no translation, only contextual framing.

## Philosophy of Language Observations

### The TN

The existing TN correctly:
1. Notes the essay was composed in English
2. Links "phenomena" to the Chinese 现象 and the collection's technical vocabulary
3. Signals this essay's relationship to the later framework

This is sufficient apparatus. The TN does exactly what it should: orient readers without over-explaining.

### Key Philosophical Content (For Future Reference)

The essay introduces two moves that become central to the framework:

1. **The "digestion" problem** (paragraph beginning "These examples show..."): Phenomena must be *converted* to belief before serving as justification. This echoes Sellars on the Myth of the Given — the given cannot justify without conceptualization. In the later K1策略, this becomes the mechanism of η: the alignment experience is how phenomena get "digested" into understanding.

2. **The access constraint** ("Things that are not accessible cannot be used as a starting point"): This methodological principle runs through the entire collection. It's Wittgensteinian in spirit — what we cannot use in practice drops out of the analysis. Truth becomes "methodologically impossible" not because it doesn't exist but because we can't access it.

3. **Knowledge collapses to belief**: The conclusion that "knowledge is just... belief?" resonates with *On Certainty* — but goes further. Wittgenstein preserves the grammar of "knowing"; the author deflates it entirely at the practical level.

### No Changes Needed

The minimal apparatus approach is correct. This is the author's English; adding more TNs would be intrusive. The single TN provides the necessary bridge to the collection's vocabulary.

## Recommendation

**Approve as-is.** No changes from my domain.
