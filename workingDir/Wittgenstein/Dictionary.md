# Dictionary

**Compiled by**: Wittgenstein / Philosophy of Language Specialist
**Date**: February 2026
**Purpose**: Translation recommendations for key terms in the 境集 essays, with attention to resonance and divergence with Wittgensteinian vocabulary and the broader philosophy of language tradition.

---

## 语言游戏
- **Main translation**: language game(s)
- **Alternatives**: language-game(s) (hyphenated, following some Wittgenstein translators); linguistic game(s) (avoid --- this is non-standard)
- **Note**: This is the standard translation of Wittgenstein's *Sprachspiel(e)* (PI section 7 ff.). The author uses this term explicitly in K1策略, but with a crucial difference: for Wittgenstein, language games are the irreducible unit of meaning --- the bedrock. For the author, language games are a *method* for discovering stable structures ($S_L$) that can be mapped onto experiential structures ($S_E$). The translator should preserve "language games" as the translation (since the author is deliberately invoking the Wittgensteinian concept) but should add a translator's note on first occurrence explaining the methodological reorientation. The hyphenated form "language-game" is used by Anscombe and Hacker and may signal closer fidelity to the Wittgensteinian original.

## 哲学治疗
- **Main translation**: philosophical therapy
- **Alternatives**: philosophical therapeutics; philosophische Therapie (if retaining the German is desired in a scholarly context)
- **Note**: Standard rendering of the late Wittgenstein's conception of philosophy as therapy (PI section 133, section 255). The author uses this term in K1策略 to describe a process whose effectiveness the framework aims to *explain* structurally (through the resolution of categorical tension / 张力). For Wittgenstein, philosophical therapy does not *have* an explanation --- it simply works when one achieves the "perspicuous presentation" (*ubersichtliche Darstellung*). The translator should use "philosophical therapy" without qualification, as the departure from Wittgenstein is explained in context.

## 境
- **Main translation**: *jing* (transliterated, with extensive initial gloss)
- **Alternatives**: experiential realm; structured experiential field; experiential domain; *Erfahrungsfeld* (German coinage, if targeting a continental audience)
- **Note**: This is the most challenging term in the collection. 境 carries resonances with multiple philosophical traditions: (1) In Buddhist philosophy, 境 (*visaya*) refers to the objects or domains of sensory experience. (2) In Chinese aesthetics, 境界 refers to a cultivated state of awareness or an artistic atmosphere. (3) In Wittgenstein, the closest concept is "form of life" (*Lebensform*), but 境 is more individualistic and more formalized. (4) In phenomenology, *Lebenswelt* (lifeworld) is proximate but more communal. The author defines 境 technically as a categorical structure $\mathbb{E}$ on phenomena $\mathfrak{P}$ --- experiences as objects, associations as morphisms, forming a tower structure. No single English word captures this. I recommend **transliterating as *jing*** on first use, with a gloss: "*jing* (境, structured experiential realm --- a categorical structure imposed on the field of phenomena, in which experiences serve as objects and associations as morphisms)." After the initial gloss, use *jing* throughout. This preserves the term's conceptual distinctiveness and avoids false equivalences with existing philosophical vocabulary. If transliteration is unacceptable, "experiential realm" is the best compromise, but it loses the aesthetic and Buddhist resonances.

## 梦境
- **Main translation**: dreamscape
- **Alternatives**: dream-realm; oneiric field; *mengjing* (transliteration)
- **Note**: The author introduces 梦境 in 形而上学后的目的：诗意 as a poetic term for the "environment" in which meaning becomes possible. He explicitly notes it does not refer only to sleeping dreams but to any structured context that enables experience and purpose. "Dreamscape" captures both the oneiric quality and the spatial/structural metaphor. The distinction between 沉醉的梦境 (immersed dreamscape) and 清醒的梦境 (lucid dreamscape) is critical. In Wittgensteinian terms, 梦境 has no direct counterpart, but the immersed/lucid distinction resonates with the difference between being *within* a language game (as participants normally are) and being *aware* of the language game as a language game (as the philosopher sometimes becomes). However, the author's concept is richer than this --- lucidity in a dreamscape does not diminish engagement, whereas Wittgensteinian "awareness" of language games is typically philosophical detachment.

## 意义
- **Main translation**: meaning
- **Alternatives**: significance; sense
- **Note**: Standard philosophical term. In the author's framework, meaning is experiential --- it is the felt sense ($\eta$) of alignment between structural evolution and experiential evolution. This is closer to Wittgenstein's meaning-as-use than to Frege's *Sinn* (sense) or *Bedeutung* (reference), and far from truth-conditional accounts. "Meaning" is adequate, but the translator should avoid contexts where "meaning" might be read as "reference" or "denotation." In passages where the author discusses meaning as inseparable from feeling (意义和感受即是两面一体), "significance" may be more apt, as it preserves the felt/lived quality. Note also that in some contexts (especially 后形而上学), 意义 operates more as "purpose" or "significance-for-a-life" rather than linguistic meaning; context should guide the choice.

## 结构
- **Main translation**: structure
- **Alternatives**: none needed for the term itself; but in category-theoretic contexts, specify "categorical structure"
- **Note**: "Structure" is standard and unproblematic as a translation. However, the translator should note that the author's use of "structure" is technical: it refers to the categorical structure (objects + morphisms + composition) that $\mathbb{E}$ embodies. This is not "structure" in the structuralist linguistic sense (Saussure, Chomsky) nor in the Wittgensteinian sense of "logical form" (Tractatus). The author's structures are *experiential* --- they describe how feelings, associations, and concepts are organized. In contexts where the formal sense is paramount, "categorical structure" is clearer.

## 理解
- **Main translation**: understanding
- **Alternatives**: comprehension; grasping
- **Note**: The standard translation of Wittgenstein's *Verstehen*. In the author's framework, understanding is characterized by the existence of a natural transformation $\eta$ between structural evolution and experiential evolution. When $\eta$ exists, "I understand" (我懂了); when it does not, I do not. Wittgenstein famously asks: "But how does the understanding manifest itself?" and answers in terms of ability --- understanding is the ability to go on (PI section 154). The author's $\eta$ can be read as a formalization of this ability: the capacity to track structural evolution with experiential evolution. "Understanding" is the right translation; "comprehension" is too cognitive, and "grasping" (Erfassen) has its own Fregean baggage.

## 掌握
- **Main translation**: mastery; direct grasp
- **Alternatives**: command; complete understanding
- **Note**: The author defines 掌握 as a special case of understanding where $\eta_a$ is the identity morphism --- a direct, unmediated confirmation-sense. This is a stronger concept than 理解 (understanding). The distinction is philosophically important: one can understand a mathematical theorem (have a non-trivial $\eta_a$) without having mastered it (without $\eta_a$ being the identity). "Mastery" captures this well. "Direct grasp" is more phenomenologically precise. Wittgenstein's "knowing how to go on" (PI section 151) is closer to 理解 than to 掌握; the latter's directness and immediacy has more affinity with the phenomenological notion of *Evidenz* (Husserl) --- a self-giving presence of the object of understanding. I recommend "mastery" for general use, with "direct grasp" available for more philosophically precise contexts.

## 规则
- **Main translation**: rule(s)
- **Alternatives**: norm(s); regularity/regularities
- **Note**: Standard translation. However, the author's "rules" are stable structures ($S_E$, $S_L$) preserved under functorial evolution --- they are structural invariants, closer to mathematical symmetries than to Wittgensteinian rules-as-practices. Wittgenstein argues that rules do not determine their own application (PI sections 185--202); the author's rules, as functorial invariants, are in a sense self-determining (they are what the functor preserves). In contexts where the author's structural sense is dominant, "invariant" or "stable structure" may be more accurate than "rule." But when the author is discussing linguistic or epistemic rules (语法规则 etc.), "rule" is standard and correct.

## 恒常
- **Main translation**: constancy
- **Alternatives**: invariance; permanence; persistence
- **Note**: The author defines 恒常 as the core of metaphysical thinking --- the drive to find what persists through change. "Constancy" is the best rendering because it preserves the phenomenological register (what *seems* to stay the same) without importing the full mathematical sense of "invariance." However, in technical passages where the author connects 恒常 to functorial preservation of structure, "invariance" is more precise. "Permanence" risks suggesting temporal permanence specifically; the author's concept is broader (including structural, not just temporal, constancy). From a Wittgensteinian perspective, 恒常 is related to the "hardness" of certain propositions in *On Certainty* --- propositions that function as the stable framework within which other propositions can be doubted (OC section 96).

## 感受
- **Main translation**: experience (when general); feeling (when specific)
- **Alternatives**: sensation; affect; lived experience (*Erlebnis*)
- **Note**: The author uses 感受 in a technically broad sense: any element of $\mathfrak{P}$ (the totality of phenomena). This includes sensory input (感觉/刺激, the first sense identified in the footnote to 形而上学后的目的：诗意) and the "crystallizations" and "surges" of these inputs (the second sense). "Experience" captures the breadth; "feeling" captures the experiential quality. In passages about $\mathfrak{P}$ and its elements, "experience" is preferable; in passages about emotional or aesthetic responses, "feeling" is more natural. Avoid "sensation" (too narrow, too empiricist) and "qualia" (too loaded with philosophy-of-mind debates the author explicitly sidesteps).

## 联想
- **Main translation**: association
- **Alternatives**: associative link; connection
- **Note**: The author uses 联想 to designate the morphisms in $\mathcal{E}$ --- the links between experiential objects. "Association" is the natural English term and has a long history in empiricist philosophy (Hume, Mill). In the author's framework, associations are both morphisms (structural links) and objects (they are themselves experiences, hence the tower structure). There is no Wittgensteinian parallel to this specific usage, but the idea that the link *between* experiences is itself an experience has affinities with William James's "stream of consciousness" and with Husserl's theory of internal time-consciousness.

## 现象
- **Main translation**: phenomenon/phenomena
- **Alternatives**: appearance(s); what appears; the manifest
- **Note**: The author uses 现象 in a specific sense: the totality of what is directly experienced, the "first reality" (第一实在). This is closer to Husserl's *Phanomen* (what appears to consciousness) than to Kant's *Erscheinung* (appearance as opposed to thing-in-itself). For Wittgenstein, "phenomena" does not play a central systematic role, though he discusses the "phenomenological" language in the *Remarks on Colour* and *Philosophical Remarks*. "Phenomenon/phenomena" is standard and adequate.

## 形而上
- **Main translation**: the metaphysical (as adjective/noun); metaphysical construct (when referring to a specific 形而上)
- **Alternatives**: meta-physical (hyphenated, to emphasize the "beyond the physical" etymology)
- **Note**: The author draws a careful distinction between 形而上 (a metaphysical concept/construct --- a product of abstraction from phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics as a discipline). This distinction is lost in English where "metaphysics" and "the metaphysical" are related but not as precisely differentiated. I recommend preserving the distinction by using "a metaphysical (construct)" for 形而上 and "metaphysics" for 形而上学. The author's layered typology (Types 0-3) further specifies: Type 0 = empirical generalization; Type 1 = empirical prediction; Type 2 = abstract concept; Type 3 = framework/value system. These should be rendered as "metaphysical construct of the zeroth/first/second/third kind."

## 非理性
- **Main translation**: the non-rational; non-rationality
- **Alternatives**: the irrational; irrationality
- **Note**: Crucial distinction: the author does not use 非理性 pejoratively. It refers to that which lies outside the scope of reason --- motivation, purpose, the drive for constancy, the impulse toward self-realization. "The non-rational" preserves the author's neutral tone; "the irrational" carries connotations of unreason or madness that are inappropriate here. In Wittgensteinian terms, the non-rational corresponds to what cannot be *said* (expressed in propositions) but only *shown* (manifested in practice) --- cf. Tractatus 4.1212, 6.522. The later Wittgenstein's insistence that reasons come to an end (PI section 211, section 217: "This is simply what I do") is also relevant: at some point, justification bottoms out in action, which is itself non-rational.

## 诗意
- **Main translation**: the poetic; poetic engagement
- **Alternatives**: poeticity; poetic dwelling
- **Note**: The author uses 诗意 as a technical term for the lucid dreamscape --- the mode of engaging with a meaning-structure while being aware of its constructed nature. "The poetic" captures this if understood in the full Heideggerian sense of *Dichtung* (poetic thinking that opens a world). "Poetic engagement" is more accessible. There is no Wittgensteinian equivalent, but the concept resonates with the later Wittgenstein's own style --- the way the *Investigations* proceeds through examples, metaphors, and invitations to *look* rather than through formal arguments. The poetic, in the author's sense, is itself a philosophical method.

## 清醒
- **Main translation**: lucid; lucidity
- **Alternatives**: awake; aware; clear-sighted
- **Note**: Used in contrast to 沉醉 (immersed/intoxicated). Refers to the state of engaging with a dreamscape (meaning-structure) while being aware that it is constructed. "Lucid" is the best translation, evoking "lucid dreaming" --- the parallel is exact. In Wittgensteinian terms, this corresponds to the philosophical moment of recognizing a language game *as* a language game, but without the Wittgensteinian consequence of therapeutic dissolution. The author insists that lucidity does not diminish engagement.

## 沉醉
- **Main translation**: immersion; immersed
- **Alternatives**: intoxication; engrossment; absorption
- **Note**: Used in contrast to 清醒 (lucid). Refers to the state of engaging with a dreamscape without awareness of its constructed nature --- taking the meaning-structure as given, as ultimate reality. The author identifies this with 信念 (belief/faith) and 信仰 (religious faith). "Immersion" is adequate but lacks the connotation of intoxication present in 醉. "Intoxication" captures this but sounds negative; the author's usage is more descriptive than pejorative. Context should guide: "immersion" for neutral contexts, "intoxication" where the element of unknowing is emphasized.

## 虚无
- **Main translation**: nothingness; the void
- **Alternatives**: nihility; vacuity (虚) + delusion (妄) when 虚无 appears as 虚妄
- **Note**: The author distinguishes between 虚无主义 (nihilism --- the historical phenomenon of the collapse of "highest values") and 虚无 as a philosophical concept. 虚无主义 should be "nihilism." In the footnote where the author defines 虚妄 (from their personal usage since middle school), 虚 = "without substance" and 妄 = "arrogant, self-deceived." This specific compound is best translated as "vain delusion" or "empty presumption." Wittgenstein does not use the concept of nothingness systematically, but his therapeutic aim of dissolving pseudo-problems can be compared to the author's post-nihilistic project of constructing meaning *after* the recognition of 虚无.

## 知识
- **Main translation**: knowledge
- **Alternatives**: knowing; epistemic state
- **Note**: Standard translation. The author's Knowledge essay argues that knowledge, in practice, reduces to belief. This aligns with certain readings of *On Certainty* (Moyal-Sharrock's "animal certainty") but goes further than Wittgenstein, who preserves the grammar of "knowing" even while transforming its philosophical significance. Use "knowledge" throughout, noting that the author's thesis is deflationary.

## 信念
- **Main translation**: belief
- **Alternatives**: conviction; commitment
- **Note**: Standard translation. In the Knowledge essay, belief is defined as "a thought of taking something as true" --- this is subjective and independent of objective truth. In 形而上学后的目的：诗意, 信念 is connected to 沉醉 (immersed dreamscape). Wittgenstein's treatment of belief in *On Certainty* distinguishes between beliefs (which can be doubted) and hinge propositions (which cannot be meaningfully doubted). The author's usage is closer to the ordinary sense.

## 我
- **Main translation**: the self; I
- **Alternatives**: the subject; ego (avoid --- too Freudian)
- **Note**: The author defines "我" structurally: "我" is the feeling that arises when anything related to me is mentioned --- the universal property of a sub-category containing all my attributes and experiences. This is a fascinating structural account of selfhood. Wittgenstein discusses the self in the Tractatus (5.631--5.641: "The subject does not belong to the world: rather, it is a limit of the world") and in the *Investigations* (where the "I" is not a referring expression picking out an inner entity). The author's structural definition is compatible with Wittgenstein's anti-Cartesianism: "I" is not a substance but a structural position. Translate as "the self" in philosophical contexts, "I" in first-person contexts.

## 自然变换
- **Main translation**: natural transformation
- **Alternatives**: none (this is the standard mathematical term)
- **Note**: Category-theoretic term. In the author's framework, natural transformations capture the alignment between structural evolution (in a formal system like language or mathematics) and experiential evolution. The key philosophical innovation is interpreting the component $\eta_a$ as an *experience* --- the felt sense of confirmation or understanding. This bridges the gap between formal category theory and phenomenology. Always translate as "natural transformation" and preserve the mathematical notation.

## 函子
- **Main translation**: functor
- **Alternatives**: none (standard mathematical term)
- **Note**: Category-theoretic term. The author uses several types of functors: evolution functors ($T_t$), embedding functors ($(F_{E,L})_t$), and cross-domain functors ($(F_{L \to M})_t$). Each has a specific philosophical interpretation (temporal evolution, embedding of a sub-domain into total experience, translation between experiential domains). Always translate as "functor."

## 泛性质
- **Main translation**: universal property
- **Alternatives**: universal (informal); universality
- **Note**: Category-theoretic term. In A1策略, the author identifies metaphysical concepts (形而上) with universal properties of sub-categories. For example, "笔" (pen) is the terminal object of a sub-category containing all specific pen-experiences. This is the author's most distinctive philosophical-mathematical innovation: metaphysical "essences" are not Platonic forms but universal properties of experiential categories. From a Wittgensteinian perspective, this offers a structural account of what Wittgenstein calls "family resemblance" (PI section 67) --- a universal property need not be a shared feature but rather a structural position (terminal or initial object) that relates to all objects in the category.

## 第一实在
- **Main translation**: first reality; primary reality
- **Alternatives**: the phenomenally given; primal reality
- **Note**: The author's term for phenomena as the irreducible starting point of all knowledge and metaphysical construction. Not ontological realism about phenomena, but a methodological priority: phenomena are what we start with and cannot go behind. In Wittgensteinian terms, this corresponds to the "given" --- "What has to be accepted, the given, is --- so one could say --- forms of life" (PI p. 226). "First reality" is adequate, but a translator's note should clarify the methodological (not ontological) force of "first."

## 第二实在
- **Main translation**: second reality; constructed reality
- **Alternatives**: interpreted reality; derivative reality
- **Note**: The author's term for the "objective world" as a model constructed from phenomena --- the world of stable objects, causal relations, and scientific theories that we build upon the 第一实在. "Second reality" preserves the ordinal structure; "constructed reality" makes the constructive character explicit.

## 第〇实在
- **Main translation**: zeroth reality; ultimate reality
- **Alternatives**: ground reality; absolute reality
- **Note**: The author's term for the hypothetical "thing-in-itself" or "ultimate ground" that the tradition of metaphysics seeks. The author argues this is inaccessible and, when posited, immediately becomes a 第二实在. "Zeroth reality" preserves the mathematical ordering; "ultimate reality" captures the traditional metaphysical sense. The author's point is that there is no such thing as zeroth reality for us --- a point Wittgenstein makes differently in the Tractatus (6.44: "Not *how* the world is, is the mystical, but *that* it is").

## 演化
- **Main translation**: evolution
- **Alternatives**: development; transformation; temporal progression
- **Note**: Used for the evolution functor $T_t: \mathbb{E}_t \to \mathbb{E}_{t+1}$. "Evolution" is adequate and captures both the temporal progression and the structural transformation. Note that $t$ is not necessarily physical time. In Wittgensteinian terms, the evolution of $\mathbb{E}$ corresponds to changes in one's form of life over time --- something Wittgenstein acknowledges but does not formalize.

## 稳定结构
- **Main translation**: stable structure
- **Alternatives**: invariant structure; persistent structure
- **Note**: The author's term for structural features preserved under the evolution functor. $S_E$ is the stable structure of total experience; $S_L$ is the stable structure of language; $S_K$ is the stable structure of the knowledge network. "Stable structure" is clear and direct. In Wittgensteinian terms, stable structures correspond to the "very general facts of nature" (PI p. 230) and to hinge propositions (*On Certainty*) that form the stable framework of our world-picture.

## 张力
- **Main translation**: tension
- **Alternatives**: strain; conflict; irresolution
- **Note**: The author defines 张力 as the state where a sub-category lacks a unique terminal object --- where multiple potential universal properties compete without resolution. This is a structural account of philosophical puzzlement, indecision, and existential unease. "Tension" is adequate. In Wittgensteinian terms, this corresponds to the state of being "entangled in our own rules" (PI section 125) or "held captive by a picture" (PI section 115).

## 内省
- **Main translation**: introspection
- **Alternatives**: self-examination; inner observation
- **Note**: The author uses 内省 as a methodological tool: one can "verify" the categorical structure $\mathcal{E}$ through introspection --- by checking whether the structural relationships match one's felt experience. Wittgenstein is deeply suspicious of introspection as a philosophical method (PI section 580: "An 'inner process' stands in need of outward criteria"). However, the author's use of introspection is more sophisticated: it is not about accessing private objects but about verifying structural positions. This is compatible with Wittgenstein's insistence on public criteria, since the structural positions are in principle publicly describable.

## 主体间性
- **Main translation**: intersubjectivity
- **Alternatives**: intersubjective verification; structural commensurability (in technical contexts)
- **Note**: In the author's framework, intersubjectivity is not grounded in empathy (Husserl), communicative rationality (Habermas), or agreement in form of life (Wittgenstein), but in **structural commensurability via natural transformations**. Two subjects are intersubjectively aligned when their respective natural transformations satisfy the same naturality conditions --- i.e., when their experiential responses are structurally constrained by the same categorical diagrams. The private content of experience drops out as irrelevant (cf. Wittgenstein's beetle-in-the-box, PI section 293); what matters is the structural position. This is perhaps the author's most significant contribution to the intersubjectivity problem. "Intersubjectivity" is standard; in passages where the structural mechanism is foregrounded, "structural commensurability" may be clearer.

## 哲学实验
- **Main translation**: philosophical experiment
- **Alternatives**: experiential experiment; phenomenological experiment
- **Note**: The author's term for the practice of constructing examples with specific categorical structures to awaken specific experiences in readers/participants, then checking whether those experiences are replicable and occupy the predicted structural positions. This has no direct Wittgensteinian equivalent, but parallels Wittgenstein's use of examples as philosophical method (PI section 593) and Austin's method of constructing specific speech-act scenarios. The key difference is that the author proposes *designing experiments in advance* based on categorical structure, whereas Wittgenstein finds examples therapeutically. "Philosophical experiment" is adequate and preserves the author's intended parallel with scientific experimentation.

## 对齐
- **Main translation**: alignment
- **Alternatives**: correspondence; concordance; attunement
- **Note**: Used to describe the relationship between structural evolution and experiential evolution when a natural transformation exists. "Alignment" is clear and non-technical. "Attunement" (*Stimmung*) has Heideggerian resonances that may be appropriate in some contexts. From a Wittgensteinian perspective, alignment corresponds to the state of being "at home" in a language game --- when one's responses naturally fit the game's structure.
