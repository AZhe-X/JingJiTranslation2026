# Q6 - 虚妄 rendering

## Question

In Essay 5 (形而上学后的目的：诗意), the author coins 虚妄 as a personal term (distinct from Buddhist usage). The author's footnote explains:
- 虚 = "without real significance" (没有实在意义的)
- 妄 = "arrogant, self-deceptive" (自大且自我蒙蔽的)

This describes the stance of someone who claims to reject ALL dreamscapes/meaning-structures — the radical nihilist who insists nothing matters. The author argues this is impossible because we are constituted by feeling, and feeling-and-meaning are two sides of one thing.

Current options:
1. **"delusion"** — too Buddhist (moha/痴), and too passive. Misses the arrogance dimension.
2. **"vain presumption"** — captures arrogance + emptiness. Slightly archaic.
3. **"vain delusion"** — combines both. Redundant?
4. **"presumptuous emptiness"** — captures both components but awkward.
5. **"hollow arrogance"** — captures meaning, loses philosophical register.

## Expert Consulted

- **Buddhism expert**: **Confirms NOT Buddhist usage. Recommends "vain presumption."** Key points:
  - Buddhist 虚妄 (mṛṣā/vitatha) = illusory, false, unreal — describes cognitive error about the nature of reality. Descriptive, not moral.
  - Author's 虚妄: shares 虚 (insubstantiality) with Buddhist usage but diverges on 妄 (arrogant pretension vs. cognitive error). Describes an active STANCE, not a passive condition.
  - Risk of conflation is HIGH for Buddhist-literate readers. "Delusion" or "illusion" would be serious mistranslation.
  - "Vain presumption" is best: English "vain" mirrors the double meaning (empty/without substance AND conceited/self-important). "Presumption" = claiming a position one cannot hold. Together = exactly the author's meaning.
  - Against "delusion": passive cognitive error, Buddhist moha. Against "vain delusion": confusing pull in two directions. Against "presumptuous emptiness": "emptiness" is the most dangerous word near Buddhist resonances (空/sunyata). Against "hollow arrogance": newspaper editorial register, not philosophical.
  - Recommends preserving author's footnote in translation with explicit disambiguation from Buddhist 虚妄.

## Resolution

**RESOLVED: 虚妄 = "vain presumption"**

Implementation:
- Render 虚妄 as **"vain presumption"** throughout.
- Preserve the author's footnote defining the term, translated as: "虚妄: a term coined by the author. 虚 (xū): without real substance; 妄 (wàng): arrogant and self-deceptive. Here translated as 'vain presumption' — the empty pretension of claiming to stand outside all meaning-structures. [TN: This is distinct from the Buddhist term 虚妄 (mṛṣā), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption.]"
