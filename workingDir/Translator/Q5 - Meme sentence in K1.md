# Q5 - Meme sentence in K1

## Question

In K1策略, the author uses a Chinese internet meme sentence as an example of a grammatically correct but semantically incomprehensible sentence (to demonstrate the failure of eta/understanding):

> "你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国，记住我给出的原理"

This sentence is a Chinese internet meme (机械降神-style absurdist humor). It is deliberately incomprehensible — that is the philosophical point: the reader experiences the FAILURE of natural transformation (no eta can be constructed).

**Translation challenge**:
- A literal translation would be comprehensible nonsense in English, but would lack the specific cultural recognition that Chinese readers have
- An English meme equivalent (e.g., "Has Anyone Really Been Far Even as Decided to Use Even Go Want to do Look More Like?") would preserve the FUNCTION (experiential failure of understanding) but lose the specific Chinese text
- A translator's note explaining the meme would provide context but can't reproduce the reader's experience of incomprehension

**Options**:
1. Translate literally + translator's note explaining it's a meme
2. Replace with an English equivalent meme + translator's note about the original
3. Keep the Chinese text (romanized) + English equivalent + note
4. Translate literally and trust that the English version will also be incomprehensible enough

## Expert Consulted

- **Wittgenstein expert**: **Recommends Option 2 (English meme replacement + translator's note).** Key reasoning:
  - Primary phenomenon (eta-failure) requires only semantic incomprehension, not cultural recognition. Reader must experience not-understanding as structural event.
  - Secondary phenomenon: author notes you CAN recover understanding through cultural context (internet searching). This requires the sentence to have recoverable cultural meaning, not just be word-salad.
  - Literal translation (Options 1, 4) fails: English reader experiences "bad translation" not "natively incomprehensible sentence." These are different structural positions — the first attributes failure to translation, the second to the sentence itself. Experiment requires the second.
  - Double presentation (Option 3) is pedagogically cluttered at a moment when the reader needs to HAVE an experience, not process metadata.
  - The author's own structural verification criterion applies: English reader's incomprehension need not be qualitatively identical to Chinese reader's, only structurally commensurable (same position: "eta-failure in grammatical category").
  - Caveat: "Has anyone really been far..." may be too well-known — some readers will recognize it and skip to cultural understanding, bypassing the eta-failure experience. Consider a less famous but structurally equivalent sentence.
  - Translator's note should cite the original Chinese meme and explain that both sentences serve the same structural function.

## Resolution

**RESOLVED: Option 2 — Replace with English meme equivalent + translator's note**

Implementation:
- Replace the Chinese meme with an English sentence that is grammatically plausible but semantically untrackable, with recoverable cultural meaning.
- Consider whether "Has anyone really been far..." is too recognizable. May need to find or construct a less famous English equivalent. (Decision deferred to translation phase.)
- Translator's note cites the original Chinese: "The original uses the Chinese internet meme '你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国，记住我给出的原理,' a deliberately absurdist sentence that is grammatically plausible but semantically void. The English equivalent serves the same structural function."
- The "cat jumped on the table" comparison translates straightforwardly: "The cat jumped on the table."
