# Q7 - 形 as 现象 reinterpretation

## Question

In Essay 4 (后形而上学 整理), the author reinterprets 形 in the classical phrase 形而上者谓之道 (from the Xici zhuan / 系辞传). Traditionally, 形 means "visible/manifest form" or "physical shape." The author reinterprets it as 现象 (phenomena in the phenomenological sense).

This is a significant hermeneutical move — it transforms a classical Chinese cosmological distinction (above form / below form) into a phenomenological one (above phenomena / below phenomena). The Chinese philosophy expert notes that this repurposing is "honest" — the author acknowledges it doesn't perfectly fit the original.

**Translation question**: How prominent should the translator's note be?

Options:
1. **Inline note on first occurrence**: "[TN: The author reinterprets 形 (form) in the classical phrase as 现象 (phenomena), transforming the traditional cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. See Translator's Introduction.]"
2. **Footnote only**: A longer explanatory footnote.
3. **Addressed in Translator's Introduction**: A paragraph in the introduction, with only a brief pointer in the text.
4. **No note needed**: The author's own text explains the reinterpretation adequately.

## Expert Consulted

- **Chinese philosophy expert**: Recommends **Option 3 + Option 2 combined** (Translator's Introduction paragraph + footnote at first occurrence). Key reasoning:
  - **Jarring but not scandalous** for readers familiar with Xici zhuan. Noticeable departure, but: (a) the passage has always been somewhat ambiguous across commentators; (b) creative reinterpretation of classics is expected in Chinese tradition. A knowledgeable reader would think "not what it originally meant, but interesting."
  - **Author's self-awareness helps but doesn't fully mitigate**: The acknowledgment comes late (appendix-like section), not at the moment of first introduction. And it is written for Chinese readers who already have the baseline reading — English readers do not.
  - **Western reader with no Xici zhuan knowledge would NOT notice**: They would take the author's reading at face value, assuming 形而上 has always meant "above phenomena." This flattens the author's originality AND misrepresents the tradition. Strongest argument for a note.
  - **Translator's Introduction**: Half-page paragraph explaining that 形而上学 derives from the Xici zhuan, what the traditional reading is, and that the author deliberately reinterprets. Triple duty: introduces key term, signals awareness to sinologists, gives uninformed readers the baseline.
  - **Footnote at first occurrence of the quotation**: Explains the traditional reading, the author's departure, and points to the Introduction. Longer than a typical inline note but shorter than an excursus.
  - Against inline note (Option 1): breaks reading momentum at a critical moment. Against no note (Option 4): fails Western reader entirely.

## Resolution

**RESOLVED: Translator's Introduction paragraph + footnote at first occurrence**

Implementation:
1. **Translator's Introduction**: Include a paragraph explaining that 形而上学 (metaphysics) derives from the Xici zhuan passage 形而上者谓之道, what 形 traditionally means (visible/tangible form), and that the author reinterprets 形 as 现象 (phenomena), transforming a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one.
2. **Footnote** at the first occurrence of the Xici zhuan quotation in Essay 4's translation:
   > [TN: The phrase 形而上者谓之道 comes from the Xici zhuan (Great Commentary on the Book of Changes). In its traditional reading, 形 refers to visible, tangible form, and the passage distinguishes between the intangible principle (道, the Way) above form and concrete implements (器) below it. The author reinterprets 形 as phenomena (现象), transforming this from a cosmological distinction into a phenomenological one. The author acknowledges this departure later in the essay.
