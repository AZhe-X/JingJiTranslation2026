### Table of Contents Notes
- **Two-part structure plus appendix:** Part 1: 上集：鱼 (Fish) — 3 informal essays. Part 2: 下集：渔 (Fishing) — 4 systematic essays. Appendix: scattered thoughts.
- **鱼/渔 metaphor**: "give a fish vs. teach to fish." Part 1 = concrete reflections (fish); Part 2 = methodology (fishing). Load-bearing.
- **Reading order prescribed**: Not chronological, but the given order is recommended. Sequencing is intentional.
- **Part 2 caveat**: Author warns terminology differs from established traditions.
- **Title 境集**: Provisional: romanized "Jing Ji" with translator's note.

### Essay 1: 关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一 — "A Brief Thought on Collective Interest"
Collective interest as emergent (renormalization metaphor). Individual as starting point. Key terms: 重整化 (renormalization), 良定义 (well-defined), 有效存在 (effective existence). Register: colloquial + physics + philosophy. Performative: enacts individual→collective→individual return.

### Essay 2: A Thought on Knowledge (already in English)
JTB collapse: belief is subjective, truth inaccessible, justification reduces to belief. "Knowledge is what each individual believes to be correct." Bob-and-rain examples are load-bearing. Harmonize 现象/phenomena across languages.

### Essay 3: 西西弗斯、班与猫 — "Sisyphus, Work, and Cats"
Absurdity arises only from external meaning-seeking. Three-step gradient: Sisyphus→office worker→cat owner. Cat example is decisive (mundane, no revolt needed). Key terms: 荒谬, 非和谐 (off-tone), 异化, 内生. Sequencing MUST be preserved.

### Essay 4: 后形而上学 整理 — "Post-Metaphysics: A Compilation"
Methodological core. 前/后形而上学 (pre/post-metaphysics). Three Realities (第一/二/〇实在). 恒常 (constancy). 道德仁义礼 reversal. 非理性 (non-rational). 形而上 vs 形而上学 distinction is load-bearing.

### Essay 5: 形而上学后的目的：诗意 — "The Purpose After Metaphysics: The Poetic"
梦境 (dreamscape). 沉醉 (intoxicated) vs 清醒 (lucid). 诗意 = THE central challenge: lucid engagement with meaning-structures. 感受 and 意义 as 两面一体.

### Essay 6: 范畴论与境 整理 — "Category Theory and Jing"
Formal backbone. P = phenomena, E = jing (category on P). Tower structure. 联想 = association = morphism. 形而上 = universal property. Ship of Theseus resolved. Magic book examples (playful register).

### Essay 7: K1策略 — "Category Theory and Jing: The K1 Strategy"
Evolution functors, stable structures, natural transformations = understanding. η = felt confirmation. "1+1=2" example. Language games. Philosophical experiments. Meme sentence needs note.

### Essay 8 (Appendix): 零散想法 — "Some Scattered Thoughts on Poiesis and Jing"
Human condition as non-tragic. Coin-flipping as poiesis. Death as transcendent. Category theory as one tool among many. Mencius + Socrates frame collection.

### Cross-Cutting Observations
1. Individual as starting point across all essays
2. 现象/Phenomena as consistent anchor term
3. Physics metaphors carry philosophical weight (author is physicist)
4. Bilingual collection (Essay 2 in English)
5. Progression: ontology → epistemology → existential → formal methodology
6. 境集 IS itself a philosophical experiment
7. Key chain: 现象→境→联想→形而上→形而上学→诗意→实践
8. Working draft quality (todos, self-corrections) = philosophical honesty

## Workflow Steps

**Step 2**: Read the 9 expert Analysis Reports (skip dictionaries). Add notes to your Memo.md under "## Expert Report Notes". Reports are at:
- `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Metaphysics/Analysis Report.md`
- `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Phenomenology/Analysis Report.md`
- `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Epistemology/Analysis Report.md`
- `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Existentialism/Analysis Report.md`
- `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Philosophy of Mind/Analysis Report.md`
- `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Kantian/Analysis Report.md`
- `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Chinese Philosophy/Analysis Report.md`
- `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Buddhism/Analysis Report.md`
- `/Users/el/Dropbox/10.Kernel/11.Vault/Tower/L. Legenravend/49 Workspace/Wittgenstein/Analysis Report.md`

**Step 3**: After reading all reports, write an "## Overall Translation Approach" section in Memo.md.

**Step 4**: Create question files (Q1, Q2, etc.) for anything you need to discuss with experts. Each gets its own file in your directory.

**Step 5**: Send questions to experts one at a time using SendMessage, wait for response, record in the question file, then send the next.

**IMPORTANT**:
- Do NOT re-read the source essays (your memo covers them). Only re-read specific passages if needed for a question.
- Do NOT read dictionaries (we'll discuss those later entry by entry).
- Read expert reports efficiently — focus on insights relevant to TRANSLATION, not their full analytical framework.
- Send questions ONE AT A TIME. Wait for the response before sending the next.
- When you go idle waiting for a response, that's fine — you'll be woken up when the response arrives.
