# Glossary-Introduction

These essays develop a distinctive philosophical vocabulary. Several of the author's key terms depart from established usage in both Chinese and Western philosophy. The glossary that follows provides a full listing; here we explain the most consequential decisions.

## Jing (境) and E

The central term is left in romanized Chinese, as discussed in the Translator's Preface. In technical passages, we follow the author's notation and write **E**. The symbol carries its own resonances: the author notes that E stands for Enclosed, Emotion, and Experience.

## The Metaphysical (形而上) vs. Metaphysics (形而上学)

The author draws a sharp distinction between 形而上 (the metaphysical -- a constructed framework above phenomena) and 形而上学 (metaphysics -- the discipline or study of such constructions). This distinction is load-bearing: one can engage in the metaphysical (constructing structures upon phenomena) without doing metaphysics (systematically studying those constructions as a discipline). We render the first as "the metaphysical" and the second as "metaphysics," and maintain this distinction throughout.

## Phenomena (现象)

The author uses 现象 to denote the indubitable starting point of all inquiry -- phenomena as directly given in experience. While this shares ground with both Kant's empirical realism (phenomena are real, not "mere" appearances) and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (back to the things themselves), the author's treatment is distinctive: phenomena are not structured by a fixed transcendental apparatus (as in Kant) nor accessed through a specialized method of epoché (as in Husserl), but are the raw, pre-theoretical ground upon which all conceptual construction occurs. "Phenomena" is used consistently across all essays and is the terminological anchor of the collection.

## Constancy (恒常)

The drive to identify and fix repeated patterns in phenomena -- the engine of all metaphysical construction. "Constancy" was chosen over "permanence" (too ontologically strong -- it implies the patterns truly are permanent), "regularity" (too weak -- it misses the affective and motivational character of the drive), and "invariance" (too narrowly mathematical). The author's 恒常 is an epistemological and existential concept: it names what we seek and provisionally fix in phenomena -- patterns that are constructed, not discovered as eternal truths.

## The Non-Rational (非理性)

The author identifies the foundational drive behind metaphysical construction -- the drive for constancy, for meaning, for structure -- as non-rational (非理性). This means it lies *outside* the scope of rational justification, not that it is *against* reason. To translate 非理性 as "irrational" would import connotations of unreason, madness, or error that the author explicitly rejects. The non-rational is the acknowledged ground upon which all rational activity takes place.

## The Poetic (诗意)

The author's central positive proposal: the existential stance of lucid engagement with meaning-structures -- fully invested in them while fully aware that they are constructed. 诗意 (*shiyi*) is rendered as "the Poetic" (capitalized when used as a substantive, as one would write "the Aesthetic" or "the Sublime") and "poetic" (lowercase) when used adjectivally.

"The Poetic" is not poetry in the literary sense, nor aesthetic appreciation, nor romantic sentimentality. It is a mode of being: the lucid dreamscape (清醒的梦境) as opposed to the intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境) of uncritical faith. The author arrives at this concept independently, through the exhaustion of metaphysics rather than through meditation on language and poetry.

To make this concrete: the author's example of coin-flipping as a decision strategy is an instance of the Poetic. When you cannot choose between two options, you flip a coin -- but you must genuinely invest in the result for the strategy to work. The moment the coin lands, you discover what you actually wanted. You have constructed a temporary meaning-structure (the coin-flip as binding decision), entered it lucidly (knowing it is constructed), and through that engagement, arrived at genuine self-knowledge. This is the Poetic in miniature: active construction of a Jing, lucid inhabitation of it, and real experiential yield.

Readers familiar with Heidegger will recognize an affinity with "poetic dwelling" (*dichterisch wohnen*), but the author's Poetic emphasizes active construction over receptive inhabitation, and is more agentic than Heidegger's *Gelassenheit*.

## Dreamscape (梦境)

The author's initial metaphorical name for the Jing concept: a structured experiential environment in which meaning becomes possible. "Dreamscape" preserves the dream metaphor (essential for the intoxicated/lucid distinction) while the "-scape" suffix signals a constructed environment with its own topology -- not a literal dream, but a field one inhabits. The Diamond Sutra's dream-simile (*rupam svapnopamam*, form is like a dream) provides a useful cross-reference: experientially real while occurring, not necessarily grounded in anything beyond the experience itself, functional within its own terms. (The author does not commit to the Madhyamaka ontology of the Diamond Sutra; the parallel is structural, not doctrinal.)

## Vain Presumption (虚妄)

The author uses 虚妄 as a personal term to describe the stance of the radical nihilist who claims to stand outside all meaning-structures. 虚 = without real substance; 妄 = arrogant and self-deceptive. English "vain" mirrors the Chinese double meaning (empty *and* conceited); "presumption" captures the claim to an impossible standpoint. This is *not* the Buddhist 虚妄 (*mrsa*), which refers to cognitive illusion rather than existential presumption. A footnote at first occurrence disambiguates.

## The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Sequence

In Essay 4, the author analyzes a passage from Laozi's *Daodejing* (Ch. 38) to demonstrate how the metaphysical is constructed from phenomena in reverse. The five terms -- 道 (Dao, the Way), 德 (De), 仁 (Ren), 义 (Yi), 礼 (Li) -- are romanized and glossed on first occurrence.

A critical departure: 德 (*de*) is rendered as "character" in the author's analysis, not "virtue." The author reconceives 德 as constitutive character -- the defining characteristics that make a thing what it is, assembled bottom-up from phenomena rather than imposed top-down from metaphysical principle. In the block-quoted Laozi passage itself, where the traditional reading is in view, we render 德 as "virtue" (following established translation conventions). A translator's note marks the shift.

The remaining terms depart from common translations for specific reasons: 仁 (*ren*) is rendered as "humaneness" rather than the more common "benevolence" (following Ames and Rosemont), because the author emphasizes the inner felt experience of fellow-feeling before any outward action -- "benevolence" connotes charitable giving, which is too external. 义 (*yi*) is rendered as "rightness" rather than "righteousness," because the author treats it as a motivational disposition (the felt impulse connecting inner feeling to action), not a moralistic or absolutist judgment. 礼 (*li*) is rendered as "ritual conduct" rather than "rites" or "propriety," emphasizing the observable behavioral dimension that the author takes as the phenomenal starting point.

The author's neologisms -- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual conduct), 现象仁 (phenomenal humaneness), 现象义 (phenomenal rightness) -- are preserved with the "phenomenal" prefix always attached. The distinction between "humaneness" (the classical concept) and "phenomenal humaneness" (the author's coinage for the felt experience as it actually occurs in phenomena) is load-bearing for the argument. Readers should watch for the moment when the author shows how an inductively observed *property* (something people happen to have) is silently transformed into a normative *definition* (what people must be) -- this reversal from property to definition is perhaps the collection's most original philosophical move, and it recurs throughout.

Note that the reader will encounter two different English words for the same Chinese character within a single passage: 德 appears as "virtue" when quoting Laozi and as "character" when the author analyzes the concept. This is deliberate, not an inconsistency -- it reflects the author's argument that the traditional reading (virtue, imposed from above) conceals the constructive process (character, assembled from below).

## Three Realities

The author introduces a numbered schema of realities:

- **First Reality** (第一实在): phenomena as directly given -- the indubitable starting point.
- **Second Reality** (第二实在): the concepts, models, and structures we construct upon phenomena.
- **Zeroth Reality** (第〇实在): whatever may lie behind phenomena -- unreachable, and the moment it is articulated, it becomes Second Reality.

The numbering is epistemic, not ontological: "First" means "first in the order of our access," not "most fundamental in the order of being." Readers familiar with Kant will notice that Zeroth Reality resembles the *Ding an sich* (thing-in-itself), but with a decisive difference: for Kant, the thing-in-itself is a necessary limiting concept that philosophy cannot do without; for this author, Zeroth Reality is genuinely dispensable -- one can do all of philosophy, and live, without ever invoking it.

## Stable Structures (稳定结构)

Patterns that persist as a Jing evolves over time -- the author's empirical replacement for a priori categories. Where Kant deduces the categories of understanding from the table of judgments, the author treats stable structures as discovered through experience and subject to revision: they are what survives the evolution of a Jing, not what precedes it. In mathematical contexts, these are denoted **S_E**.

## Natural Transformations and Understanding (自然变换 / 理解)

The collection's most technically innovative contribution: the author formalizes "understanding" as a natural transformation (a standard concept in category theory) between two Jing-structures. When two people understand each other, or when a reader understands a text, what occurs is a structural alignment -- a systematic mapping that preserves associations. The felt confirmation that understanding has occurred is denoted **eta** (η). When eta is an identity morphism -- when no mediation is needed -- the author calls this **mastery** (掌握, *zhangwo*). This formalization provides a precise, non-mysterious account of intersubjectivity: shared understanding does not require shared inner experience, only structural alignment.

## Other Terms

**联想** (*lianxiang*): "association" -- the experiential links between phenomena that serve as morphisms in **E**. **感受** (*ganshou*): "feeling" or "felt experience" -- broader than sensation, encompassing affect, meaning-feeling, and the felt quality of inhabiting a Jing. **体验** (*tiyan*): "experience" in its processual, immersive sense -- not detached observation but undergoing something firsthand. **祛魅** (*qumei*): "disenchantment" (Weber's *Entzauberung*). **非和谐**: "the off-tone" -- both the Chinese term and its English gloss are the author's own coinages; "the off-tone" is not a translator's choice but the author's original English. **演化**: "evolution" (temporal development, not biological).
