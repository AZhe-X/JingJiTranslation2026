# Sisyphus, Work, and the Cat

About a year ago, I discussed absurdism with a friend. We were both puzzled by it, and she even read [*The Myth of Sisyphus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus) specifically to work through it. In fact, it is a rather literary book — so much so that we seemed even more confused afterward.

We seemed to arrive at a conclusion something like this: absurdity describes a situation where, when a person seeks meaning externally (from the universe) and receives no answer, a dissonance arises between one's own state and "the unanswering state of the universe" — an off-tone, a misalignment — and from this one feels (a cosmic-level) absurdity.

But my intuitive response is: this is because you asked the wrong question! Meaning is generated from within a person, not received from outside — there is no meaning in the universe at all, so you should never have sought meaning externally in the first place. Of course you feel absurd — you are looking for something in a place where that thing does not exist. It's as if you dropped your watch at home, but to find it you keep exploring places you've never been — of course that feels absurd!

To illustrate this point, let us revisit the standard metaphor for this situation: Sisyphus.

> In Greek mythology, Sisyphus was condemned to roll a boulder up a mountain, only for it to roll back down when it reached the top; he would repeat this forever. Camus believed that Sisyphus knew full well the meaninglessness of rolling the stone, yet he persisted; in his revolt, Sisyphus was both desperate and fulfilled, happy. ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus))

But perhaps a more familiar scenario is this: there is a college student who spent long years studying and finally graduated and found a job. When he goes to work, he feels satisfied and happy: he believes he is contributing to society, making the world a better place — or at least he is on a path to wealth and the pinnacle of life. But as the long days pass, he gradually realizes that, day after day, nothing really changes. He seems to have a better life — promotions, raises, a car, a nicer apartment — but then again, maybe not: every day he goes to the office (perhaps now driving instead of taking the subway), faces different bosses and clients (the boss — the boss got promoted too, still his boss), comes home at night too exhausted to do anything but collapse into bed, and every month calculates how to allocate the balance in his account. Then one day, he asks himself: what is the meaning of work? He thinks back to the dreams he had when he first left university, reviews the days of exhausting labor without real change, and he feels — absurd.

In this example, the daily grind of work is the process of pushing the stone, and pushing the stone is (cosmically) meaningless, just as he ultimately asks: what is the meaning of work? Unfortunately for him, whereas Sisyphus returned to a state of "fulfillment" through his revolt against the absurd, the person in this example has not yet —

But wait. What if we look at it differently? What if he is not working for someone else, but starting his own business to pursue what he wants to do? In fact, the situation has not changed — his living conditions might even be worse than when he was employed — but obviously he would not feel absurd for this reason (though he might feel absurd for other reasons), because as long as the business is still something he wants to do, he will never question the meaning of his work. In this example, the so-called absurdity, the so-called dissonance, has its real source in *alienation* — because he is not actually working for himself; the meaning of his work has been externalized. When he works for himself, this dissonance has nowhere to arise, because there is no misalignment: I myself generate an internalized goal (meaning), and I work and strive for myself. I need not seek meaning from the outside at all.

We see that when a person no longer seeks meaning externally, absurdity dissolves naturally, as if it had never come. In fact, in the Sisyphus example, the essence is the same: "revolt against the absurd" is itself a kind of internally generated meaning. Why should we consider Sisyphus happy? Because, facing the gods and the universe — these "transcendent" external existences — Sisyphus regenerated an internal goal from within, only this goal was directed outward (toward the "transcendent").

In fact, even the office-job example is too "dramatic," because many people's entrepreneurial goals are still externally directed — that is, they still have "transcendence." Let us consider this example instead: many people have raised cats. Raising a cat is a complicated, tiring thing. You must constantly monitor the cat's health; you must deal with the ways the cat sometimes interferes with the rest of your life. Think about it: in the morning, you are woken by the cat's meowing, drag yourself out of your warm bed to prepare cat food; in the evening, you may need to change the litter. When cleaning, you face cat hair everywhere, and furniture the cat has scratched up. But no one who raises a cat feels absurd — absurdity never even arrives. In fact, in this scenario, there is no opportunity for absurdity to exist at all; no cat owner would even connect cat-raising with absurdity.

Yet we can still see that raising a cat is really no different from pushing a stone. But raising a cat is itself happiness; raising a cat itself has immanent meaning — and we do not even need to explicitly, rationally articulate this meaning; we naturally feel satisfaction in the process of raising a cat. Raising a cat involves no transcendent meaning, neither internally generated nor externally given, and requires no dramatic confrontation with cosmic absurdity. Raising a cat is simply because — simply because we want to raise a cat, we like living with a cat, and that is all.

## Translator's Notes

[^TN1]: *班* (bān): The Chinese title "西西弗斯、班与猫" uses 班, a colloquial term for "going to work," "the daily job," or "one's shift." The title thus juxtaposes three images: the mythic figure condemned to eternal labor, the mundane reality of the daily grind, and the domestic contentment of cat ownership. "Work" captures the everyday, non-heroic quality of 班 better than "labor" or "toil."

[^TN2]: The cat example is philosophically crucial. Unlike Sisyphus, who requires heroic revolt to recover meaning, and unlike the office worker, who must reframe his labor as entrepreneurship, the cat owner never encounters absurdity at all. Meaning is not recovered or constructed — it simply *is*, immanently, without needing articulation. This dissolves the Camusian problematic rather than resolving it.
