# A Little Thought on Collective Interest, Part One

Today I have some thoughts on collective interest.

An initial thought is that collective interest seems not to exist. When we speak of acting "for the collective," if what we mean is acting for the majority of people in a group, then so-called collective interest is essentially the individual interests of the majority within that group. It is hard to imagine what "the interest of the collective" could really be, since the interests of the collective ultimately reduce to the interests of each individual person within it. To speak of collective interest is therefore rather strange — especially when these collective interests are themselves highly abstract entities.

However, upon closer reflection, this is not quite right. If we treat individual interest as a concept at the micro level and collective interest as a concept at the macro level, we immediately recognize that macro-level concepts are a kind of *effective existence* — just as renormalization derives low-energy effective interactions from high-energy interactions.[^TN1]

That is to say, the earlier skepticism is essentially asking: can concepts like society or collective (interest), relative to the micro level of human individuals, be well-defined at the macro level? We need only reframe the question as: can concepts like the human individual (or their bodily health), relative to the micro level of each individual cell in the human body, be well-defined as macro-level phenomena? The answer becomes clear. The question is not whether some objective macro-level entity exists, but rather **whether, at the macro level, a group can be cognized as a whole**. If we understand the macro level as a renormalization of the micro level, the answer appears to be yes.

To make this easier to grasp, consider the following example: in the ocean, each water molecule has its own pattern of motion, but viewed macroscopically, the waves of the sea exhibit an entirely different pattern of motion that *emerges* from the microscopic motion of the water molecules. Clearly, the ocean's pattern of motion can be cognized at the macro level, and this pattern of motion "objectively" exists (in the way that mathematics does). Thus collective interest can certainly be defined — just as we can attempt to describe the properties of the ocean.

The reason the earlier question arises is that, as human individuals, we can only set out from the position of human individuals and return to that same position. This is not to say that human individuals cannot understand others or understand society; rather, human individuals possess the physiological basis of being human individuals, but do not possess the structural basis of being society itself. Humans can never truly know the real thoughts of others, and even less can they know society as such: human individuals can only attempt to understand others and society through the physiology and thinking of a human individual. A human individual cannot take a stand upon something that transcends themselves.[^1]

Furthermore, it is precisely *because* human individuals can only set out from themselves that empathy becomes possible — that human individuals have any chance of understanding others at all. If we were to set out from the perspective of the human group (as a whole), then just as human individuals cannot understand the joys and sorrows of their cells, the human group (as a whole) would have only a limited understanding of the joys and sorrows of human individuals. In other words, it is **only** because we are human individuals that we **can** truly have a chance to understand the joys and sorrows of other human individuals. Our understanding of others naturally proceeds from ourselves as human individuals, and it is because we all proceed from ourselves that we can understand one another.[^2]

However, unlike human individuals, laws and regulations in their concrete implementation act upon micro-level human individuals and thereby affect the macro-level group — because they act upon a large range of human individuals. If the physical laws that each water molecule obeys were to change, the motion pattern of the ocean would change accordingly. Thus things like laws, which affect large numbers of human individuals, can be understood as entities that transcend micro-level individuals — even though what they concretely affect is each micro-level individual — just as temperature transcends individual water molecules. It is precisely for this reason that we can discuss how laws and regulations balance individual and collective interests, because it is at this level that collective interest is well-defined.

> **A question:** Can human nature, in some sense, also be defined at the macro level in the same way?

Finally, even commonly discussed individual interest should perhaps be understood as an abstract concept derived through renormalization. I hope to think more clearly about this point in the future. Notice that many abstract concepts seem to be the result of renormalization — abstraction and renormalization seem to be connected. When I use the term "renormalization," I want to emphasize again that the phenomena obtained through renormalization are real and concrete. Thus the sense of emptiness that once accompanied abstract concepts — the feeling that they could not be firmly grasped — can be entirely swept away. Just as I can write down the equations of motion for water molecules, I can also concretely describe the patterns of motion of the ocean. The ocean's pattern of motion is real and concrete (in the way mathematics is) — *it can be observed and cognized*. I also want to emphasize that renormalization is a continuous process: just as the scale change from atoms to DNA to cells to hair is "continuous," the phenomena obtained through renormalization are also continuous across different scales. Applied to groups, different scales of groups are the results of renormalization at different scales — family, community, a people, all the way to humanity as a whole — and new phenomena may emerge at different scales.

## Footnotes

[^1]: In fact, it is only by standing upon oneself that transcending oneself can be defined at all.

[^2]: Similarly, human individuals can ultimately only return to being human individuals, because all the effects they ultimately experience are limited to their existence as human individuals — just as what we can truly control and feel is ultimately only our own bodies and minds. Even if a human individual foresees that they will have a profound impact on all other people, for them, the ultimate realization of this impact must return to themselves. Even from the perspective of purpose (which we call interest), it is ultimately because I believe this action will conform to some interest of mine, and all other considerations — such as group interests and so forth — can only be means to arrive at my interest. Even if my interest may be to ensure the survival and interests of others.

## Translator's Notes

[^TN1]: *Renormalization* (重整化): a technique from theoretical physics (particularly quantum field theory) in which high-energy, short-distance behavior is systematically integrated out to yield effective low-energy descriptions. The author uses this as a conceptual metaphor: just as fundamental interactions at one scale give rise to qualitatively different but equally real effective interactions at another scale, phenomena at the micro level (individual cells, individual persons) give rise to equally real phenomena at the macro level (bodily health, collective interest). The term "effective" here carries its physics meaning: not "merely apparent" but "genuinely operative at that scale." This essay uses the renormalization metaphor to argue that collective interest is not a fiction but an *effective existence* — real at the macro scale even though it emerges from individual interests at the micro scale.
