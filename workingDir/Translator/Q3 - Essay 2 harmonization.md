# Q3 - Essay 2 harmonization

## Question

"A Thought on Knowledge" (Essay 2) is already written in English by the author. The translation project covers the 7 Chinese essays. But terminological consistency matters:

1. Essay 2 uses "phenomena" — this aligns with our rendering of 现象. Good.
2. Essay 2 uses "belief" — aligns with 信念. Good.
3. Essay 2 does not use 境, 形而上, 恒常, or other technical terms from Part 2. No conflict.
4. Essay 2's register is more formal/analytic than the Chinese essays. Is this a feature (bilingual diversity) or a problem (inconsistency)?

**Key question**: Should we leave Essay 2 entirely untouched, or make minor adjustments (e.g., adding a translator's note about how "phenomena" in this essay connects to 现象 in the Chinese essays)?

## Expert Consulted

- **Epistemology expert**: Detailed response. Key points:
  - **Do not edit the author's English.** But add a short translator's note (footnote or prefatory paragraph) covering three connections: (1) "phenomena" = 现象 = First Reality = P; (2) "digestion" anticipates the functor structure in K1; (3) three justification bases map onto K1 framework.
  - **Register difference is a feature — preserve it.** Essay 2's analytic register vs. Essays 1/3's 随笔 register demonstrates the very point about different 境 (sub-categories of experience). Smoothing would erase this demonstration. Do not try to match Essay 2's register in translated Chinese essays.
  - **Three terms warrant translator's footnotes**: (1) "Digestion" — predecessor of the embedding functor. (2) "What each individual believes to be correct" — predecessor of the knowledge sub-category (E_K)_t. (3) "Standard" (in "Knowledge in motion" sidenote) — predecessor of stable structure S_K.
  - Do NOT footnote "phenomena," "belief," or "truth" — standard philosophical English, footnoting would be patronizing. The prefatory note is sufficient for terminological continuity.

## Resolution

**RESOLVED: Leave Essay 2 untouched + add minimal apparatus**

1. **Do not edit the author's English text.**
2. **Add a brief translator's prefatory note** (3-4 sentences) at the essay's opening, connecting "phenomena" to 现象/First Reality, noting that "digestion" anticipates the formal functor structure, and flagging the three justification bases as precursors to the K1 framework.
3. **Add three translator's footnotes** on specific terms: "digestion," "what each individual believes to be correct," and "standard" — connecting each to its formal counterpart in the later essays.
4. **Preserve the register difference** as a feature of the bilingual collection. Do not smooth the translated Chinese essays toward Essay 2's analytic register.
