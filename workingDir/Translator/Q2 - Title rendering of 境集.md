# Q2 - Title rendering of 境集

## Question

The collection title 境集 needs an English rendering for the cover page and running headers. Options:

1. **"Jing Ji"** — Pure romanization. Treats 境 as untranslatable (like "Dao De Jing"). Needs subtitle.
2. **"Jing Ji: Collected Essays on Jing"** — Romanization + explanatory subtitle. Redundant (集 = collected).
3. **"Jing Ji: Essays on the Structure of Experience"** — Romanization + descriptive subtitle.
4. **"Collected Jing"** — Partial translation (集 = collected). Concise.
5. **"The Jing Collection"** — English syntax.

Sub-question: Should the subtitle hint at the content (philosophy, experience, meaning) or remain neutral?

## Expert Consulted

- **Chinese philosophy expert**: Detailed response. Key points:
  - 集 is the most neutral genre marker — neither grand-scholarly (经, 论) nor casual (笔记). Middle register: serious but not pretentious. English equivalent: "Essays" or "Writings," not "Collected Works" or "Papers."
  - 境集 follows classical two-character [concept]+[genre] pattern (cf. 道德经, 论语). Weight falls entirely on 境; 集 is deliberately modest. Author does NOT call it 境论 (treatise) or 境学 (study) — signals gathered writings, not systematic treatise.
  - **No descriptive subtitle recommended.** Descriptive subtitles import vocabulary the author builds toward, frame expectations prematurely, and undermine the experimental function. Best Chinese titles let the reader discover content. If subtitle absolutely needed: "Eight Essays" or "Essays in Three Parts" (structural, not descriptive).
  - **Keep 境 untranslated as "Jing"** — same logic as leaving 道 as "Dao." Preserves productive ambiguity (境界, 意境, 梦境, 环境 all activated for Chinese reader). Any English translation collapses to one meaning.
  - Recommended rendering: **"Jing Ji"** with translator's preface introducing 境. If publisher requires more: **"Jing Ji: Essays on Jing"** where "Jing" is treated like "Dao" — a term the reader is expected to learn.

## Resolution

**RESOLVED: 境集 = "Jing Ji"**

Primary title: **Jing Ji** (romanized, no subtitle)
If subtitle required by publisher: **Jing Ji: Essays on Jing**
Translator's introduction will explain 境 and its multiple resonances.
Running headers: "Jing Ji"
The term 境 is treated like Dao or Dasein — a foreign philosophical term the English reader learns through the text.
