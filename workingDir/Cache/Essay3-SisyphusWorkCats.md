# Sisyphus, Work, and Cats

About a year ago, a friend and I found ourselves discussing absurdism. We were both puzzled by it, and she had gone so far as to read [*The Myth of Sisyphus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus) for the occasion. In fact, it is a remarkably literary book — so much so that we seemed only more lost after reading it.

We seemed to arrive at something like the following conclusion: absurdity describes a situation in which a person seeks meaning from the outside — from the universe — and receives no answer. When this happens, an off-tone (非和谐, *feihexie*) emerges between one's own condition and the universe's unanswering silence, a kind of dislocation, and from this one feels a (cosmic-scale) sense of the absurd.[^TN1]

But my gut reaction was: that is because you are asking the wrong question! Meaning is generated from within a person, not received from without — there is simply no meaning in the universe to be found, so you should never have been looking outward for it in the first place. Of course you feel absurd — you are searching for something in a place where that something does not exist. It is as though you dropped your watch at home but keep searching for it by exploring places you have never been — of course that feels absurd!

To illustrate this, let us return to the standard metaphor for this predicament: Sisyphus.

> In Greek mythology, Sisyphus is condemned to push a boulder up a mountain, only for it to roll back down each time he reaches the summit; he will repeat this act forever. Camus held that Sisyphus, fully aware of the meaninglessness of his labor, persists nonetheless, and that in this revolt Sisyphus is despairing yet fulfilled and happy. ([Source](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E8%A5%BF%E7%BB%AA%E5%BC%97%E6%96%AF%E7%A5%9E%E8%AF%9D))

But perhaps a more familiar case is the following. A college student endures the long years of study, finally graduates, and finds a job. When he starts working, he feels satisfied and happy: he believes he is contributing to society, making the world a better place — or at least that he is on a path toward wealth and the peak of his career. But as the long days pass, he gradually realizes that nothing has really changed. He seems to be living a better life — promotions, raises, a car, a nicer apartment — and yet it also seems as though nothing is different: every day he commutes to the office (perhaps he has traded the subway for his own car), faces different bosses and clients (bosses — his boss was promoted too, and is still his boss), comes home at night too exhausted to do anything but collapse into bed, and spends each month calculating how to allocate what remains in his account. Then one day he asks himself: what is the meaning of going to work? He recalls the dreams he had when he first walked out of college, he surveys the daily grind that has brought no real change, and he feels — absurd.

In this example, the daily repetition of work is the act of pushing the boulder, and pushing the boulder is (cosmically) meaningless, just as his final question — what is the meaning of going to work? — makes plain. Unfortunately, whereas Sisyphus, through his revolt against the absurd, returns to a state of "fulfillment," the person in the example above has not yet —

But wait. What if we look at this differently? What if, instead of working for someone else, he had started a business doing something he wanted to do? In fact the circumstances may be no different — his material conditions may even be worse than they were as an employee — but clearly he will not feel absurd for this reason (though he may feel absurd for other reasons), because as long as the business is still pursuing what he wants to pursue, he will never question the meaning of his work. In fact, in this example, the so-called absurdity, the so-called off-tone, has its real source in alienation — because in fact he was not working for himself; the meaning of work had been externalized.[^TN2] When he works for himself, the off-tone has nowhere to arise, because there is no dislocation: I myself generate an internalized goal (meaning) and work toward it for my own sake; I have no need to seek meaning from the outside.

We see, then, that when a person no longer seeks meaning externally, the absurd dissolves of its own accord, as though it had never been there at all. In fact, in the case of Sisyphus, the underlying logic is the same: "revolt against the absurd" is itself, in fact, a kind of internally generated meaning. Why should we say that Sisyphus is happy? Because, faced with the gods and the universe — those "transcendent" external presences — Sisyphus regenerates an internal goal from within. It is only that this goal happens to be directed outward (against the "transcendent").

In fact, even the example of the office worker is too "dramatic," because many people's entrepreneurial goals are still directed outward — that is, they still possess "transcendence." Let us consider a different example: many people have kept cats. Keeping a cat is a complicated, exhausting affair. You must constantly monitor the cat's health; you must deal with the ways the cat sometimes disrupts the rest of your life. Think about it: in the morning, you are woken by the cat's meowing and drag yourself out of a warm bed to prepare its food; in the evening, you may need to change the litter. When you clean the house, you face cat hair everywhere and furniture the cat has clawed to pieces. And yet no one who keeps a cat has ever felt absurd about it — the absurd has never even come close. In fact, in this situation, there is simply no opening for absurdity to exist; it has never even occurred to a cat owner to connect keeping a cat with the absurd.

And yet we can still see that keeping a cat is, in fact, no different from pushing a boulder. But keeping a cat is in itself a source of happiness; keeping a cat possesses internally generated meaning all on its own.[^TN3] We do not even need to explicitly invoke reason to articulate this meaning — we simply feel satisfaction in the course of caring for the cat. Keeping a cat has no transcendent meaning, neither internally generated nor externally imposed, and it requires no dramatic confrontation with the absurdity of the universe. Keeping a cat is simply — simply because we want to keep a cat, because we like living with a cat, and that is all.

## Translator's Notes

[^TN1]: 非和谐 (*feihexie*) — literally "non-harmony" — and its English gloss "off-tone" are both the author's own coinages. Neither term exists in standard Chinese philosophical vocabulary. The parenthetical "(off-tone)" in the original Chinese text is the author's own English, preserved here. The concept recurs in the formal essays of Part 2, where it is given precise characterization. See Glossary.

[^TN2]: 异化 (*yihua*) carries its full Marxist resonance here: the worker's labor, and the meaning of that labor, has been transferred to an external party. The author is drawing a structural parallel between Marxist alienation and the existentialist concept of absurdity: both arise from the externalization of something that is properly internal.

[^TN3]: 内生 (*neisheng*) — "internally generated" or "endogenous." The term carries connotations from both economics (endogenous growth) and biology (endogenous processes). In the author's usage, it denotes meaning that arises from within the activity itself, without reference to any external source or justification. This concept is developed formally in Part 2 as a property of certain Jing-structures.
