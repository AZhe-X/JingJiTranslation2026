## Overall Assessment: **Good**

The translation preserves the epistemological core of the argument: the access-based reasoning about how we cognize macro-level phenomena from our micro-level position.

---

## Strengths

### 1. Access Argument Preserved
The crucial epistemological move — that we can only set out from ourselves as individuals, and this is what *enables* rather than blocks understanding — comes through clearly. Footnote [^1] captures this perfectly: "it is only by standing upon oneself that transcending oneself can be defined at all."

### 2. Well-Defined Question Properly Framed
The reframing from "does a macro entity exist?" to "can a group be cognized as a whole?" is preserved. This is the correct epistemological orientation — the question is about *cognizability*, not ontology.

### 3. Renormalization Metaphor Effective
The TN on renormalization is helpful and accurate. The key insight — that "effective" means "genuinely operative at that scale" rather than "merely apparent" — is exactly right. This addresses potential misreadings where readers might think macro-level phenomena are somehow less real.

### 4. Footnote [^2] Preserves Self-Return Structure
The point that all understanding ultimately returns to oneself (even concern for others is *my* concern for others) captures an important phenomenological-epistemological insight about the structure of intentionality.

## Minor Observations

### 1. "Well-defined" (良定义)
The term is correct but technical. General readers may not know it's a term of art from mathematics/logic meaning "unambiguously specified" or "coherently constructed." Consider whether this needs glossing, or whether context makes it clear.

**Verdict:** Probably fine — the ocean example immediately demonstrates what "well-defined at the macro level" means in practice.

### 2. "Objectively exists (in the way mathematics does)"
This phrase is philosophically careful but also somewhat ambiguous. Mathematical platonism vs. nominalism is contested terrain. The author seems to be gesturing at "real but not material" — the parenthetical softens the ontological claim appropriately.

**Verdict:** Keep as is — the ambiguity may be intentional, and the author explicitly brackets ontological questions elsewhere.

### 3. Question Box Preserved
The "A question" callout about human nature is preserved. This is good — it shows the author's exploratory, generative thinking style.

---

## No Changes Recommended

The draft is epistemologically sound. The key moves are preserved:
- Access to macro phenomena is through micro phenomena, but the macro is real
- Cognition/well-definedness question replaces existence question
- Self-grounding of understanding (we understand others because we proceed from ourselves)
- The "effective" sense of renormalized phenomena (not "merely apparent")
