# Translation Dictionary for Epistemology Expert
## Jing-Translation Team

This dictionary provides epistemologically-grounded translations for key terms in the 境集 collection, with attention to their roles in theories of knowledge, justification, and epistemic structure.

## 知识
- **Main translation**: knowledge
- **Alternatives**:
  - "belief taken to be correct" (when emphasizing the author's deflationary analysis)
  - "what is believed to be knowledge" (in contexts emphasizing epistemic relativism)
- **Note**: The author radically redefines 知识 by collapsing the JTB tripartite analysis. Through the "access argument," truth and justification both reduce to belief in practice, making 知识 functionally equivalent to "what each individual believes to be correct." This is more radical than post-Gettier externalism or internalism—it dissolves the knowledge/belief distinction entirely at the practical level. The term oscillates between the colloquial sense (what people call knowledge) and the technical sense (JTB), but the author's analysis shows this distinction collapses in epistemic practice. In the K1 categorical framework, knowledge is formalized as a category $(\mathcal{E}_K)_t$ where objects are beliefs and morphisms are justification relations (which are themselves beliefs).

## 认知
- **Main translation**: cognition
- **Alternatives**:
  - "cognitive structure" (when referring to stable patterns)
  - "epistemic framework" (in formal contexts)
- **Note**: Used to denote the overall cognitive-epistemic architecture. Relates to foundationalism through the author's identification of "stable structures" ($S_E$) under categorical evolution—these may include a priori cognitive structures in some interpretations, but the author carefully avoids claiming they are a priori in a transcendental sense. Instead, stable structures are identified *descriptively* through their invariance under evolution, offering a naturalized alternative to Kantian categories. The term bridges psychology (cognitive science) and epistemology (theory of knowledge).

## 信念
- **Main translation**: belief
- **Alternatives**:
  - "doxastic state" (in technical epistemological contexts)
  - "conviction" (when emphasizing strength of commitment)
- **Note**: Central to the author's dissolution of JTB. Defined as "a thought of taking something as true," inherently subjective and "intrinsically irrelevant to objective truth." The author argues that all justification reduces to belief (belief-about-belief), and truth is never directly accessed—only phenomena, which must be "digested" into belief. This makes belief the only epistemically operative category. The Chinese 信念 carries stronger connotations of conviction than the English philosophical sense of "belief," but in the formal K1 framework, objects in $(\mathcal{E}_K)_t$ are beliefs in the weaker technical sense. Translation must preserve that knowledge is ultimately *just* belief in the author's system.

---

## 真理
- **Main translation**: truth
- **Alternatives**:
  - "objective truth" (when distinguishing from subjective belief)
  - "correspondence with reality" (in realist contexts the author critiques)
- **Note**: The author's treatment is deflationary and access-focused. "Truth" in the JTB formula refers to objective truth, but the author argues this is "methodologically impossible" to access—we only access phenomena, never truth directly. The "truth condition is vacuous" in practice. This is distinct from denying truth's existence (the author remains agnostic) but argues truth *does not enter into actual epistemic processes*. This resembles pragmatist deflation (truth as what works) but is more radical: truth is simply *inoperative* in knowledge formation. Not anti-realism (no ontological claim), but methodological phenomenalism applied to epistemology.

---

## 辩护 / 证成
- **Main translation**: justification
- **Alternatives**:
  - "warrant" (in contexts emphasizing epistemic entitlement)
  - "verification relation" (证实关系, when used as morphism in categorical framework)
- **Note**: The author's central thesis is that justification reduces to belief. All justification bases (phenomena, truth, prior justified beliefs) collapse into belief when we ask *how we access them*. Phenomena require "digestion" into thought; truth is accessed only through phenomena; prior justified beliefs are belief-about-belief. This creates Agrippa's trilemma: either circular justification (rejected via reductio involving babies having knowledge) or foundation in unjustified belief (accepted). In the K1 framework, 证实关系 are morphisms in $(\mathcal{E}_K)_t$—the structural relations between beliefs that constitute epistemic architecture. This is neither pure foundationalism (no unjustified justifiers) nor coherentism (no mere coherence suffices), but a dissolution: justification *just is* belief-structure.

---

## 经验
- **Main translation**: experience
- **Alternatives**:
  - "experiential content" (when emphasizing phenomenal character)
  - "empirical data" (in contexts about empirical justification)
- **Note**: The author uses 经验 to bridge phenomena and cognition. In "A Thought on Knowledge," empirical justification is analyzed: to use experience as a justification base, it must be "digested" into belief (the Bob examples). This dissolves the distinction between experience-based and belief-based justification. In the K1 strategy, $\mathbb{E}_t$ (the total experiential category) includes all experience at time $t$, with a stable structure $S_E$ that may partially constitute a priori cognitive structures. Experience is not raw sense-data (rejected empiricism) but always already structured. Relates to reliabilism: even reliable experiential processes must manifest phenomenally to enter justification, neutralizing externalist moves.

---

## 现象
- **Main translation**: phenomenon / phenomena (plural)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "appearance" (emphasizing contrast with reality)
  - "what is given in experience" (phenomenological sense)
- **Note**: The epistemological *starting point*—"what we experience or observe." The author explicitly states: "in practice, we do not have direct access to truth; we have direct access to phenomena." This is the cornerstone of the "access argument." 现象 functions as epistemological bedrock without ontological commitment (not claiming phenomena are "more real"—just methodologically primary). Translated "phenomena" (not "phenomenal experience") to preserve the phenomenological resonance. In the formal framework, $\mathfrak{P}$ denotes the totality of phenomena, which are then structured into 境 ($\mathcal{E}$). All justification bases bottom out in phenomena, which must be converted into belief to function epistemically. This is *practical* phenomenalism: whether or not things exist beyond phenomena, only phenomena can serve as starting points for actual justification.

---

## 感受
- **Main translation**: feeling / felt experience
- **Alternatives**:
  - "qualitative experience" (when emphasizing phenomenal character)
  - "affective state" (when emphasizing emotional dimension)
  - "experiential component" (in formal contexts)
- **Note**: Used interchangeably with "体验" to denote parts of phenomena. The author states: "any part of P" is a feeling or experience. This is closer to "qualia" in philosophy of mind, but without the ontological baggage. In the categorical framework, feelings/experiences are objects in $\mathcal{E}$, and associations (联想) between them are morphisms. Epistemologically significant because feelings are the "material" from which beliefs and knowledge structures are constructed. When the author discusses introspection, feelings are what can be accessed through categorical structure—we can verify the framework by noting whether specific structural positions evoke specific feelings. This provides an empirical check on the formal epistemology.

---

## 境
- **Main translation**: Jing (preserve as transliterated technical term)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "structured experiential field" (when explanation is needed)
  - "categorical sphere over phenomena" (in technical contexts)
  - "realm of experience" (in less formal contexts)
- **Note**: The collection's central concept. Epistemologically, 境 is the *structured organization of phenomena*—the categorical architecture that makes knowledge possible. Defined as a category $\mathcal{E}$ whose objects are selected from phenomena ($\mathfrak{P}$) and whose morphisms are associations (联想, also part of phenomena). Crucially: morphisms are also objects (tower structure), making 境 self-referential. This is the *formal* answer to "how is knowledge structured?" Not the content of knowledge, but the *form* of epistemic organization. Different 境 can be constructed over the same phenomena (language-境, mathematics-境, knowledge-境), each revealing different stable structures. The term is untranslatable because its meaning is constituted by the entire theoretical framework—translation would require explaining the framework anyway, so preserve "Jing" and explicate.

---

## 联想
- **Main translation**: association
- **Alternatives**:
  - "associative connection" (when emphasizing relational character)
  - "conceptual link" (in knowledge contexts)
- **Note**: Morphisms in the categorical structure of 境. Epistemologically: the relations between experiential contents that constitute cognitive/epistemic structure. When "I see a pencil and think of a pen," the association is the morphism linking pencil to pen in $\mathcal{E}$. But association is also an object (a feeling of connection), making the structure tower-like. This formalizes how concepts are related in knowledge structures—not through logical entailment alone, but through experiential associations that can be phenomenologically verified. Associations ground both coherentist webs of belief and foundationalist inference chains (both reduce to associative structure in this framework). Translation must preserve that associations are both structural (morphisms) and experiential (objects).

---

## 构造
- **Main translation**: construction
- **Alternatives**:
  - "structuration" (when emphasizing process)
  - "generative procedure" (in contexts about how higher-order concepts arise)
- **Note**: Refers to the process by which higher-order metaphysical concepts are generated from lower-order elements through categorical tower-building. Epistemologically significant for understanding how abstract concepts are formed from experience. The author distinguishes two directions: bottom-up (abstraction from particular experiences to general concepts) and top-down (applying general concepts to structure particular experiences). Both are "constructions" but with different base points. Relates to genetic epistemology (how knowledge develops) and the distinction between discovery and justification. The author emphasizes: 境 is *not* constructed from phenomena (it's a structure *on* phenomena), but metaphysical concepts *within* 境 are constructed through categorical procedures. Essential for understanding how "knowledge occurs" (知识的发生) in the K1 framework.

---

## 恒常
- **Main translation**: constancy / the constant
- **Alternatives**:
  - "invariance" (in mathematical contexts)
  - "permanence" (emphasizing temporal aspect)
  - "stability" (when referring to stable structures)
- **Note**: The *epistemic demand* for stability that motivates all metaphysics. The author argues: "The core of metaphysics is *constancy*—we need to find (pursue) a kind of constancy in changing phenomena, so that we can meaningfully act." This is the *non-rational* foundation of epistemology: we require constancy (same causes produce same effects, identity over time, reidentifiable objects) to have any epistemic traction on phenomena. Relates to Hume's problem of induction (constancy cannot be rationally justified) but the author *accepts* this non-rational basis rather than trying to solve it. The "stable structures" ($S_K$, $S_E$) in categorical evolution are formal expressions of constancy—what remains invariant as experience evolves. This shifts epistemology from seeking rational foundations to *describing* the constancies we inevitably construct.

## 第一实在
- **Main translation**: first reality / primary reality
- **Alternatives**:
  - "first actuality" (emphasizing metaphysical weight)
  - "primary given" (phenomenological contexts)
  - "epistemological foundation" (when emphasizing foundational role)
- **Note**: Phenomena as the *methodologically* (not ontologically) primary starting point for all knowledge. The author states: "现象 itself is the unquestionable existence... therefore called 'first reality.'" This is *not* a claim that phenomena are "most real" ontologically, but that they are epistemically unavoidable—"we have no choice but to necessarily start from phenomena." Any postulated "zeroth reality" (reality-in-itself generating phenomena) becomes "second reality" (constructed interpretation) the moment we theorize it. This dissolves skeptical problems about external world: not by proving the external world exists, but by recognizing phenomena are our only possible starting point, making skepticism pragmatically inert. The "first" in "first reality" is methodological priority, not ontological rank.

---

## 第二实在
- **Main translation**: second reality
- **Alternatives**:
  - "constructed reality" (emphasizing interpretive aspect)
  - "objective world model" (when referring to physical object interpretation)
- **Note**: Our *interpretive constructions* over phenomena—the "things" we take phenomena to represent. Example: the image of an apple (phenomenon) is interpreted as representing a stable external object, "the apple" (second reality). This is where all metaphysics operates: constructing stable constancies over phenomenal flux. The "objective world" is second reality—constructed to explain first reality (phenomena), though we then *reverse* the explanatory direction and think second reality generates first reality. Epistemologically: all knowledge claims are about second reality (since phenomena are not "claims" but given), but justified only through first reality (phenomena are the only justification base). This explains why knowledge is always interpretively laden yet empirically constrained.

---

## 第〇实在
- **Main translation**: zeroth reality
- **Alternatives**:
  - "reality-in-itself" (Kantian contexts)
  - "noumenal ground" (emphasizing inaccessibility)
- **Note**: A hypothetical "reality behind phenomena" that, the author argues, is epistemologically inoperative. Any attempt to theorize zeroth reality converts it into second reality (interpretation). The author states: "真正的道不可道不可名，无可讨论无法提出" (true Dao cannot be spoken, cannot be named, cannot be discussed or proposed)—any zeroth reality that is discussed is already second reality. This dissolves the correspondence theory of truth: we cannot check our beliefs against reality-in-itself, only against phenomena. Not ontological anti-realism (the author doesn't deny reality-in-itself exists), but *methodological* phenomenalism: reality-in-itself, even if it exists, cannot enter into epistemology. The numbering is deliberate: we start from 1 (phenomena), construct 2 (interpretations), and can never reach 0 (pre-interpretive reality).

---

## 形而上学
- **Main translation**: metaphysics
- **Alternatives**:
  - "meta-physics" (when emphasizing etymological sense of "beyond physics")
  - "theory of ultimate reality" (in traditional contexts the author critiques)
- **Note**: The author distinguishes "metaphysics" (形而上学, the study of metaphysical concepts) from "the metaphysical" (形而上, metaphysical concepts themselves). Traditional metaphysics seeks "ultimate reality" but the author's "post-metaphysics" (后形而上学) recognizes all metaphysics as *constructions over phenomena*, not discoveries of pre-given reality. Epistemologically significant: metaphysical concepts function as universal properties (始对象/终对象) in categorical structures—they are the *stable points* toward which associations converge. For example, the concept "pen" is the terminal object in the sub-category of pen-like objects: all specific pens point to "pen-in-general." This explains how abstract concepts function in knowledge: they are organizational nodes, not Platonic forms. Translation must preserve that the author is *not* rejecting metaphysics but reframing it descriptively.

---

## 虚无
- **Main translation**: nihility / the void
- **Alternatives**:
  - "nihilism" (when referring to the philosophical position)
  - "absence" (when emphasizing privative character)
  - "meaninglessness" (in value contexts)
- **Note**: The consequence of realizing that traditional metaphysics sought a "zeroth reality" that cannot be reached. The author states: "Nihilism is not a something, not an -ism, but a lack, an absence." This is not a position to argue for but a *state* resulting from the collapse of metaphysical foundations when "ultimate reality" is recognized as inaccessible. Epistemologically: nihilism shows that the *goal* of traditional epistemology (knowledge of ultimate reality) is unattainable, but this doesn't make knowledge impossible—it shifts the question from "do we have knowledge?" to "what do we do with beliefs in the absence of foundations?" The author's post-metaphysical approach accepts the void and works within it, making practice (not foundation) primary.

---

## 理性
- **Main translation**: reason / rationality
- **Alternatives**:
  - "rational faculty" (when emphasizing cognitive capacity)
  - "the rational" (as noun, contrasted with non-rational)
- **Note**: The author makes a crucial argument: "the goal of reason must lie outside reason, so the goal of reason is necessarily non-rational—that is, reason exists only as a tool." This has epistemological implications: rational justification cannot justify itself without circularity, so rationality's *value* is non-rationally grounded (in the non-rational demand for constancy, for effective action, for meaning). This resolves the regress problem differently than foundationalism or coherentism: the regress ends in non-rational commitment, which is *accepted* rather than disguised. The pursuit of knowledge is ultimately non-rational (we cannot rationally justify why knowledge matters), but this doesn't vitiate knowledge—it locates knowledge within the broader context of human non-rational aims.

---

## 非理性
- **Main translation**: the non-rational / non-rationality
- **Alternatives**:
  - "arational" (to avoid negative connotations of "irrational")
  - "extra-rational" (emphasizing it's beyond, not against, reason)
- **Note**: NOT "irrational" (against reason) but "non-rational" (outside reason's domain). The author identifies several non-rational foundations of epistemology: (1) the demand for constancy/metaphysics, (2) the need for self-realization through practice, (3) the goals that make knowledge valuable. This is the phenomenological/existential dimension of epistemology that analytic philosophy often brackets. The author states these non-rational elements "should be acknowledged" because they make rational activity possible and meaningful. Importantly: non-rational ≠ unjustifiable; it's unjustifiable *by reason*, but pragmatically justified by its role in making human life possible. This connects to naturalized epistemology: if we study how humans actually form knowledge, we find non-rational elements throughout.

---

## 先验
- **Main translation**: a priori
- **Alternatives**:
  - "transcendental" (in Kantian contexts)
  - "prior to experience" (when emphasizing temporal/logical priority)
- **Note**: The author's treatment is carefully agnostic. Stable structures $S_E$ preserved under evolution *might* include a priori elements if we identify them with the earliest structures $S_{E_c}$ at the first moment of cognitive life, "independent of experience and sense-impressions." But the author emphasizes this is *descriptive*, not transcendental deduction. We identify stable structures empirically (by observing invariance), not by transcendental argument. This naturalizes the a priori: instead of "necessary conditions of possible experience," we get "evolutionarily stable structures in actual experience." Relates to Quine's naturalized epistemology (no first philosophy) but retains something like Kantian structure (cognitive frameworks that organize experience). The translation must preserve the author's agnosticism: these *might* be a priori, but we only access them as stable patterns.

---

## 综合
- **Main translation**: synthesis / synthetic
- **Alternatives**:
  - "integration" (emphasizing unification)
  - "combination" (in contexts about concept formation)
- **Note**: Used in contexts about how elements are combined to form higher-level structures. In epistemology, relates to the synthetic a priori (Kant) and the distinction between analytic and synthetic judgments. The author's framework suggests all knowledge is synthetic (constructed from experiential materials), including what we might call "analytic" truths (these are just highly stable constructions). In the categorical framework, synthesis corresponds to functorial mappings that preserve structure while combining or transforming elements. Not heavily theorized in the texts, but implicit in the tower-construction methodology: higher-order concepts synthesize lower-order ones while preserving associative structure.

---

## 分析
- **Main translation**: analysis / analytic
- **Alternatives**:
  - "decomposition" (when emphasizing breaking down)
  - "conceptual analysis" (in philosophical contexts)
- **Note**: The process of examining concepts by breaking them into components or examining their structure. The author's method is deeply analytic in practice: analyzing JTB into components, analyzing justification bases into access-modes, analyzing metaphysical concepts into categorical structures. But the author likely rejects the analytic/synthetic distinction as traditionally drawn (all judgments are ultimately grounded in synthetic experience). In formal contexts, "analysis" might refer to examining categorical structure—identifying objects, morphisms, universal properties. The "Analysis Report" itself exemplifies philosophical analysis: systematic examination of how epistemological concepts function in the author's framework.

---

## 掌握
- **Main translation**: grasp / to grasp / mastery
- **Alternatives**:
  - "command" (emphasizing full competence)
  - "to have mastered" (emphasizing achievement)
  - "complete understanding" (when specifically about comprehension)
- **Note**: Technical term in the K1 strategy's discussion of natural transformations. To "grasp" a formula $a$ means the natural transformation component $\eta_a$ is the identity morphism—the evolution of the formula's structure aligns perfectly with one's experiential evolution, requiring no mediating confirmation process. The author states: "当 $\eta_a$ 是单位元时... 不需要经过任何额外思考来完成确认" (when $\eta_a$ is the identity... no additional thought is needed for confirmation). This is a *phenomenological* notion of knowledge: you "grasp" something when your experience of thinking through it matches your experience of the result directly, without gap. Relates to Bolzano's "Vorstellung," intuitive understanding, and tacit knowledge—but formalized categorically. Not mere familiarity, but structural alignment.

---

## 理解
- **Main translation**: understanding / to understand
- **Alternatives**:
  - "comprehension" (emphasizing grasping meaning)
  - "intelligibility" (as noun, what makes something understandable)
- **Note**: More general than "掌握." The author states: "当我看到一个东西，并且认为你懂这个东西，这意味着这个东西的结构演化与你自身的经验演化之间确立了一个自然变换" (when you see something and think you understand it, this means a natural transformation is established between the thing's structural evolution and your experiential evolution). Understanding is the *feeling* of $\eta$ (the alignment between structure and experience), even if $\eta$ is not the identity (not full grasp). You can understand something without fully grasping it—there's a gradient. This dissolves the understanding/explanation distinction: understanding IS the experiential alignment, not a separate mental act. Relates to hermeneutics (understanding as fusion of horizons) but formalized categorically: understanding is natural transformation.
