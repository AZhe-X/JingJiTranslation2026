## Overall Assessment: **Good**

The translation preserves the epistemological structure of the argument: absurdity arises from a category error (seeking meaning externally when meaning is internally generated), and dissolution requires not heroic revolt but proper orientation of the meaning-generating capacity.

## Epistemological Strengths

### 1. The Access Argument in Disguise

The essay's core move is epistemological, not existentialist: "Meaning is generated from within a person, not received from outside — there is no meaning in the universe at all."

This is the access argument applied to meaning. Just as we cannot access truth directly (Essay 2), we cannot access meaning externally. The universe doesn't *have* meaning to give; meaning is constructed on phenomena, not extracted from beyond them.

The translation preserves this clearly.

### 2. The Descending Scale as Philosophical Experiment

The sequence — Sisyphus → office worker → entrepreneur → cat owner — is a load-bearing structure. Each step reduces the "transcendent" component until, with the cat, transcendence drops out entirely. The reader doesn't just *understand* that immanent meaning suffices; they *experience* the absurdity of connecting cat-raising to cosmic meaninglessness.

This functions as what the K1 essay calls a "philosophical experiment": constructing conditions to produce a specific experiential insight. The translation preserves the sequence intact.

### 3. Terminology Choices

- **"Dissonance"** for 非和谐: Correct. Captures the structural misalignment (off-tone) between expectation and reality.
- **"Immanent meaning"** for 内生的意义: Excellent. "Immanent" (remaining within, not transcending) is precisely right — meaning that arises without requiring external grounding.
- **"Alienation"** for 异化: Appropriate. The Marxist resonance is intentional — work becomes absurd when separated from the self.

### 4. TN2 — The Cat's Philosophical Function

TN2 correctly identifies the key insight: "Meaning is not recovered or constructed — it simply *is*, immanently, without needing articulation."

This is epistemologically precise. The cat owner doesn't have *better* justification for their activity; they don't *have* justification at all in the propositional sense. They simply engage. The meaning/feeling unity (from the 诗意 essay: "意义和感受即是两面一体") is enacted rather than argued.

## Minor Observations

### 1. "Off-tone" Preservation

The author's English gloss "off-tone" appears in context: "a dissonance arises... — an off-tone, a misalignment." This preserves the author's own musical metaphor nicely.

### 2. Consistency with Later Essays

The term "transcendence" (超越/超越性) here refers to what lies outside the self — the universe, the gods, external sources of meaning. This usage is consistent with the later essays where transcendence becomes a technical term for what exceeds the boundary of one's experiential sphere.

---

## No Changes Recommended

The draft is epistemologically sound. The key argument — that absurdity is a category error resolved by recognizing meaning's immanence — comes through clearly. The philosophical experiment structure (descending scale to the cat) is preserved intact. The TNs add context without over-explaining.
