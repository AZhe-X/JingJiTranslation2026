## Topic: Author's Standpoint on Social Issues

**Revision:** New section added to 零散想法 —「关于社会性议题」

> 在这篇文集中，我们基本没有直接涉及到社会性议题。我们从集体利益开始，到"写到最后"结束。我们只能从自身个人的视角出发并回归自身，但我们已经、正在、且也将继续我们对境的明晰和构建。

**Team consensus (2026-02-20):**

The author takes no normative position on social issues — no prescriptions about which structures to change or how — but the framework does something prior and more powerful: it demystifies social constructions by placing them in the same ontological category as every other 境-construction, dissolving the false sense that cities, nations, and institutions are natural givens rather than human-built structures. Combined with the affirmation that the reader is already a constructor, this implicitly restores the recognition that social reality can be constructed otherwise — without telling anyone what to build. The 关于社会性议题 note is honest about the first part (no direct engagement, no adjudication) but slightly undersells the second: the collection's silence on what to construct is not evasion but method, preserving the reader's agency precisely by not prescribing its content.

**Structural logic:**
1. All social constructions (cities, nations, laws, currencies, education systems) are 境-constructions — not natural givens
2. The reader is already a constructor — this is what humans do
3. (Available inference, not stated): the reader can construct and reconstruct social reality

The author does not state (3) explicitly. The implicature is deliberate: empowering without prescribing.

**Translation note:**
The 写在最后 closing paragraph should feel like *recognition*, not exhortation. The reader is supposed to feel the capacity, not receive instructions. The "stirring" register is the point. Do not flatten it.

## Topic: 分析判断 — Two Analytic Judgment Claims

**Revision:** New section added to 零散想法 identifying two claims in the collection as analytic judgments.

---

### Claim 1: "理性的目的在理性之外"

**Verdict: Analytic (unanimous, rapid consensus)**

**Reasoning:** "Purpose" means directedness toward something not yet reached — a destination. A thing cannot have itself as its destination, because if it were already there, there would be no directedness, no "要抵达." The claim follows from what "purpose" means, regardless of how one defines "reason." The analytic status does not depend on a particular account of rationality.

**Note:** Initial hesitation from Wittgenstein and Kantian advisors (Wittgenstein raised homeostasis as possible counterexample; Kantian called it "substantive"). Both resolved on closer reading: homeostasis tends toward a target equilibrium *different* from current state, so the directional gap is preserved; the denial remains self-undermining regardless of how reason is defined.

### Claim 2: "哲学结构如果在经验中有稳定呈现，就可以进行经验性验证"

**Verdict: Analytic (unanimous, after 4-round debate)**

**Final vote: Y (all 9 advisors)**

**Initial split:** 6 Analytic, 3 Synthetic (Phenomenology, Metaphysics, Buddhism).

**Synthetic side's strongest arguments:**
- Verification requires a standard for what counts as success — standard-setting is synthetic, not contained in "stable presence" (Phenomenology)
- Something maximally stable as a *background condition* of experience resists contrastive testing — yet has "stable presence"; therefore stable presence ≠ verifiable (Buddhism/Kantian)
- If the claim is analytic under the thin reading, K1's whole experimental program is redundant — the claim can only do work under a rich reading, which is synthetic (Chinese Philosophy/Metaphysics)

**Analytic side's decisive moves:**
1. **KA distinction**: KA conjecture [^5] is about whether K1 conditions can mathematically *derive* stable structures — a formal derivability question orthogonal to whether experiential checking is applicable in principle. KA being conjectural does not put pressure on the analytic claim.
2. **Middle reading**: "Empirically verifiable" means the experience-based method is *applicable and appropriate* — not trivially thin ("look again") and not synthetically rich ("confirmed against a pre-specified standard"). This middle reading does non-trivial categorical work (relocates philosophical structures out of the domain of pure-reason speculation) while following analytically from the concepts.
3. **Division of labor**: The analytic claim establishes the domain (experience is the right court of appeal); K1 supplies the method (how to implement verification). These are different levels — K1 being synthetic doesn't make the analytic claim synthetic.
4. **Existentialism's terminal question**: "If the standard for empirical verification is not 'return to experience,' what else could it be?" Every demand for a prior external standard generates a regress anchored only by the experiential domain itself — which the antecedent already specifies analytically.

**Flips:** Chinese Philosophy (Round 2), Metaphysics + Kantian + Buddhism (Round 4), Phenomenology (Round 4 final).

**Key insight from Phenomenology's flip:**
> "My error was conflating the difficulty of satisfying the antecedent with the synthetic status of the conditional. The synthetic question is: *does* this philosophical structure stably present in experience (across subjects)? The analytic claim is: *if* it does, it's verifiable. I kept conflating the difficulty of the 'if' with the status of the 'then.'"

**Translation note:**
The claim is analytic, but readers should understand that confirming philosophical structures actually satisfy the antecedent — that they genuinely and stably present across subjects — is the hard synthetic work K1's experimental program is designed to do. The analytic claim establishes the categorical license; K1 establishes that specific structures satisfy the condition. Do not conflate the two in translation apparatus.
