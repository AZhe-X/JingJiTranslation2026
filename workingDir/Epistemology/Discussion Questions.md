# Discussion Questions — Resolution Notes

## Topic #10: 道德仁義禮 Inversion

**Date:** 2026-02-12

**Question:** Does the author's analysis foreclose or merely bracket ontological claims about 仁's priority?

**Opening:** Chinese Philosophy raised concern that the author's genetic analysis (禮→仁/義→德→道) might reduce 仁 to a projection rather than a genuine moral reality that Confucianism claims.

**Key Tension:** Metaphysics argued that defining metaphysical concepts as universal properties (structural position) might itself be an ontological commitment that forecloses traditions claiming essence isn't exhausted by structure.

**Resolution:** 
- Footnote 25 explicitly states: "此处'第一实在'只是名称，而不是现象是否是本体论上具有实在地位的论断"
- The 范畴论与境 opening offers three interpretations without choosing:
  1. Structure IS essence
  2. Structure REPRESENTS essence  
  3. Both together
- The author explicitly says this is "仅仅是描述性的" (merely descriptive)

**Consensus:** The framework **brackets** rather than forecloses ontological claims. Confucians can accept the epistemological analysis (how we learn concepts through observation) while maintaining ontological claims about 仁's priority. The structure-exhausts-essence question is left explicitly open.

**Vote:** 9/0 (Yes, resolved)

**Implication for Translation:** The 道德仁義禮 passage describes *order of knowing*, not *order of being*. Translation notes should clarify this distinction for readers from traditions with ontological commitments about moral concepts.

## Topic #3: η as Understanding — Criterion or Redescription?

**Date:** 2026-02-12

**Question:** Does structural alignment (η) provide a genuine *criterion* for understanding, or merely redescribe what we already do when we claim to understand?

**Opening (Wittgenstein):** η provides genuine criterion, not mere redescription, for two reasons:
1. The naturality condition is a *structural constraint*, not a subjective feeling — private content drops out, structural role remains (beetle-in-the-box move)
2. The criterion is *verified by practice* — whether subsequent operations succeed

**Key Contributions:**
- **Buddhism:** Dharmakīrti's *arthakriyā* defines valid cognition as what enables successful practice — there's no deeper criterion to seek
- **Kantian:** Practice as tribunal is *grounding* not regress; the naturality condition provides what Kant's schematism attempted
- **Existentialism:** Failure is self-announcing (project breaks down, tool becomes conspicuous) — no further criterion needed
- **Philosophy of Mind:** Alignment IS the understanding; practice tests whether alignment was genuine
- **Epistemology:** External constraints provide error-detection without regress

**Resolution:** 
- η provides **genuine criterion** (not mere redescription)
- The "relocation to practice" is **termination** not regress
- External constraints (game rules, math structure, physical phenomena) and self-announcing failure provide error-detection
- Multiple traditions converge: arthakriyā (Buddhism), Erfüllung (Phenomenology), schematism (Kant), breakdown (Existentialism)

**Vote:** Unanimous Yes (clarified)

**Implication for Translation:** η passages should be translated to convey that structural alignment is a *testable criterion* verified by practical success, not merely a description of subjective feeling.
