# Discussion Questions — Resolution Notes

## Topic #10: 道德仁義禮 Inversion

**Date:** 2026-02-12

**Question:** Does the author's analysis foreclose or merely bracket ontological claims about 仁's priority?

**Opening:** Chinese Philosophy raised concern that the author's genetic analysis (禮→仁/義→德→道) might reduce 仁 to a projection rather than a genuine moral reality that Confucianism claims.

**Key Tension:** Metaphysics argued that defining metaphysical concepts as universal properties (structural position) might itself be an ontological commitment that forecloses traditions claiming essence isn't exhausted by structure.

**Resolution:** 
- Footnote 25 explicitly states: "此处'第一实在'只是名称，而不是现象是否是本体论上具有实在地位的论断"
- The 范畴论与境 opening offers three interpretations without choosing:
  1. Structure IS essence
  2. Structure REPRESENTS essence  
  3. Both together
- The author explicitly says this is "仅仅是描述性的" (merely descriptive)

**Consensus:** The framework **brackets** rather than forecloses ontological claims. Confucians can accept the epistemological analysis (how we learn concepts through observation) while maintaining ontological claims about 仁's priority. The structure-exhausts-essence question is left explicitly open.

**Vote:** 9/0 (Yes, resolved)

**Implication for Translation:** The 道德仁義禮 passage describes *order of knowing*, not *order of being*. Translation notes should clarify this distinction for readers from traditions with ontological commitments about moral concepts.
