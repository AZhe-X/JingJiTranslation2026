## Overall Rating: **Good**

The minimal apparatus is appropriate. This essay was composed in English by the author — our job is NOT to edit the author's prose, but to integrate it into the collection with just enough connective tissue.

## What Was Added (Review)

### 1. Translator's Note
The TN is well-crafted:
- Explains the essay's origin (author's English)
- Connects "phenomena" to the collection's technical 现象
- Signals the essay's role ("laying the epistemological groundwork")
- Does NOT over-explain or impose interpretation

**Verdict:** Appropriate. Neither too much nor too little.

### 2. YAML Frontmatter
Standardized for collection consistency. Includes clear note that this is author's original English. Good.

### 3. Preservation of Original
- Author's prose: **verbatim** ✓
- Footnote (original publication link): **preserved** ✓
- Sidenotes (philosophically substantive): **all preserved** ✓
- Acknowledgement to Claude: **preserved** ✓
- Structure (main text → sidenotes → footnote): **intact** ✓

## Critical Editorial Principle: B6

Per AGENTS.md:
> **B6 (7.6/10): NEVER harmonize native English with translated essays.**

This essay must NOT be smoothed, polished, or made to match the register of the translated essays. The author's own English voice — slightly informal, exploratory, with occasional non-native constructions — is the authentic text. Any "corrections" would violate editorial boundaries.

**Confirmed:** No harmonization has occurred. The text is verbatim.

---

## Key Passages Preserved

### Three Bob Examples
The experimental payload of the essay. Bob 3 (emotional reverie, no belief formed despite perceiving rain) is intact. This is the phenomenological core.

### "Knowledge is just... belief?"
The rhetorical deflation lands. The ellipsis and question mark do the work.

### Sidenotes
All philosophically substantive sidenotes preserved:
- Justification bases list
- Access argument
- Knowledge in motion (physics example)
- Access to truth (mathematics example)
- Circular justification reductio
- Agrippa's Trilemma mention

---

## No Flags Raised

The apparatus is minimal and appropriate. The author's original English is preserved without harmonization.

---

## Recommendation

**Approve as-is.** No changes required.
