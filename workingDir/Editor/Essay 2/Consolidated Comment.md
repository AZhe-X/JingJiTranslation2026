## Summary of Consensus

### 1. Translator's Note — Appropriately Minimal
All advisors confirm the TN is well-crafted:
- Correctly identifies essay as author's original English
- Connects "phenomena" to Chinese 现象
- Provides accurate gloss: "what we experience or observe, the indubitable ground of all cognition"
- Forward-references "First Reality" appropriately (the "elsewhere called" phrasing handles this gracefully)
- Signals the essay's role as "epistemological groundwork" without over-claiming
- Does NOT over-explain — respects the author's original English

### 2. Preservation Approach — Correct
The decision to preserve the author's English verbatim is unanimously supported. Per B6 (harmonization boundary), this essay must not be edited to match the translated essays.

### 3. Key Content — Intact
All advisors confirm the philosophical payload is preserved:
- **Access argument** (sidenotes)
- **Three Bob examples** (phenomenological experiment)
- **"Digestion" concept** (phenomena → belief conversion)
- **Deflationary conclusion** ("knowledge is just... belief?")
- **Author's sidenotes** (philosophically substantive)
- **Claude acknowledgement** (preserved transparently)

## Minor Observation (No Change Required)

**From Metaphysics:**
> The TN mentions "First Reality" — readers encountering this essay first won't have met that term yet.

**Advisor's verdict:** Leave as-is (option A). The parenthetical "elsewhere called" signals it's a forward-reference, and readers can read non-linearly.

**Editor concurs.** No change needed.

## Cross-Tradition Resonances Identified

| Domain | Resonance |
|--------|-----------|
| **Buddhism** | Parallels pramāṇa theory (Dignāga/Dharmakīrti); "digestion" ≈ pratyakṣa→anumāna transition |
| **Phenomenology** | Echoes Husserl's Principle of All Principles (originary givenness) |
| **Kantian** | More radical than Kant's critical limitation (collapses truth condition entirely) |
| **Wittgenstein** | Echoes *On Certainty*; access constraint is Wittgensteinian in spirit |
| **Philosophy of Mind** | "Digestion" anticipates η-theory in K1策略 |
| **Existentialism** | Practical/lived focus; individual as locus of epistemology |
| **Chinese Philosophy** | Structural parallel to 格物致知 (investigating things to extend knowledge) |
| **Epistemology** | "Access argument" becomes the methodological foundation for First Reality |
| **Metaphysics** | Non-substantivalist — truth is inaccessible, not denied |

## Flags Raised

**None.**

---

## Recommendation

**Approve as-is.** The minimal apparatus is correct. The author's original English is preserved verbatim, and the single TN provides exactly the connective tissue needed to situate the essay within the collection.
