## Overall Rating: **Good**

The translation preserves the essay's exploratory/diary register and handles the physics-derived terminology well. The renormalization metaphor — load-bearing for the entire argument — is rendered clearly with an excellent translator's note. No experiential flatness detected.

## Strengths

### 1. Register Preservation
The thinking-aloud tone comes through from the opening ("Today I have some thoughts on collective interest") through the hedges ("appears to be yes," "I hope to think more clearly about this point in the future"). This IS the author's voice — tentative, exploratory, working through a puzzle in real time.

### 2. Technical Terminology
- **重整化 → "renormalization"** — correct physics term, properly explained in TN
- **有效存在 → "effective existence"** — physics sense preserved; TN clarifies "not merely apparent but genuinely operative"
- **良定义 → "well-defined"** — mathematical register maintained
- **现象 → "phenomena"** — consistent throughout

### 3. Translator's Note Quality
The TN on renormalization is exemplary — explains the physics metaphor without condescension, situates it in quantum field theory, and clarifies why "effective" matters philosophically. This is exactly the right level of apparatus.

### 4. Key Philosophical Moves Preserved
- The micro/macro scale shift argument comes through clearly
- The ocean/wave emergence example lands
- The crucial empathy paragraph — "precisely *because* we are individuals, empathy becomes possible" — preserves the paradox
- The footnote about standing upon oneself to define transcendence is intact

## Minor Observations (not flags)

### 1. Sentence Length
Some sentences run long, but this reflects the original's exploratory rhythm. The prose builds cumulatively. I would NOT recommend breaking them up — the meandering quality is part of the thinking-aloud register.

### 2. Rhetorical Question Format
The "[!FAQ]" callout becomes a blockquote question. Adequate rendering — the Obsidian-specific formatting cannot transfer, and the question still stands out visually.

### 3. Date Preservation
Original date preserved at end — good choice. This anchors the essay as a dated reflection, not a timeless treatise.

## No Flags Raised

This draft requires no editorial flags. The translation is accurate, the register is preserved, and the prose reads well for Western readers while maintaining the original's exploratory character.

## Recommendation

**Approve for next stage.** No content changes required.
