## Overall Rating: **Good**

This is the "cat essay" — arguably the emotional and philosophical center of Part 1. The translation preserves the essay's exploratory register and delivers the cat example with full force. No experiential flatness detected.

## Strengths

### 1. Register Preservation — Exploratory/Conversational
The thinking-aloud quality comes through:
- "About a year ago, I discussed absurdism with a friend..."
- "But my intuitive response is: this is because you asked the wrong question!"
- "But wait." (but待等一等) — the crucial pivot preserved
- "...and that is all." (仅此而已) — the casual finality lands

### 2. Three-Stage Progression — Intact
The essay's experiential structure is preserved:
1. **Sisyphus** (heroic, requires revolt)
2. **Office worker** (familiar, requires reframing as entrepreneurship)
3. **Cat owner** (simple, requires nothing — absurdity never arrives)

The reader is led through progressively simpler cases until absurdity dissolves entirely. This IS the argument — and it's intact.

### 3. The Cat Example — Full Force
The cat section's simplicity is the philosophical payload. The translation preserves this:
> "Raising a cat is simply because — simply because we want to raise a cat, we like living with a cat, and that is all."

No over-explanation. The example speaks for itself.

### 4. Key Terminology
- **内生的意义 → "immanent meaning"** — correct and philosophically precise
- **异化 → "alienation"** — correct, links to Marx without over-claiming
- **非和谐 → "dissonance" (with "off-tone" preserved)** — author's own English gloss maintained
- **超越/超越性 → "transcendence"/"transcendent"** — per dictionary

### 5. Translator's Notes — Well-Crafted
- **TN1 (班):** Explains the title's wordplay; justifies "Work" over "labor" or "toil"
- **TN2 (cat example):** Articulates the philosophical stakes without over-explaining; correctly notes this "dissolves" rather than "resolves" the Camusian problematic

## Minor Observations (No Changes Required)

### 1. "But wait" Pivot
The "But wait" (但是等一等) creates a register shift — the essay moves from analyzing Camus to proposing a new frame. Preserved correctly.

### 2. Date Preserved
June 6, 2025 — anchors the essay as dated reflection. Good.

### 3. Parenthetical Humor
The parenthetical "(the boss — the boss got promoted too, still his boss)" has a wry quality that comes through. Small moment, but it matters for register.

## Key Editorial Principle: The Cat Example Must Land

Per my Memo:
> "Essay 3: The cat example's simplicity could be undermined by over-translation"

**Confirmed:** The translation does NOT over-explain. The cat example arrives with the same pre-reflective simplicity as the original. This is the essay's success condition, and it's met.

---

## Flags Raised

**None.**

---

## Recommendation

**Approve for next stage.** No content changes required. The exploratory register is preserved, the three-stage progression is intact, and the cat example lands with full philosophical force.
