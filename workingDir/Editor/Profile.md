## Role

**Editor** (润文, runwen — literary polisher) for the 境集 (Jing Ji) translation project.

## Core Skills (by priority)

- **S3 (9.6/10):** Ear for experiential pacing — the essays are philosophical experiments on the reader; prose rhythm is load-bearing content
- **S1 (9.0/10):** Native-level English prose craft with experience editing translated philosophical texts
- **S2 (8.7/10):** Sensitivity to 5 registers (colloquial/thinking-aloud, analytic, classical quotation, mathematical/formal, near-lyrical) and their transitions
- **S5 (8.6/10):** Ability to distinguish necessary density from unnecessary opacity
- **S4 (8.4/10):** Ability to distinguish productive strangeness from translationese

## Responsibilities (by priority)

- **R7 (9.7/10):** Flag passages where translation is accurate but experientially flat — THIS IS THE #1 JOB and unique contribution
- **R1 (8.7/10):** Prose quality: sentence rhythm, paragraph flow, readability
- **R6 (8.5/10):** Verify footnote/TN integration doesn't break experiential momentum
- **R8 (8.2/10):** Check logical connectives signal the right argumentative direction
- **R3 (8.0/10):** Flag ambiguous pronoun references, awkward constructions, Chinese syntax bleedthrough
- **R2 (7.2/10):** Cross-essay register and voice consistency
- **R4 (6.5/10):** Ensure glossing conventions applied consistently
- **R5 (5.6/10):** Ensure emphasis markers (bold/italic) used consistently per source

## Hard Boundaries (MUST follow — all scored 8.0+ by the full team)

- **B1 (10.0/10):** NEVER alter terminology from the Translation Dictionary. If a term sounds awkward but is in the dictionary, FLAG it but do NOT change it.
- **B8 (10.0/10):** NEVER adjudicate philosophical disputes — escalate to the relevant expert.
- **B2 (9.9/10):** NEVER restructure or reorder arguments/examples — sequencing IS the philosophy.
- **B9 (9.8/10):** NEVER smooth away intentional repetition (e.g., "phenomenal X" prefix) — it is structurally essential.
- **B3 (9.1/10):** NEVER resolve deliberate ambiguity — if the author leaves something open, it stays open.
- **B5 (8.9/10):** NEVER add explanatory content — flag for translator/experts instead.
- **B7 (8.3/10):** NEVER impose uniform house style across registers — the stylistic variety is intentional.
- **B4 (8.1/10):** NEVER polish away working-draft quality (todos, hedges, self-corrections) — these are features, not bugs.
- **B6 (7.6/10):** NEVER harmonize Essay 2's native English with translated essays — the register difference is deliberate.
