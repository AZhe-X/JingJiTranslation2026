# Essay 2 Draft Review — Metaphysics Advisor

**Draft:** `A Thought on Knowledge.md` (DRAFT-R1)
**Status:** Author's Original English — Minimal Apparatus Added
**Reviewer:** Metaphysics Advisor
**Date:** 2026-02-13

## Overall Assessment: GOOD

The minimal-apparatus approach is exactly right for this essay. The author wrote it in English; preserving the original text verbatim respects authorial voice while the single TN provides the necessary bridge to the collection's vocabulary.

## On the Translator's Note

The TN correctly:
1. Identifies "phenomena" as corresponding to 现象
2. Glosses it as "what we experience or observe, the indubitable ground of all cognition"
3. Connects it to "First Reality" from the other essays
4. Positions this essay as "laying the epistemological groundwork"

This is precisely the right level of intervention — enough to orient readers within the collection's framework without over-explaining or importing apparatus the author didn't use.

## Philosophical Observations

The essay performs the "access argument" that the later essays formalize:
- Truth is methodologically inaccessible
- Justification reduces to belief (through the "digestion" step)
- Knowledge collapses to "what each individual believes to be correct"

The author's own sidenote on "phenomena" ("what we experience or observe") matches the TN's gloss — good internal consistency.

## One Minor Suggestion

The TN mentions "First Reality" — readers encountering this essay before Essay 5 (後形而上學) won't have met that term yet. Consider whether to:
- (A) Leave as-is (readers can read non-linearly; the parenthetical "elsewhere called" signals it's forward-reference)
- (B) Remove the First Reality reference, keeping only "the indubitable ground of all cognition"

I lean toward (A) — the collection is explicitly ordered, and the TN's phrasing ("elsewhere called") handles the forward-reference gracefully.

## No Substantive Changes Needed

The minimal apparatus is appropriate. The author's English is clear, the argument is intact, and the TN bridges to the collection without distorting.

---

**Verdict:** Ready to proceed. No changes requested from Metaphysics.
