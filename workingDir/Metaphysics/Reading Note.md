# Reading Notes — Metaphysics Advisor

## Essay 1: 关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一

### Core Argument
The essay asks whether "collective interest" genuinely exists or reduces to individual interests. Initial intuition: collective interest is just aggregated individual interest — nothing more. But the author reframes this using **renormalization** (重整化) from physics.

### Key Metaphysical Moves

1. **Micro/Macro Distinction**: Individual interests are micro-level; collective interests are macro-level. The question becomes: can macro-level phenomena be well-defined relative to micro-level constituents?

2. **Effective Existence (有效存在)**: The author introduces this concept — macro phenomena are "effectively existing" in the way low-energy effective theories emerge from high-energy physics via renormalization. This is a genuinely interesting ontological move.

3. **The Ocean Analogy**: Water molecules have their motion patterns; ocean waves have different patterns that *emerge* from molecular motion. The wave patterns are "objectively" real (like mathematics). Collective interest is analogously real.

4. **Epistemological Constraint**: Human individuals can only cognize from their own standpoint — they cannot literally occupy the perspective of a collective. But this doesn't undermine the ontological reality of the collective; it's an epistemological limitation.

5. **Empathy's Possibility**: Precisely *because* we are individuals, we can understand other individuals. A collective (as whole) would relate to individuals the way we relate to our cells — with "distance."

6. **Laws as Trans-individual**: Legal systems operate on individuals but affect macro-level dynamics. They're like temperature affecting water — a variable that makes sense at the macro level.

7. **Abstraction = Renormalization?**: The author suggests abstraction itself may be renormalization. Abstract concepts are not free-floating or merely nominal — they're emergent phenomena at different scales.

8. **Continuity of Scales**: Renormalization is continuous — atom → DNA → cell → hair. Similarly: family → community → people → humanity. New phenomena emerge at each scale.

### Metaphysical Assessment

The essay uses physics vocabulary (renormalization, effective theories) but the underlying metaphysical claim is about **emergence** and **ontological levels**. The position seems to be:
- Macro-level entities are real (not mere fictions or useful shorthand)
- Their reality is *dependent on* but *not reducible to* micro-constituents
- This is a form of **non-reductive emergentism**

The move from "effectively existing" to genuine ontological commitment needs careful handling. In physics, effective theories are often understood instrumentally — they work at certain scales but aren't "fundamental." The author seems to want more: that emergent phenomena are genuinely real, not just useful approximations.

The footnotes are interesting: (1) "Only standing on oneself can 'transcending oneself' be defined" — suggests transcendence requires immanence as ground. (2) All considerations ultimately return to the individual — even altruistic aims are "my aims."

## Essay 2: A Thought on Knowledge

### Core Argument
The author is puzzled not by epistemological debates themselves, but by *why we approach knowledge the way we do*. Starting from the classical definition (justified true belief), the author traces what actually happens when humans form and justify knowledge — and finds each component problematic in practice.

### Key Moves

1. **Belief as Subjective**: Belief is "taking something as true" — intrinsically subjective, intrinsically disconnected from "objective truth." The connection to truth (if any) is *extrinsic*.

2. **Access to Truth vs. Access to Phenomena**: In practice, we don't verify beliefs against truth directly. We verify them against *phenomena*. To check "it's raining," we look outside — but we only get the phenomenon of apparent rain (could be a sprinkler). Knowledge relates to phenomena, which *might* imply something about truth.

3. **Justification's Starting Points**: Justification requires starting points that don't themselves require justification *in that context*. Three possibilities:
   - Phenomena (given in experience)
   - Justified beliefs (already justified elsewhere)
   - Truth (if directly accessible)

4. **Phenomena Require Digestion**: To use phenomena in justification, we must convert them into thoughts — "digestion." Therefore, justification from phenomena is really justification from (digested) belief.

5. **The Regress Problem**: If all knowledge requires justified belief, and justified beliefs require further justification, we face:
   - Circular justification (which most reject)
   - Unjustified foundational beliefs (but these can't ground "knowledge")
   - Infinite regress (impossible in finite life)

6. **Practical Conclusion**: In practice, what exists is "what each individual believes to be correct." This can extend to "what most people in a field believe" — and this is sufficient for practical purposes.

### Metaphysical Assessment

The essay is primarily epistemological, but it has metaphysical implications:

**On Truth**: The author sidesteps debates about truth's definition and existence, but the methodological move is significant: truth (if it exists) is *inaccessible directly*. Our relation to it is always mediated by phenomena. This is compatible with various metaphysical positions (phenomenalism, indirect realism, Kantian phenomena/noumena) but resists naive realism.

**On Phenomena**: The author uses "phenomena" to mean what we experience/observe. This is close to the phenomenological sense (what appears to consciousness) rather than the Kantian sense (appearances as opposed to things-in-themselves). The essay doesn't commit to a position on whether phenomena reveal or conceal reality.

**On the Ontological Status of Knowledge**: The essay suggests knowledge (in practice) is a species of belief — socially validated, individually held, historically mutable. This deflates any robust ontological status for "knowledge" as distinct from "belief that functions well."

**Connection to Essay 1**: Both essays share a methodological commitment to asking what actually happens in practice rather than what the concepts theoretically require. Essay 1 asked what collective interest *actually is* (emergent macro-level phenomenon); Essay 2 asks what knowledge *actually is* (validated belief).

### Notable Details
- The sidenotes on physics (particle detection, model selection) and mathematics (proof as belief-based) are illuminating
- The discussion of "standards" — beliefs about which beliefs are better — is a meta-level insight
- The reductio on circular justification (babies with innate knowledge, before-life, etc.) is playfully rigorous

## Essay 3: 西西弗斯、班与猫 (Sisyphus, Ban, and the Cat)

### Core Argument
The essay engages Camus's absurdism: the "off-tone" (非和谐) that arises when humans seek meaning externally and the universe doesn't answer. The author's response: *you're asking the wrong question*. Meaning is internally generated, not externally found. Looking for meaning in the universe is like searching for your watch in places you've never been — of course it feels absurd.

### Key Moves

1. **Absurdity as Misdirection**: The absurd arises from seeking externally what can only be found internally. It's a category mistake.

2. **The Office Worker Example**: A graduate works, advances, but eventually asks "what's the point?" The work's meaning has been *externalized* (contributing to society, getting rich). When meaning is external, there's a gap between self and purpose — alienation. This gap is where absurdity lives.

3. **The Entrepreneur Contrast**: Same work, maybe worse conditions, but no absurdity — because the meaning is *internal* (doing what one wants). No gap, no off-tone.

4. **Sisyphus Revisited**: Sisyphus's "rebellion against absurdity" is itself internal meaning-generation. He regenerates an internal purpose (defiance) even though it's directed at the external (gods, cosmos). The gesture is inward even when aimed outward.

5. **The Cat Example**: Caring for a cat is repetitive, demanding, materially unrewarding — structurally identical to pushing a stone. Yet no one feels absurd caring for a cat. Why? Because the meaning is *endogenous* — internal to the activity itself. We don't even need to articulate it; satisfaction arises naturally from the practice.

6. **No Transcendence Needed**: The cat example doesn't require transcendent meaning (internal rebellion against cosmos) or external validation. Just: "we want to, we like it, that's all" (仅此而已).

### Metaphysical Assessment

**The Ontology of Meaning**: The essay implies meaning has no *external* ontological status — it's not "out there" in the cosmos waiting to be discovered. Meaning is generated subjectively, from within. This is compatible with existentialist themes but pushed further: even Camus's dramatic confrontation with absurdity is unnecessary if you stop looking outside.

**Internalism about Purpose**: The distinction between internal and external purpose is crucial. When purpose is external, it can be lost, questioned, or rendered absurd by comparison with cosmic indifference. When purpose is internal — *constitutive of the activity itself* — no such gap opens.

**Against "Transcendence"**: The essay uses 超越 (transcendence) critically. The office worker's goals are "transcendent" in the sense of external, other-directed. The cat-carer's satisfaction is *immanent* — within the practice, not beyond it.

**Connection to Earlier Essays**:
- Essay 1: Individual interests ultimately return to the individual (footnote 2). Purpose-seeking also returns to the individual.
- Essay 2: Knowledge is really "what I believe is correct" — practically internal. Meaning is "what matters to me" — also internal.

**Phenomenological Resonance**: The cat example anticipates Heidegger's analysis of *Zeug* (equipment) and absorbed coping. When engaged in caring-for, we don't step back and ask for justification. The practice is its own "meaning" without thematization.

## Essay 4: 后形而上学 整理 (Post-Metaphysics)

### Overview
This is the central theoretical essay — directly addressing metaphysics itself. The author develops a framework distinguishing "pre-metaphysics" (traditional metaphysics, before nihilism) from "post-metaphysics" (after nihilism, taking phenomena as foundational).

### Core Framework

**1. 前形而上学 (Pre-Metaphysics / Traditional Metaphysics)**

Definition: The "rules" or "patterns" we infer from phenomena. But there's a crucial formal error in how we understand "metaphysics":

- **The Formal Error**: "Metaphysics" (形而上学, meta-physics) is often read as if the "meta" generates the physical — as if there's something *above* form that produces form. But actually, metaphysics is **generated from** phenomena. The "上" (above) means "based upon phenomena," not "generating phenomena from above."

- **First Reality (第一实在)**: Phenomena — what we directly have. Not "generated" but our starting point. We can only make metaphysical inferences *based on* phenomena.

**2. The Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li Example**

The author traces how Daoist categories actually work vs. how we understand them:

*How they actually arise (bottom-up):*
- 现象礼 (phenomenal ritual) → we observe behavior
- 现象义 (phenomenal motivation) → we infer from our own experience of motivation
- 现象仁 (phenomenal benevolence) → we infer the feeling behind motivation
- 德 (virtue/nature) → we abstract: "all humans have 仁"
- 道 (the Way) → we abstract the universal pattern

*How we understand them (top-down):*
- 道 generates 德
- 德 manifests as 仁
- 仁 produces 义
- 义 is enacted as 礼

**The logic is inverted.** What was generated from phenomena is understood as generating phenomena. The original connection to lived experience gets "lost" (失) at each step.

**3. Types of Metaphysics (形而上)**

- **Type 0 (经验的总结)**: Summary of experience
  - Core: **恒常 (constancy)** — we need permanence to act meaningfully
  - The same apple persisting through visual changes = constancy
  - The concept "apple" abstracted from many apples = constancy
  - Generates "Second Reality" (第二实在) — our constructs

- **Type 1 (经验的预测)**: Prediction from experience
  - What happens repeatedly will continue to happen
  - Based on Type 0 constancy

- **Type 2 (经验的抽象)**: Abstraction from experience
  - Inducting Type 1 patterns into concepts (e.g., "honesty")
  - Two-step process: recognize repetition → fix into concept

- **Type 3 (抽象的组合)**: Combination of abstractions
  - Connects different metaphysical constructs
  - Produces frameworks, values, formalized systems

**4. The Objective World (客观世界)**

The "objective world" is a **model** based on phenomena. It's Second Reality — our interpretation of First Reality. Formally, it seems like the objective world generates phenomena, but actually phenomena generate our conception of the objective world.

We must start from phenomena — there's no standing point otherwise. When we posit a "Zeroth Reality" (what truly generates phenomena), the moment we articulate it, it becomes Second Reality. **真正的道不可道不可名** — the true Dao cannot be spoken or named.

**5. Nihilism and Non-Rationality**

- Nihilism is the "ruin" of metaphysics when the "ultimate reality" collapses
- But: **the pursuit of ultimate reality is itself non-rational**
- The goal of rationality must be outside rationality (analytic point about "goals")
- We need metaphysics (constancy) to act meaningfully — this need is non-rational
- This non-rationality should be **acknowledged** (承认)

**6. 后形而上学 (Post-Metaphysics)**

After nihilism. Its characteristics:
- Takes phenomena as core
- Recognizes all metaphysics as construction *on* phenomena
- Disenchants (祛魅) concepts like "value," "meaning," "essence" — their special status came from non-rational pursuit
- Phenomena now occupy the special position
- **Function**: overlap of ideal and phenomenon = **practice (实践)** = self-realization

Post-metaphysics is itself Type 3 metaphysics (formalized framework). It acknowledges:
1. The existence of non-rationality
2. The effects of non-rationality (like our pursuit of constancy)
3. Its own functional role: enabling practice

### Metaphysical Assessment

This essay is remarkable for a "high school period" reflection. Key points:

**On First/Second Reality**: The distinction between 第一实在 (phenomena) and 第二实在 (constructs) echoes phenomenological and Kantian themes but with its own character. The author avoids committing to whether phenomena "really" are first — just that for us, practically, they function that way.

**On the Inversion**: The claim that metaphysical categories are generated from experience but understood as generating experience is a powerful diagnosis. It resonates with Nietzsche's genealogical method and Heidegger's "forgetting of Being" — the history of metaphysics as progressive concealment of its own origins.

**On Non-Rationality**: The author doesn't reject non-rationality — they acknowledge it as the ground of meaningful action. This is sophisticated: neither rationalist (trying to ground everything in reason) nor irrationalist (rejecting reason). The non-rational is the *condition* of rational activity.

**On Post-Metaphysics**: The move is not to abandon metaphysics but to practice it *self-consciously* — knowing it's construction, knowing the non-rational grounds, focusing on the overlap of ideal and phenomenon (practice).

**Tensions to Note**:
- Is "phenomena" itself a metaphysical concept? The author seems aware of this (noting we can't step below phenomena).
- The role of 恒常 (constancy) — is this a discovered feature of experience or an imposed structure?
- The relationship between this and Heidegger's "overcoming of metaphysics" — is this overcoming or transformation?

## Essay 5: 形而上学后的目的：诗意 (The Purpose After Metaphysics: Poetic Dwelling)

### Core Question
Post-metaphysics (Essay 4) didn't address purpose and meaning — because we know they're not "essentially real" but non-rational. Yet meaning isn't nothing; we live in it daily. So: **what is meaning, and how should we relate to it?**

### Key Concepts

**1. 梦境 (Dreamscape)**

A poetic term for the "environment" in which meaning arises. Examples: games, books, adventures, "little worlds." The term is deliberately suggestive rather than rigidly defined.

**The RPG Example**: Playing a game, we get experiences — gameplay, narrative, philosophical insight. These experiences ARE the purpose:
- For the designer: creating conditions for specific experiences
- For the player: having "my experience" (whether intended or not)

**2. Meaning as Affective**

Bold claim: *meaning and purpose are not rational insight but affective movement* — "the crystallization of experience, the turbulence of emotion." **Meaning and feeling are two sides of one thing** (两面一体).

The dreamscape is:
- The "packaging" of experience
- The environment where purpose can exist

Any feeling has an "environment" that brings it about — that environment is the dreamscape.

**3. Two Modes of Dreamscape**

*沉醉的梦境 (Intoxicated Dreamscape)* = faith, belief
- We don't know we're in a dream
- Purpose becomes logically groundless but historically grounded
- Becomes the logical origin — ultimate reality, first mover, unmoved mover

*清醒的梦境 (Lucid Dreamscape)* = **诗意** (poetic)
- We know we're in a dreamscape
- We know meaning arises *within* this environment
- Like playing a game while knowing it's a game; reading a novel while knowing it's fiction; burning incense while knowing it's symbolic

**Crucial point**: Lucidity doesn't mean detachment. Lucid dreaming still requires full engagement — otherwise you don't get the experience. You can know the game is a game and still be fully immersed.

**4. The Impossibility of Total Abandonment**

Some dreamscapes are unchosen (already there); some are chosen and sustained. You might want to abandon ALL dreamscapes — why invest? why care? But **this is impossible**:
- As already-existing beings, we necessarily have feelings
- Feelings exist *prior to* the concept of "I"
- Feeling and meaning are two-in-one
- The dreamscape is just a description of what already exists
- Abandoning all dreamscapes = abandoning all feeling = only possible when nothing remains

**5. The Poetic Stance**

After metaphysics, the proper relation to meaning is **poetic** (诗意):
- We cannot deny meaning (that would be 虚妄 — empty and arrogant)
- We cannot be intoxicated (Zeroth Reality has been disenchanted)
- What remains: **treat meaning as what it is** — lucid, awake, knowing

This is 清醒的梦境: lucid dreamscape = poetic dwelling.

### Metaphysical Assessment

**On Meaning's Ontological Status**: Meaning isn't "out there" (no ultimate reality) but isn't "nothing" either. It's affective, experiential, bound to the embodied subject. This is neither subjectivist (meaning as arbitrary projection) nor objectivist (meaning as discovered fact). Meaning *arises* in the encounter between feeling beings and their environments.

**The Two-in-One Structure**: 感受 (feeling) and 意义 (meaning) as two aspects of one thing is a strong claim. It suggests we shouldn't ask "what does this mean?" separate from "how does this feel?" — they're the same question from different angles.

**On Faith vs. Poetry**: The distinction between intoxicated and lucid dreamscapes is ethically charged. Faith (沉醉) involves not-knowing you're dreaming; poetry (诗意) involves knowing. But both require full engagement. The difference is reflexive awareness, not degree of investment.

**Resonances**:
- Heidegger's "poetically man dwells" (dichterisch wohnet der Mensch)
- Nietzsche's "truth is a mobile army of metaphors" — knowing it's metaphor while living in it
- Buddhist "conventional truth" — using conceptual frameworks while knowing their emptiness
- The cat example from Essay 3: caring for a cat is a lucid dreamscape — no transcendent justification needed, just full engagement with endogenous meaning

**The Impossibility Argument**: You can't step outside all dreamscapes because you are already a feeling being. This is not a logical impossibility but an existential one — to have no dreamscape would be to have no feeling, which would be not-to-be.

## Essay 6: 范畴论与境 整理 (Category Theory and 境)

### Overview
This is the most technically ambitious essay — using category theory to formalize the structure of thought/experience (境). The essay develops a mathematical framework for understanding how concepts relate, how metaphysical abstractions arise, and what it means to have a "metaphysics."

### Why Category Theory?

The author's original intuition about knowledge: "interconnected concepts in some structure." Set theory can't capture this; category theory can. Category theory is the language of *structure* — it describes things by their relationships rather than their internal constitution.

**Key methodological claim**: Exploring "internal essence" always converts to exploring "external relations." To define a word's meaning, we use other words. In the domain of thought, studying structure *is* studying essence.

**On Transcendence (超越)**: What lies "beyond" thought — the process by which things *enter* thought — cannot be studied directly. But we can study the *result* (phenomena as given) and the *evolution* of the structure (how thought changes over time). This leads to studying *functors* — morphisms between categories.

### Category Theory Basics (as used here)

A **category** $\mathcal{C}$ has:
- Objects
- Morphisms (maps between objects)
- Composition of morphisms
- Identity morphisms

**Universal properties**: Initial objects (morphisms go *from* them to everything) and terminal objects (morphisms go *to* them from everything).

**The Magic Book Analogy**: Objects = animals; morphisms = transformation spells. Terminal object = sheep (everything can become a sheep).

### Tower Structure (塔式结构)

A construction where:
- $\mathcal{T}_1$: objects are morphisms of $\mathcal{T}_0$
- $\mathcal{T}_2$: objects are morphisms and objects of $\mathcal{T}_1$
- Continue to $\mathcal{T}_\infty$

**Meta-order**: An object's "level" in the tower. Absolute meta-order = which $\mathcal{T}_n$ it first appears in. Relative meta-order = relative to a chosen "cornerstone" (基石).

### P and E

**P (现象/Phenomenon)**: Everything in "first reality" — all experiences, feelings. Denoted $\mathfrak{P}$ for the complete phenomenon, $\mathfrak{p}$ for parts.

**E ($\mathcal{E}$, 境/Dreamscape)**: A *structure* on P. We *choose* to describe it categorically:
- Objects: selected parts of $\mathfrak{P}$ (experiences)
- Morphisms: connections between them (associations) — also parts of $\mathfrak{P}$, also experiences

**Crucial point**: Since morphisms are also experiences (parts of P), they're also objects. Therefore $\mathcal{E}$ has **tower structure** — it's self-referential.

You can *introspect* to verify this structure. To recall a specific feeling, you can use its structural position in $\mathcal{E}$ as a "map."

### Metaphysics (形而上) in this Framework

**Definition**: A *metaphysical concept* $m$ is a morphism in $\mathcal{E}$ that is a **universal property** in some subcategory $\mathcal{E}_m$.

**Example — "Pen"**: I see pencils, markers, pens. The associations between them (their similarity) form morphisms. The *feeling* I get when I see any pen-like thing — that common experience — is the **terminal object** in this subcategory. This terminal object IS the concept "pen."

**Example — Ship of Theseus**: What is the ship's essence? It's the *experience* that all parts/associations of the ship point toward — the terminal object in $\mathcal{E}_{\text{Theseus}}$. If we wrongly take P as physical world (not phenomena), we get the paradox. The "essence" isn't in the wood — it's in our experience.

**Example — "What is a person?"**: "Person" is the *feeling* you get when you see anything you consider a person. That feeling IS what "person" means. Further inquiry explores the structure *between* that terminal object and concrete instances.

### Meta-Order is Construction-Dependent

$\mathcal{E}$ is *descriptive* (a structure on P), not *constructive* (generating P). Meta-order depends on the construction method chosen. The same structure can be reconstructed different ways:

**Dragon Blood Example**:
- For John (alchemist): human, dragon, blood are same meta-order; dragon-blood is higher
- For Luke (before rebellion): human-blood and dragon are same meta-order; dragon-blood is imagined from them
- For old Luke: human, dragon, blood are same meta-order again

The structure $\mathcal{E}$ doesn't inherently distinguish meta-order — we impose it through construction.

### Metaphysics as Construction

**Definition**: A *construction* on $\mathcal{M}$ is a tower structure built from chosen cornerstones (基石), whose result $\mathcal{T}^\infty = \mathcal{M}$.

**Definition**: A *metaphysics* (第三种形而上) is such a construction.

Specifying a construction = specifying meta-orders for all objects = specifying a "meta-order tuple."

**Two Directions**:

*Top-down (道德仁义礼 version 1)*:
- 道 (0) → 德 (1) → 仁 (1) → 义 (2) → 礼 (3)
- Start from the universal (道), generate particulars
- 道 is the initial object

*Bottom-up (道德仁义礼 version 2)*:
- 礼 (1) → 义 (2) → 仁 (3) → 德 (4) → 道 (5)
- Start from observed phenomena (礼), abstract upward
- 道 is the terminal object

**Both describe the same structure** — just different constructions (different "cartographies").

### Metaphysical Assessment

**On Structural Metaphysics**: This is a bold move — reducing metaphysics to category theory. The claim isn't that reality is categories, but that *thought's structure* can be captured categorically, and "metaphysical concepts" are just universal properties in sub-structures of experience.

**On the Tower Structure**: The self-referentiality ($\mathcal{E}$'s morphisms being also objects) is interesting. It means there's no firm ground-level — the structure goes "all the way down" or loops.

**On the Descriptive/Constructive Distinction**: This is crucial. The author resists claiming we *construct* experience; we *describe* its structure. But choosing a construction (a metaphysics) is choosing how to navigate and understand that structure.

**Resonances**:
- Structuralism in philosophy of mathematics — objects are positions in structures
- Quine's "web of belief" — concepts defined by relations to other concepts
- Wittgenstein's meaning-as-use — but formalized
- Buddhist *pratītyasamutpāda* — things arise in dependence on other things

**Translation Challenges**:
- 境 has no clean English equivalent — "sphere," "realm," "domain," "scape" all miss something
- The technical category theory notation will need careful handling
- The Chinese examples (道德仁义礼) are culturally specific

## Essay 7: 范畴论与境：K1策略 (Category Theory and 境: K1 Strategy)

### Overview
This essay extends the category-theoretic framework to describe the *evolution* of thought (境) over time, and develops a methodology ("K1 Strategy") for using this framework to make philosophically substantive claims that could be empirically tested.

### K1 Form: The Basic Setup

**Evolution functor**:
$$T_t: \mathbb{E}_t \to \mathbb{E}_{t+1}$$

- $\mathbb{E}_t$ = the 境 at a particular moment/state
- $t$ is not necessarily physical time — could be psychological time or other index
- Describes how the structure of thought evolves

**Transformation functors** — extract subcategories from $\mathbb{E}_t$:
- $(F_{E,L})_t$: Language structure $(\mathcal{E}_L)_t \to \mathbb{E}_t$ (inclusion)
- $(F_{L \to M})_t$: Language to Math $(\mathcal{E}_L)_t \to (\mathcal{E}_M)_t$
- Cross-evolution functors: $(F_L)_t: (\mathcal{E}_L)_t \to \mathcal{E}_L$ (embedding temporal into "universal" language category)

### K1 Strategy: Stable Structures

**Core Conjecture**: In the evolution of $\mathbb{E}_t$, there exists some **stable structure $S_E$** that is preserved across time. This structure has a kind of invariance recognizable through $T$.

**Possible interpretations of $S_E$**:
- If $\mathbb{E}_{t_c}$ is the "smallest" $\mathbb{E}_t$ (perhaps early infancy), then $S_{E_c}$ might be "innate cognitive structure"
- If part of $S_E$ is necessary for constructing *any* $\mathbb{E}_t$ from $\mathfrak{P}$, it could be called "cognitive structure"
- Later-acquired stable structures might be "post-natal cognitive frameworks"

**Accessing $S_E$ indirectly**: We can study:
- $S_L$ (stable structure in language evolution) via language games
- $S_M$ (stable structure in mathematical reasoning)
- Through functors $(F_{E,L})_t$, $(F_{E,M})_t$, we can approximate $S_E$:
$$(F_{E,L})_t(S_L) \approx S_E$$

**Key insight**: Structures that can be described in *multiple* formal systems ($\mathcal{E}_L$, $\mathcal{E}_M$, etc.) and transferred between them *must* pass through $\mathbb{E}_t$ and thus capture part of $S_E$.

### K1 Strategy: The Genesis of Knowledge

How does language force knowledge structure to form?

**Knowledge category** $(\mathcal{E}_K)_t$:
- Objects = beliefs
- Morphisms = justification relations (themselves beliefs about what counts as valid reasoning)

**Functor** $(F_{L \to K})_t: (\mathcal{E}_L)_t \to (\mathcal{E}_K)_t$ — some sentences correspond to beliefs in the knowledge network.

**The process**: Playing language games creates new sentences $a$ in $(\mathcal{E}_L)_t$. Through introspection (using $(F_{L \to K})_t$), we map to beliefs and try to integrate them into the knowledge network. Whether the network's stable structure $S_K$ is preserved determines whether the belief is accepted or rejected.

### K1 Strategy: Natural Transformations and Understanding

Consider two paths from $(\mathcal{E}_M)_t$ to $\mathbb{E}_{t+1}$:

1. $(\mathcal{E}_M)_t \xrightarrow{(F_{E,M})_t} \mathbb{E}_t \xrightarrow{T} \mathbb{E}_{t+1}$
2. $(\mathcal{E}_M)_t \xrightarrow{T_M} (\mathcal{E}_M)_{t+1} \xrightarrow{(F_{E,M})_{t+1}} \mathbb{E}_{t+1}$

**Conjecture**: There exists a **natural transformation** between these paths:
$$T \circ (F_{E,M})_t \Rightarrow (F_{E,M})_{t+1} \circ T_M$$

For each formula $a$, there's a morphism $\eta_a$ connecting the two paths.

**What is $\eta_a$?**

Using the example "1+1" $\xrightarrow{T_M}$ "1+1=2":
- Left side: the experience after *thinking about* "1+1"
- Right side: the experience of *seeing* "1+1=2" (after mathematical evolution)
- $\eta_a$ = the *linking experience* between them — like checking your answer against the solution

**When $\eta_a$ is identity**: Your thinking about "1+1" produces the *same* experience as directly seeing "1+1=2" — no confirmation process needed. This is **mastery** of the concept.

**The naturality condition** requires:
- If you can stably reproduce a derivation in your mind
- And you've mastered the conclusion
- Then mastering the premise requires: derive → confirm conclusion → derive back

**Application to Language**:

The structure/meaning question: Which comes first? Answer via natural transformations:
- A sentence is understood when there's alignment ($\eta$) between:
  - The sentence's structural evolution (grammatical unfolding)
  - Your psychological process evolution (mental simulation)

Example: "The cat jumped on the table" — you simulate the cat moving as you parse the grammar. When these align, you "understand."

**Broader claim**: "Understanding" anything = establishing a natural transformation between its structural evolution and your experiential evolution. "I understand" is not ontological confirmation but *experiential confirmation of alignment*.

### KA Conjecture (Sketched)

**Core idea**: Metaphysical concepts (as universal properties, from Essay 6) arise because they form stable structures in the evolution of subcategories of $\mathbb{E}_t$.

**The feeling of completion ($T$)**: When a universal property is reached, there's a "closure" feeling — like finishing an argument, completing a complaint. This is the terminal object of certain subcategories.

**Tension**: When no clear universal property exists — multiple candidates but none fully satisfies — we can't reach $T$. Like being stuck between "save your partner or your parents."

**On children vs. adults**: Children have smaller $\mathfrak{P}_t$, easier to find paths to $T$, easier to feel "complete." Adults have more complex $\mathbb{E}_t$, harder to reach $T$, more "tension."

**Meno's Paradox resolved**: "I don't know" = can't achieve $\eta$ (either missing paths or unresolved tension). We know there's *something* to learn — the structure that would let us reach $\eta$. When we reorganize or add concepts, we "learn."

### K1 Methodology Summary

1. **Transfer method**: Map structures from well-formalized categories (language, math) to harder-to-study categories ($\mathbb{E}_t$). This is what language games already do — now given structural description.

2. **Interpretation method**: Category-theoretic results → philosophical claims.

3. **Introspection method**: Objects/morphisms in $\mathbb{E}$ are experiences. We can access them through introspection. We can construct examples that reliably evoke specific experiences in structural positions.

4. **Philosophical experiments**: If experiences can be stably evoked across people, we've done an experiment. Cross-population comparisons (children vs. adults, theists vs. atheists) might reveal developmental or cultural structures.

5. **Descriptive not normative**: The essay describes structures but doesn't make ontological or value claims about what *should* be pursued.

### Final Reflection

The methodology — constructing structures to evoke experiences — is not unique to category theory. Poetry, art, music, games, cooking, memes all do this. Category theory is just one "scaffolding."

The invitation: re-read Essay 5 (诗意) with this framework. That essay was where 境 was first proposed.

**Extra conjecture**: If we can specify $S_E$ and compatible $\mathfrak{P}$, we might construct entities with different cognitive structures. Candidate: Homotopy Type Theory as $S_E$.

### Metaphysical Assessment

**On the Ambition**: This is an attempt to make metaphysical claims empirically tractable — not by reducing them to physical facts, but by grounding them in experiential structures that can be reliably evoked.

**On Natural Transformations as Understanding**: This is a powerful reframing. "Understanding" isn't about grasping essences but about achieving structural alignment between external forms and internal processes.

**On the Descriptive Stance**: The author is careful to stay descriptive — describing what happens when we understand, not claiming what understanding "really is" metaphysically.

**Resonances**:
- Phenomenology's emphasis on constitution (how experience is structured)
- Wittgenstein's language games as therapy
- Piaget's genetic epistemology (cognitive structures developing over time)
- The enactivist tradition (cognition as structural coupling)

**Translation Challenges**:
- The mathematical notation needs careful handling
- $\eta$ as "confirmation experience" is technical but experientially grounded
- The philosophical experiments proposal is novel — needs clear explanation

## Appendix: 关于诗意和境的一些零散想法

### Key Themes

**On the Human Condition**: Our limitation to phenomena isn't tragedy. Like novels being limited to language, or displays using three primary colors, or twelve-tone equal temperament — limitations enable creation. The "fuzziness" of perception makes art possible.

**Post-metaphysics vs. Pre-metaphysics**: Like the shift from 御史台 (Censorate, requiring the emperor) to 廉政公署 (ICAC, independent structure). Post-metaphysics functions through its structural position, not through appeal to an external authority.

**On Stable Structures**: Physics, psychology, etc. are already practices of finding stable structures in subcategories of 境.

**Poetry and Coin-Flipping**: The coin-flip solution to decision paralysis is *poetic* — you must genuinely believe the coin's result matters. Same with "answer books." We construct a 境 (question-answer context), take it seriously, and thereby gain perspective.

**Self-fulfilling Prophecy**: A form of 境-construction. When successfully built, the evolution produces the predicted result.

**On Death**: 
- Death is transcendent to the self — impossible to "live toward death" (向死而生) in the strict sense
- We can only care about the process of life, not its purpose (purpose lies outside life)
- We can push ourselves from self to self through constructed 境 — like the coin-flip moving us from "stuck self" to "knowing self"

**On Category Theory**: Just one tool among many — logic, poetry, science, aesthetics. Each has strengths and weaknesses. The point is that we're *already* constantly constructing 境 with various tools: language, concepts, institutions, art, memes, room decorations. We are "poets of our own lives."

**Two Questions Addressed**:
1. **How is philosophy possible?** — Must relate to human practice; returns through practice
2. **How is meaning possible?** — Regardless of noumena, how does meaning enter experience?

The second question is "another Kantian question" — the meaning of something is knowledge (synthetic a priori?), not the thing-in-itself. The 境 framework describes this synthesis.

**Favorite Quotes**:
- "Not only the worthy have this mind; all people have it" (孟子)
- Socrates on "wisdom attainable by man" (Plato, Apology)

### Draft Notes

**Two kinds of confusion**:
1. Lacking practical ability
2. Having practical ability but not understanding why we do what we do

Philosophy doesn't provide choices — it reveals why we make them.

**Ultimate Reality**: In A1 strategy terms, ultimate reality is the 0-order object; everything else is morphisms from it to itself (like a group structure). This captures the "unmoved mover" concept. All metaphysical systems might need this structure: a primordial self-to-self morphism generating everything.

**Aesthetics**: The discipline of constructing artworks to evoke experiences, aiming at universal $S_E$ related to "beauty."

**Legitimating Poetic Experience**: As Kant "legitimated empirical science," this framework might "legitimate poetic experience and philosophy."

### Problems Claimed to be Dissolved/Solved
- Collective interest definition
- Knowledge definition
- Absurdism
- Kantian problems
- Existentialism
- Practical definition of "person"
- Ship of Theseus
- Objectification/alienation
- Meaning-structure priority in language
- What is understanding
- What do we understand
- Meno's paradox
- Eastern philosophy's "awakening"
- How philosophy can be practical
- Intersubjectivity

# Second Reading: Critical Observations

## Tensions and Refinements

### 1. Is "Phenomena" Itself Metaphysical?

On second reading, I found the author addresses this in footnote 25 of Essay 4: "第一实在只是名称，而不是现象是否是本体论上具有实在地位的论断" — "First Reality" is just a *name*, not an ontological claim about phenomena's status. This is careful: the framework doesn't claim phenomena are "really real" but only that they're our unavoidable starting point.

**Assessment**: The self-awareness is genuine. The author knows "phenomena" is itself a concept (a Type 0 metaphysical construct). But we can't step below it — doubting phenomena leaves us "no ground to stand on" (无任何可立足之地).

### 2. Normative vs. Descriptive

The framework claims to be descriptive, but several moments introduce apparent normativity:
- We "should" (应当) face meaning poetically
- Non-rationality "should be acknowledged" (应当被承认)
- Denying meaning is "虚妄" (empty and arrogant)

**Assessment**: On closer reading, these aren't really normative. The "should" tracks *what remains possible* after other options are foreclosed:
- After disenchantment, you can't be intoxicated (沉醉) even if you want to
- You can't abandon all dreamscapes because feeling precedes the "I"
- So "should be poetic" = "is the only non-self-deceiving option"

This is closer to "this is what you're doing anyway, now do it knowingly" than "this is what you ought to do."

### 3. Does Category Theory "Cut at the Joints"?

The author explicitly offers three interpretations of the structure/essence relation and then brackets the question: in practice, we can only access structure, so it doesn't matter which interpretation is true.

But in the K1 Strategy essay, something stronger seems implied: stable structures ($S_E$) in the evolution of 境 might correspond to "cognitive structures" or even "a priori" conditions. This is closer to claiming the formalism tracks something real.

**Assessment**: There's a tension between:
- Methodological pragmatism: category theory is just a useful tool
- Implicit realism: stable structures are discovered, not invented

The author is more careful in the main essays, more speculative in the "Todo" sections and appendix. Translation should preserve this register difference.

### 4. Intersubjectivity

My first reading noted this gap. On second reading, I found partial addresses:
- The "philosophical experiments" proposal assumes structures can be reliably evoked across people
- The appendix notes we're "poets of our own lives" — suggesting individual variation
- But no theory of how different 境 relate

**Assessment**: This remains undertheorized. For translation, this is an area where careful readers may have questions. Consider a translator's note.

### 5. The Inversion Thesis

On second reading, the Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li example is even more powerful. The claim isn't just that we *happen* to confuse bottom-up and top-down. It's that the confusion is *structural*: once we form abstractions, we naturally understand them as prior to what they were abstracted from. This is the "失" (loss) built into language and concept-formation itself.

**Assessment**: This has implications for translation itself. Translating concepts like 境 risks the same inversion — readers may take the English term as naming something that exists independently, rather than as a description of experiential structure.

## New Observations

### On the "Two-in-One" Claim

Essay 5 claims feeling and meaning are "两面一体" (two faces of one thing). On second reading, I see this is doing heavy lifting:
- It grounds the impossibility of abandoning all 境 (you can't abandon feeling)
- It dissolves questions like "what gives meaning to feeling?" (the question presupposes separation)
- It aligns with the structural approach: meaning isn't added to feeling but is its structural character

### On the Magic Book Examples

The playful examples (变形术, 魔法书) in the category theory essays are pedagogically effective but also philosophically apt. Magic = transformation that preserves identity (the cat becomes a dog, but *that* cat is now *that* dog). This is what morphisms do: track identity through change.

### On 虚妄

The author's gloss of this term (from 初中 usage!) is revealing: 虚 = empty of substance; 妄 = arrogant, presumptuous. Denying meaning isn't just wrong — it's a form of overreach, claiming to stand outside what one cannot stand outside. This connects to the critique of metaphysics: traditional metaphysics claimed to reach Zeroth Reality; nihilism claims Zeroth Reality doesn't exist. Both overreach.

### Essay 2's Language

Notably, Essay 2 ("A Thought on Knowledge") is written in English. This suggests the author is thinking toward an English-speaking audience from early on. For translation: should this essay be left in English, lightly edited, or fully re-translated from the English original?
