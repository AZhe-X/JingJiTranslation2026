# Translation Dictionary for Metaphysics Terms

## 形而上学
- **Main translation**: metaphysics (the discipline)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "metaphysical inquiry" when emphasizing the investigative aspect
  - "the study of the metaphysical" when clarifying the distinction from 形而上
- **Note**: In classical Chinese, 形而上学 refers to the discipline or study of metaphysics, distinct from 形而上 (the metaphysical constructs themselves). The term derives from the *Yijing* 易经 phrase "形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器" (what is above form is called Dao, what is below form is called vessels/instruments). However, the author explicitly reinterprets this: in the author's framework, 现象 (phenomena) constitute the foundational level, not the generated level, thus inverting the traditional top-down cosmology. The translation must preserve the distinction between metaphysics as a discipline and the metaphysical as content. Confusion with Western "metaphysics" (which blurs this distinction) is a major translation danger.

## 形而上
- **Main translation**: the metaphysical (as adjective/noun); metaphysical construct
- **Alternatives**:
  - "metaphysical understanding" when emphasizing interpretation
  - "metaphysical framework" when referring to systematic constructs
  - "metaphysical object" in technical category-theoretic contexts (as in "metaphysics object of the third kind")
- **Note**: This refers not to the discipline but to the content—the interpretive structures we build upon phenomena. The author states: "形而上 is a kind of understanding/interpretation of phenomena." It is generated from below (from 现象) but appears in our explanatory schemes as if it were generating from above. This is the core of the author's critique of pre-metaphysics: the logical inversion that buries the genetic order. Do not translate as "metaphysics" (which would conflate it with the discipline). The term carries the connotation of "what lies above/beyond form" but in the author's system this "above" is functional and epistemic, not ontological.

## 后形而上学
- **Main translation**: post-metaphysics
- **Alternatives**:
  - "post-metaphysical thinking" (echoing Habermas)
  - "metaphysics after nihilism"
- **Note**: This is not "after and done with" metaphysics but "after and transformed." The author defines it as metaphysics that: (1) takes phenomena as center, (2) acknowledges all 形而上 as constructions upon phenomena, (3) acknowledges non-rationality, (4) has a functional character centered on practice (实践) as the overlap of ideal and phenomenon. The parallel to Habermas's nachmetaphysisches Denken is strong but not exact—the author centers individual phenomenal experience rather than intersubjective discourse. The "post" signifies awareness of the disenchantment of 第〇实在 (ultimate reality) following nihilism, not a rejection of metaphysical thinking per se. Critical danger: do not translate as "postmetaphysics" (one word) which might suggest a total break rather than a transformation.

## 前形而上学
- **Main translation**: pre-metaphysics
- **Alternatives**:
  - "traditional metaphysics"
  - "classical metaphysics"
  - "metaphysics before nihilism"
- **Note**: The author's term for the entire Western and Chinese metaphysical traditions before the advent of nihilism—from Thales through Hegel in the West, from the Yijing through Neo-Confucianism in China. The defining feature is the pursuit of 终极实在 (ultimate reality, 第〇实在) without awareness that this pursuit is non-rational. The author characterizes this tradition as "a progressive retreat from ultimate reality toward practicality" in which "the more one seeks, the more one discovers there is nothing to find." The "pre" is relative to the crisis of nihilism, not chronologically primitive. Must be distinguished from "ancient metaphysics" which would miss the structural designation.

## 第〇实在
- **Main translation**: Zeroth Reality
- **Alternatives**:
  - "Ultimate Reality" (as explanatory gloss, but risks missing the structural numbering)
  - "Reality-Zero" (more colloquial)
- **Note**: This is the author's term for what traditional metaphysics calls 终极实在 (ultimate reality)—the Dao, the Unmoved Mover, God, the thing-in-itself, the noumenon. The "zeroth" numbering is philosophically loaded: it designates a structural placeholder that we can never reach from within the system. We start at 1 (phenomena), proceed to 2 (constructed objects), and can never reach 0. The crucial move is that whenever we articulate 第〇实在, the articulation itself becomes 第二实在 (a construction). This parallels Kant's unknowable thing-in-itself and Wittgenstein's "what can be shown but not said," but is more economical: it is a single structural observation. The translation must preserve the numbering system. The term "ultimate reality" loses the epistemic inaccessibility built into "zeroth." Critical danger: do not translate as "non-reality" or "zero reality" which would suggest non-existence rather than inaccessibility.

## 第一实在
- **Main translation**: First Reality
- **Alternatives**: None recommended (the numbering must be preserved)
- **Note**: This designates phenomena (现象) as what we encounter first, epistemically and practically. CRITICAL: The author explicitly states (footnote 25) that "第一实在" is a name (名称), not an ontological claim that phenomena are the ultimate stuff of reality. It designates epistemic-practical priority: phenomena are indubitable, cannot be bypassed, and are the necessary starting point for all metaphysical construction. This parallels Husserl's principle of principles and the phenomenological Lebenswelt. The "first" means first in the order of access, not first in the order of being. Any translation suggesting ontological foundationalism (like "primary reality" with connotations of "most real") would be a serious error. The translation must include the author's footnote explaining this is a designation of epistemic priority.

## 第二实在
- **Main translation**: Second Reality
- **Alternatives**:
  - "Constructed Reality" (as explanatory gloss, but loses the numbering)
  - "Secondary Reality" (acceptable but "Second Reality" is cleaner)
- **Note**: This consists of the constructions we build upon phenomena—the "things" (东西) we posit as persisting objects, the concepts we abstract, the frameworks we assemble. The objective world (客观世界) is explicitly called a "model" (模型) based on phenomena. This is the domain of 形而上—all our metaphysical constructs live here. The numbering indicates it is reached second, after phenomena. This parallels Kant's empirical objects (constituted through categories), Carnap's framework-internal entities, and scientific models in constructive empiricism. The translation must preserve the constructive character: Second Reality is built from First Reality, not discovered behind it.

## 实在
- **Main translation**: reality (when used alone); actuality
- **Alternatives**:
  - "the real" (when used substantively)
  - "what is real" (when emphasizing question of existence)
- **Note**: This term has a complex relationship to Western "reality." In the author's system, it appears in the three-fold schema (第〇/第一/第二实在) which stratifies what counts as "real" according to epistemic access and constructive order. When used without numerical prefix, 实在 can mean simply "reality" in the ordinary sense, but the author's framework implies we must always ask: which reality? The term carries connotations of substantiality and mind-independence in classical Chinese philosophy, but the author's use is more phenomenological—实在 is what shows up for us, what has presence, not necessarily what exists independently. Danger: translating as "substance" would import Aristotelian baggage; "being" would conflate with 存在.

## 现象
- **Main translation**: phenomena (plural); phenomenon (singular)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "phenomenal experience" when emphasizing the experiential aspect
  - "appearances" (only with strong contextual caveat—see note)
- **Note**: The author uses this term closer to the phenomenological tradition (Husserl, Heidegger) than to Kant. For the author, phenomena are NOT "mere appearances" contrasted with things-in-themselves; they are the indubitable ground of all experience, what cannot be doubted because doubting phenomena leaves no ground to stand on. The author explicitly identifies phenomena with "all feelings/sensations taken together" (全部的感受之总和). This includes both sensory input and the associations/connections between them (which are themselves felt/experienced). CRITICAL: phenomena are not a veil over reality but the inescapable starting point—第一实在. The author states: "我们任何的对于现象的理解，都基于现象" (any understanding we have of phenomena is based on phenomena). Translating as "appearances" risks suggesting they are merely apparent rather than the ground of certainty.

## 恒常
- **Main translation**: constancy
- **Alternatives**:
  - "permanence" (too strong—implies timeless eternity)
  - "invariance" (too technical/mathematical)
  - "regularity" (too weak—misses the identity aspect)
- **Note**: The author identifies constancy as "the core of metaphysics." This is the demand we impose on phenomena—that they will repeat, that same will remain same, that patterns will hold. The author explicitly connects constancy to identity (同一) and causation (因果), noting that causation is just identity across time. This echoes Hume's constant conjunction but goes further: constancy is not a property discovered in the world but a non-rational demand we impose to act meaningfully. Without constancy, we have no "grip" (抓手) on phenomena. The term must convey: (1) something holding steady across change, (2) repeatability, (3) recognizable sameness. "Constancy" in English captures this—it suggests faithful repetition without the excessive strength of "permanence" (which implies unchanging eternality like Platonic Forms) or the weakness of "regularity" (which suggests pattern without identity).

## 境
- **Main translation**: jing (transliterated, with gloss); alternatively "sphere" or "realm"
- **Alternatives**:
  - "sphere" (captures spatial/structural aspect, precedent in Sloterdijk)
  - "realm" (captures domain/region aspect)
  - "experiential sphere" (fuller gloss)
  - "domain" (neutral but less evocative)
  - "境界" as "boundary" or "horizon" (when in compound)
- **Note**: This is the most important and most difficult term in the collection. The author uses it in several interrelated senses: (1) as the title concept (境集, Collection of Jing), (2) as abbreviation of 梦境 (dreamscape/dream-realm), (3) as E in the formal system (the categorical structure on phenomena), (4) as encompassing multiple semantic fields—境界 (boundary/horizon), 环境 (environment), 境地 (situation/predicament), 境 as "state/realm." In the category-theoretic framework, 境 (E) is defined as "a structure on phenomena (P) described categorically: we select parts of phenomena as objects, and connections between them (associations, themselves part of phenomena) as morphisms." The Analysis Report suggests: "The term resists single-word translation because it simultaneously denotes a bounded experiential domain, the structure of that domain, and the felt quality of inhabiting it." I strongly recommend transliteration as "jing" with a glossary entry explaining its semantic range, particularly in formal/technical contexts. In more literary contexts, "sphere" works well. AVOID: "world" (too broad, conflicts with 世界), "state" (too static), "境界" should not be translated as "state" either—prefer "boundary," "horizon," or "limit."

## 境界
- **Main translation**: boundary; horizon; limit
- **Alternatives**:
  - "realm" (when 境界 is used to mean a delimited domain rather than the limit itself)
  - "sphere" (in contexts overlapping with 境)
- **Note**: Compound of 境 (realm/sphere) and 界 (boundary/limit). In classical usage, 境界 can mean "state/level/realm" (as in spiritual attainment), but in the author's more technical usage it emphasizes the boundary or horizon that delimits a 境. The author uses it in phrases like "语言的境界" (the boundary of language) to indicate limits of a domain. The phenomenological parallel is Husserl's "horizon" (Horizont)—the limit of what can be meaningfully entertained within a framework. Do not translate simply as "state" or "level" without considering whether the author means the boundary/horizon itself.

## 虚无
- **Main translation**: nothingness; the void
- **Alternatives**:
  - "nihility" (in contexts about nihilism as philosophical position)
  - "emptiness" (would be better for 空 in Buddhist contexts)
- **Note**: In the author's framework, 虚无主义 (nihilism) is not a positive doctrine but a lack/absence—"not a something, a doctrine, but a nothing, a void." The author states: "Nihilism is not produced or created, just as void is not produced or created, but rather because nothing was produced or created—nothing is here." This is not Buddhist emptiness (空) which has positive ontological significance, but rather the crisis following the loss of 最高价值 (highest values) or 终极实在 (ultimate reality). The translation must avoid suggesting nihilism is a positive philosophy rather than a crisis of absence.

## 本质
- **Main translation**: essence; essential nature
- **Alternatives**:
  - "nature" (in less technical contexts)
  - "whatness" (technical, echoing scholastic "quidditas")
- **Note**: In traditional metaphysics, essence (本质) is what a thing most fundamentally is—its necessary properties, its defining features, its 所以然 (reason for being so). In the author's post-metaphysical framework, what we call "essence" is reinterpreted: the essence of X is not a hidden inner nature but rather the universal property (泛性质/范性质) of a stable subcategory in the structure E—it is that feeling/experience to which all instances of X are connected. For example, "what is 忒修斯之船 (Theseus's ship)? It is that experience which you associate with any part of the ship, or which makes you think of all parts when mentioned." Essence becomes a structural position, not an intrinsic property. Critical translation danger: readers may import substance metaphysics (Aristotelian ousia) when the author has relocated essence to categorical position.

## 存在
- **Main translation**: existence; being; to exist
- **Alternatives**:
  - "being" (when used philosophically/abstractly as in Western "Being")
  - "existence" (when asking whether something exists)
  - "is" / "to be" (in verbal constructions)
- **Note**: This term can function as verb ("to exist") or noun ("existence/being"). The author does not develop a detailed ontology of being/existence (in fact, the framework is designed to avoid traditional ontological commitments), but existence is tied to presence in phenomena: something exists (for us) insofar as it appears in 第一实在 (phenomena) or is a well-grounded construction in 第二实在. The phrase "有效存在" (effective existence) appears in Essay 1, used analogously to renormalization in physics—an entity that "effectively exists" at a given scale without needing to be ontologically fundamental. Do not assume this maps cleanly onto Heidegger's Sein/Seiende distinction—the author's concerns are more epistemological and practical.

## 超越
- **Main translation**: transcendence (noun); to transcend (verb)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "go beyond" (verbal, less technical)
  - "surpass" (when emphasizing exceeding limits)
- **Note**: The author uses this term in specific contexts: (1) the traditional metaphysical quest for 第〇实在 is a (failed) attempt at transcendence—to reach beyond phenomena to ultimate reality; (2) in discussing the evolution of 境, the author mentions "超越" as what lies outside the current boundary of thought—"what enables thought to transcend itself" is what enters thought (the dynamic aspect, 思想之外 entering 思想). The author is clear that true transcendence (reaching 第〇实在) is impossible from within the system, but there is a dynamic sense of "transcendence" as the evolution/transformation of one's experiential sphere. This is not transcendence to a higher realm but immanent self-transformation. AVOID: "transcendental" (Kantian term of art) unless specifically discussing Kant.

## 超越性
- **Main translation**: transcendence (as quality/property); transcendent character
- **Alternatives**:
  - "the transcendent" (substantive)
  - "transcendentality" (rare, but distinguishes from Kantian "transcendental")
- **Note**: The nominal form, referring to the quality of transcending or being transcendent. The author uses this particularly when discussing death: "自己的死亡对于自己是超越性的" (one's own death is transcendent for oneself)—meaning death is beyond the boundary of one's experiential sphere, unknowable from within life. Transcendence (超越性) marks what is outside the 境界 (boundary). This is close to Wittgenstein's "whereof one cannot speak" but applied to experience rather than language.

## 诗意
- **Main translation**: the poetic
- **Alternatives**:
  - "poiesis" (Greek: making/bringing-forth; more technical)
  - "poetic engagement" (fuller gloss)
- **Note**: This is the author's term for the proper post-metaphysical stance toward meaning and existence. It does NOT mean "poetry" in the literary sense. The author defines it as "清醒的梦境" (the lucid dreamscape)—being fully invested in meaning while knowing that meaning is constructed. The poetic stance is contrasted with "沉醉的梦境" (the intoxicated dreamscape, i.e., pre-metaphysical belief/faith where one doesn't realize one is in a dreamscape). The poetic means: (1) knowing you are in a constructed 境, (2) nonetheless fully investing in it and taking it seriously, (3) thereby accessing the experience/meaning it enables. The author states: "清醒不意味着我们对其目的毫不在意，对梦境毫无投入。清醒的梦境依旧也必然意味着对梦境的全身心之投入" (lucidity does not mean we don't care about purpose or invest in the dreamscape; the lucid dreamscape still requires full-hearted investment). This echoes Heidegger's turn to Dichtung (poetry) as authentic dwelling and Nietzsche's affirmation despite the death of God. "Poiesis" (making) might be more precise philosophically, but "the poetic" is more accessible and preserves the connection to poetry/aesthetics which the author invokes in examples (games, novels, art).

## 梦境
- **Main translation**: dreamscape
- **Alternatives**:
  - "dream-sphere" (maintaining connection to 境)
  - "dream-realm"
  - "the oneiric sphere" (highly literary/technical)
- **Note**: The author uses this as a technical term for the experiential environment in which meaning arises. It is defined broadly: "任何感受都有使得他得以展现的'环境'，而这些'环境'即是我所叙的'梦境'" (any feeling has an 'environment' that enables it to manifest, and these 'environments' are what I call 'dreamscape'). Examples include: games (with clear rules/goals), novels (narrative worlds), rituals (like burning incense to express mourning). The "dream" metaphor indicates: (1) constructed/artificial character (not given by nature), (2) immersive quality (you inhabit it), (3) capacity to evoke powerful experience despite being constructed. The author's key insight is that we already live in multiple 梦境 daily—from the frameworks of our concepts to the arrangement of our rooms. "Dreamscape" works well in English because it combines "dream" with "landscape/scope," suggesting both the illusory-yet-serious quality and the spatial/environmental aspect. Connection to "lucid dreaming" (being aware you're dreaming while dreaming) is explicit in the text.

## 沉醉的梦境
- **Main translation**: the intoxicated dreamscape
- **Alternatives**:
  - "the unreflective dreamscape"
  - "faith" or "belief" (as functional equivalents, but lose the 境 structure)
- **Note**: The author's term for pre-metaphysical existence: being in a 梦境 without knowing you're in one. "沉醉" (intoxicated/immersed/absorbed) indicates lack of critical distance. The author identifies this with belief/faith where purpose appears as "logically groundless" (逻辑上无理由的) because one doesn't see it as constructed—it appears as ultimate reality, the unmoved mover, the first cause. This is not merely "false consciousness" (Marxist sense) but a phenomenological description of how meaning appears when the 第〇实在 is not yet disenchanted. The pre-metaphysical person is intoxicated not because they are drunk/impaired but because they are fully immersed without self-awareness of immersion.

## 清醒的梦境
- **Main translation**: the lucid dreamscape
- **Alternatives**:
  - "the self-aware dreamscape"
  - "the reflective dreamscape"
- **Note**: The author's term for post-metaphysical, poetic existence: being in a 梦境 while knowing you're in one, yet still fully investing. "清醒" (lucid/awake/clear-headed) indicates self-awareness. The author explicitly invokes "lucid dreaming" (knowing you're dreaming while dreaming) as the metaphor. This is the stance enabled by recognizing the disenchantment of 第〇实在—you know meaning is constructed (not ultimate), yet you engage fully because (1) feeling/experience is already-given (we cannot not feel), (2) meaning is the twin-face of feeling (意义和感受即是两面一体), (3) full investment is required to access the experience (otherwise the 境 doesn't work—like flipping a coin to make a decision only works if you commit to following it). The English "lucid dreamscape" perfectly captures this via the existing concept of lucid dreaming.

## 德
- **Main translation**: virtue (in Confucian contexts); power (in Daoist contexts); de (transliterated when referring to the philosophical concept)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "excellence" (aretaic sense)
  - "inner power" / "potency" (especially in 道德 Dao-De pairing)
  - "characteristic nature" (when referring to 狗德 dog-nature, 人德 human-nature)
- **Note**: Notoriously difficult term. In the 道德仁义礼 sequence the author analyzes (from Laozi), 德 appears as what is "common to all X" (人德 is what all humans should have; more generally, 德 is the operating principle of each kind of thing). The author's analysis shows: (1) historically, 德 was abstracted from particular 仁 (specific virtues), (2) logically in pre-metaphysics, 德 appears as generating 仁 (because you are human [德], you should have 仁). The translation depends heavily on context. In "人德" (human de), translate as "human nature" or "what makes humans human." In "道德" (Dao-De), consider keeping "De" transliterated or using "virtue/power." The key is recognizing the author is analyzing the structural inversion (genetic vs. logical order), not making claims about what 德 "really means." A translator's note on 德's semantic range (virtue, power, nature, characteristic) is essential.

## 道
- **Main translation**: Dao (transliterated); the Way (traditional rendering)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "the Dao" (with article)
  - "the Way" (only with contextualization)
- **Note**: The author uses 道 primarily in the context of analyzing the 道德仁义礼 sequence from the *Daodejing*, but explicitly states this is NOT an interpretation of Laozi—rather, the sequence serves as an example of the structural inversion (genetic vs. logical order) typical of pre-metaphysics. In that structure, 道 appears as the ultimate generative principle (the most "meta" of metaphysics, 形而上 to the highest degree), yet the author shows it is actually abstracted last (from 德, which is abstracted from 仁, etc.). The author notes: "更加符合道家的关于'道'的解释更类似于使得存在得以成立的那个东西。形象地说，就像是对于一幅画而言的画纸一样" (a more Daoist interpretation of Dao would be like the canvas for a painting—what enables existence). However, in the author's framework, this role is structurally impossible to occupy (it would be 第〇实在, unreachable). Translation recommendation: transliterate as "Dao" and provide footnotes on the structural role in the argument. Avoid over-committing to any particular Daoist interpretation.

## 属性
- **Main translation**: property; attribute
- **Alternatives**:
  - "characteristic" (less technical)
  - "quality" (in some contexts)
- **Note**: The author uses this in the logical/metaphysical sense: a property is what can be predicated of a subject. The critical move in the 道德仁义礼 analysis is that what begins as a property (仁 is a property some people have) becomes transformed into a definition (仁 is what humans essentially are/should be). The author states: "人可以拥有的一个属性，在这里既是'仁'，反而变成了人的一个定义" (a property humans can have, here 仁, instead becomes a definition of humans). This transformation—from contingent attribute to necessary essence—is part of the logical inversion that buries the genetic order. Standard translation as "property" works, but the translator must track where 属性 transforms into 定义 in the author's argument.

## 定义
- **Main translation**: definition
- **Alternatives**:
  - "to define" (verbal)
- **Note**: In formal logic, a definition specifies necessary and sufficient conditions. In the author's analysis, what starts as inductive generalization (a property many Xs happen to have) gets transformed into a definition (what X essentially is, what X must be to count as X). This is the "自上而下" (top-down) explanatory move that inverts the "自下而上" (bottom-up) genetic order. The author notes this happens when we move from "人都是（可以）有仁的" (humans all [can] have ren) to "人都是（应该）有仁的" (humans all [should] have ren) to "有仁的才是人" (only those with ren are [truly] human). Definition thus becomes prescriptive, not merely descriptive. Standard translation as "definition" works if the translator tracks the prescriptive force.

## 范畴
- **Main translation**: category
- **Alternatives**:
  - "范畴论" = "category theory" (the mathematical discipline)
- **Note**: This term has two distinct uses: (1) Kantian categories (pure concepts of understanding like causality, substance), (2) mathematical category theory (objects and morphisms). The author primarily uses it in sense (2) when developing the formal framework (E as a category on phenomena P, with experiences as objects and associations as morphisms). However, there's a deep connection to sense (1): the author's "constancy" (恒常) plays a role similar to Kant's categories—it is a non-rational (but necessary) demand we impose on phenomena to make action possible. The translation must distinguish "category theory" (mathematical) from "categories" (Kantian), though the philosophical overlap is intentional. In mathematical contexts, always "category" (范畴) and never "category theory" unless the text says 范畴论.

## 构造
- **Main translation**: construction; to construct
- **Alternatives**:
  - "configuration" (when emphasizing arrangement)
  - "structure" (overlaps with 结构, use carefully)
- **Note**: The author distinguishes 描述 (description) from 构造 (construction). E (境) is descriptive of P (phenomena), not constructive—E is "a structure on P," not "P is generated by E." However, within the category-theoretic framework, a "构造" is a specific technical notion: "a tower-structure built from a base set of objects (基石) in a specific way, generating the full subcategory M" (see the 道德仁义礼 examples with different orderings). A "metaphysics" (第三种形而上) is defined as a construction on M. The term carries connotations of active building/making, contrasting with passive description or discovery. Standard translation as "construction" works, but note the technical use in the formal sections.

## 感受
- **Main translation**: feeling; experience; sensation
- **Alternatives**:
  - "felt experience" (fuller gloss)
  - "感受" has two senses the author distinguishes in footnote: (1) received information/stimuli (刺激), (2) the "crystallization/flow" that these arrive at (the felt quality)
- **Note**: This is one of the most important terms in the framework. The author explicitly identifies phenomena (现象) with "all feelings taken together" (全部的感受之总和). 感受 is more phenomenological than 感觉 (sensation in the bare sensory sense). The author states meaning and feeling are "two faces of one body" (意义和感受即是两面一体). In the category-theoretic framework, both the objects (experiences) AND the morphisms (associations/connections between experiences) are 感受—they are all parts of phenomena, all felt/experienced. This is why E has tower-structure: the connections between experiences are themselves experiences. Translation must preserve the felt, subjective, experiential quality. "Feeling" works well but may be too emotional; "experience" works but may be too cognitive; context determines best choice. The dual sense (stimulus vs. felt-quality) should be noted in translator footnotes.

## 非理性
- **Main translation**: the non-rational
- **Alternatives**:
  - "non-rationality" (nominal form)
  - AVOID: "irrational" (has pejorative connotations)
  - AVOID: "arational" (too obscure)
- **Note**: This is a crucial concept for the author's framework, and the translation must be precise. "非理性" is NOT "irrational" (against reason, contrary to reason, defective reasoning). It is "outside the domain of reason" or "beyond reason's reach." The author's argument: the purpose of reason must lie outside reason (an analytic truth about purpose—a journey's destination is not the journey itself). Therefore, the pursuit of ultimate reality is non-rational. Therefore, nihilism (as response to loss of ultimate reality) is also non-rational. The author states: "这种非理性是应当被承认的" (this non-rationality should be acknowledged). The "non-rational" is not defective but necessary—it is the domain of will, feeling, attunement. This echoes Schopenhauer's Will, Nietzsche's Dionysian, Heidegger's pre-theoretical Stimmung. The English "the non-rational" (with article, as substantive) correctly captures this: a domain outside reason but not opposed to it, not inferior to it, but simply other. "Irrational" in English means "contrary to reason" or "lacking reason" (pejorative), which would completely misrepresent the author's position.

## 现象礼 / 现象仁 / 现象义
- **Main translation**: phenomenal li (ritual); phenomenal ren (humaneness); phenomenal yi (righteousness)
- **Alternatives**: Keep classical terms transliterated (li, ren, yi) with "phenomenal" qualifier
- **Note**: These are the author's coinages to distinguish the original experiential basis (what is actually felt/observed in phenomena) from the metaphysical constructs (礼, 仁, 义 as abstract principles). "现象X" means "X as it appears in phenomena before being theorized." For example, 现象礼 is the actual behavior of treating others respectfully that I observe; 现象仁 is the actual feeling I have toward others; 现象义 is the actual motivation I feel to act. These are distinguished from 礼/仁/义 as constructed principles that then get inverted (appearing to generate the phenomena rather than being abstracted from them). The translation should preserve the technical distinction by keeping the classical terms transliterated and adding "phenomenal" as qualifier.

## 祛魅
- **Main translation**: disenchantment
- **Alternatives**: None (this is the standard translation)
- **Note**: This directly corresponds to Max Weber's "Entzauberung" and is standard in philosophical translation. The author uses it to describe what happens to 第〇实在 in post-metaphysics: we recognize its "special status" was conferred by non-rational impulse, not by its actual accessibility or ontological privilege. Disenchantment is not a loss but a clarification. The magic is removed not because magic was false, but because we now see it was never the kind of thing that could be accessed/articulated (since any articulation makes it 第二实在, not 第〇实在).

## 终极实在
- **Main translation**: ultimate reality
- **Alternatives**:
  - "absolute reality"
  - "fundamental reality"
- **Note**: This is the ordinary Chinese term for what the author technically designates as 第〇实在 (Zeroth Reality). It refers to what traditional metaphysics seeks: the Dao, the Unmoved Mover, God, the thing-in-itself, the noumenon, Plato's Forms, etc. The author's move is to show this is structurally unreachable: whenever articulated, it becomes 第二实在 (a construction). The translation as "ultimate reality" is standard and captures the intended meaning (the final, foundational, most real reality). The philosophical work is done by the author's argument that this concept is incoherent (or at least inaccessible), not by the translation choice.

## 实践
- **Main translation**: practice; praxis
- **Alternatives**:
  - "practical engagement"
  - "praxis" (when emphasizing Marxist/Aristotelian connotations)
- **Note**: This is the core of the author's post-metaphysics. The author defines the "functional character" of post-metaphysics as "理想和现象之重叠——实践" (the overlap of ideal and phenomenon—practice). Practice is where the metaphysical constructs (第二实在, ideals) and phenomena (第一实在) come together—where we act in the world guided by concepts, and where concepts are tested/revised by experience. This echoes: (1) Aristotle's phronesis (practical wisdom), (2) Marx's praxis (theory-informed action that transforms reality), (3) Dewey's pragmatism (experience as organism-environment interaction). The author states: "我们正是这样的创造者，是自己生命和感受的诗人" (we are creators, poets of our own lives and feelings) through practice. Translation as "practice" works well; "praxis" works in academic contexts.

## 主体间性
- **Main translation**: intersubjectivity
- **Alternatives**: None (technical term)
- **Note**: The author mentions this briefly as one of the "solved problems" but does not develop it in detail in these essays. Intersubjectivity (how multiple subjects/consciousnesses relate, how shared meaning is possible) is a central problem in phenomenology (Husserl) and critical theory (Habermas). The author's framework would presumably address this through the category-theoretic structure: if multiple subjects have similar E structures on overlapping P (phenomena), their 境 can align. The translation is standard philosophical terminology.

## 自我实现
- **Main translation**: self-realization
- **Alternatives**:
  - "self-actualization" (Maslow's term, more psychological)
- **Note**: The author uses this in a specific sense: "使得自我得以成为现实" (making the self become actual/real). This is tied to the need for practice and the overlap of ideal and phenomenon: "我们在现象中看到我们自身，证实我的存在，使得现象成为'我的一部分'" (we see ourselves in phenomena, confirm my existence, make phenomena become 'part of me'). This echoes Hegel's Selbstverwirklichung (spirit actualizing itself in the world) and Marxist self-realization through labor. For the author, self-realization happens when: (1) I act on the world according to my ideals (practical engagement), (2) I see my ideals reflected back in phenomena (the world bears my mark), (3) thereby confirming my existence and extending my 境. "Self-realization" captures this better than "self-actualization" (which is more about fulfilling potential than about making-real).

## 第〇种 / 第一种 / 第二种 / 第三种 (形而上)
- **Main translation**:
  - 第〇种: Zeroth Kind (of metaphysics)
  - 第一种: First Kind
  - 第二种: Second Kind
  - 第三种: Third Kind
- **Alternatives**:
  - "Type Zero, Type One," etc. (but "Kind" better emphasizes qualitative distinction)
- **Note**: This is the author's four-fold classification of metaphysical operations:
  - **Zeroth Kind**: Recognition of "things" and basic abstraction from raw phenomena (e.g., recognizing this apple as a persistent object)
  - **First Kind**: Projection of past regularities into future (induction, prediction)
  - **Second Kind**: Abstracting concepts from repeated patterns (e.g., "honesty" abstracted from honest acts)
  - **Third Kind**: Combination of abstractions into frameworks and values (systematic metaphysics)

  The numbering parallels the 第〇/第一/第二实在 schema. The "zeroth kind" is foundational (works from "original/raw" phenomena) while First and Second kinds can work from both phenomena AND already-formed concepts. All three kinds involve a two-step process: (1) recognition of constancy/repetition, (2) fixing that recognition as a concept detached from particular phenomena. The Third Kind operates on the constructs of the Second Kind. Translation must preserve the numbering system. The parallel to Aristotelian abstraction, Humean induction, and Hegelian systematization is strong.

## 泛性质 / 范性质
- **Main translation**: universal property
- **Alternatives**: None (this is standard mathematical terminology)
- **Note**: This is the standard term from category theory (范畴论). A universal property characterizes an object by its relationships to all other objects in a category (e.g., initial/terminal objects, products, limits). The author uses this philosophically: the universal property of a subcategory is what we experience as the "essence" or "nature" of a concept. For example, in the subcategory of "all things related to me," the universal property (the terminal object to which everything in that subcategory connects) IS the feeling of "me"—that's what "I" am. This is a profound move: essence is relocated from intrinsic nature to categorical position, from substance to structure. The translation must use the standard mathematical term and provide philosophical glosses explaining the application to phenomenology.

## 联想
- **Main translation**: association
- **Alternatives**:
  - "connection" (less technical)
  - "associative link"
- **Note**: In the categorical framework, 联想 are the morphisms (arrows) in E. They are the connections between experiences—when seeing X makes you think of Y, that association is a morphism from X to Y. Crucially, these associations are themselves experiences (感受), which is why E has tower-structure: morphisms are also objects. The term echoes Hume's "association of ideas" (the mind connecting ideas by resemblance, contiguity, causation), but the author's framework is more structural. The association is not just a psychological link but a felt connection that has its own experiential quality. "Association" is the natural English translation and carries the right psychological/philosophical connotations.

## 客观世界
- **Main translation**: objective world
- **Alternatives**:
  - "external world" (when emphasizing mind-independence)
- **Note**: The author's key move: "客观世界 is a model (模型) based on phenomena." This is not metaphysical realism (the view that objective world exists independently) but constructive empiricism: we build a model of an objective world from phenomena (第一实在), and this model (consisting of persistent objects, causal relations, etc.) is 第二实在 (Second Reality). The author states: "形式上，倘若一开始没有任何东西，那么先存在一个真正的客观世界，和先存在现象，有着巨大的区别" (formally, if nothing existed initially, whether a truly objective world or phenomena existed first makes a huge difference). Since we inescapably start from phenomena, we have no access to a "truly objective world" behind them—only our model. Translation as "objective world" is correct but must be accompanied by notes explaining it's a constructed model.

## 元阶 (meta order)
- **Main translation**: meta-order; meta-level
- **Alternatives**:
  - "order" (when clear from context)
  - "level" (less technical)
- **Note**: This is a technical term from the tower-structure construction. In category theory, a "meta-category" treats morphisms as objects. The author constructs: T₀ (base objects) → T₁ (morphisms of T₀ as objects) → T₂ (morphisms of T₁ as objects) → ... → T∞. An object's "绝对元阶" (absolute meta-order) is which level it first appears. An object's "相对元阶" (relative meta-order) is defined relative to a chosen "base stone" (基石). The 道德仁义礼 examples show how the same subcategory can be assigned different meta-orders (orderings) depending on whether we construct bottom-up (from 礼 to 道) or top-down (from 道 to 礼)—these are different "metaphysics" (第三种形而上). Translation should use "meta-order" to preserve the technical sense; explanatory footnotes are essential.

## 基石
- **Main translation**: base stone; foundation stone
- **Alternatives**:
  - "base object" (more technical)
  - "starting point"
- **Note**: In the tower-structure construction, the 基石 are the objects we designate as "absolute 1-meta-order" (or sometimes 0-meta-order if we include a T₀ level). Everything else is constructed from these. Choosing different base stones gives different "constructions" and thus different "metaphysics." For example, in one 道德仁义礼 construction, 道 is the base stone (0-meta-order) and everything is generated from it (top-down metaphysics). In another, 礼 is the base stone and everything is abstracted from it (bottom-up metaphysics). The metaphor of "stone" suggests solidity/foundation. "Base stone" or "foundation stone" captures this; "base object" is more technical but loses the metaphorical force.

## 塔式结构
- **Main translation**: tower structure
- **Alternatives**: None needed (direct translation works)
- **Note**: A category where morphisms are also objects, creating a tower: objects → (morphisms as objects) → (morphisms of morphisms as objects) → .... The author shows that E (境, the categorical structure on phenomena) is a tower structure because associations (morphisms) are themselves experiences (objects). This is formalized through the tower construction (T₀ → T₁ → T₂ → ... → T∞). The "tower" metaphor suggests ascending levels. The structure has a "flattening" quality (压平) when viewed as an arrows-only metacategory—all levels collapse into a single plane of arrows. Translation is straightforward as "tower structure"; mathematical readers will recognize the concept even if not the exact term.

## 稳定子范畴
- **Main translation**: stable subcategory
- **Alternatives**:
  - "stabilized subcategory"
- **Note**: The author's conjecture (KA conjecture, mentioned but not fully developed) is that universal properties in stable subcategories of E correspond to what we experience as "essences." A "stable" subcategory presumably means one that persists across time/evolution of E, though the author does not give a precise definition. This is part of the formal apparatus that "runs ahead of its interpretation" (as the Analysis Report notes). Translation should remain close to mathematical language while noting the interpretation is incomplete.
