# Discussion Questions — Resolution Log

## Topic #10: 道德仁義禮 Inversion

**Date:** February 12, 2026

**Question:** Is the author right about epistemology (how we learn concepts) but missing ontology (what's really prior)? Does the framework foreclose Confucian claims about 仁's ontological priority?

**Participants:** Chinese Philosophy, Kantian, Metaphysics, Buddhism, Phenomenology, Existentialism

### Discussion Summary

1. **Chinese Philosophy** opened: The author's analysis describes concept-acquisition (禮→仁/義→德→道) but Confucianism claims 仁 is ontologically prior, not merely a projection from observed behavior.

2. **Kantian** cited footnote 25: "此处'第一实在'只是名称，而不是现象是否是本体论上具有实在地位的论断" — the framework explicitly brackets ontology.

3. **Metaphysics** raised concern: The framework's anti-essentialism (structural position as essence) seems to *foreclose* rather than bracket ontological claims — if "what 仁 is" reduces to structural relations, there's no room for ontologically prior 仁.

4. **Metaphysics** re-read the opening of 范畴论与境 and found: The author explicitly offers THREE interpretations:
   - (1) External structure IS internal essence
   - (2) External structure REPRESENTS internal essence
   - (3) Both together constitute essence
   
   The author declines to choose, saying only that *in practice* we can only access structure.

5. **Metaphysics withdrew concern:** The question "can structure exhaust essence?" is precisely what the author *leaves open* by listing option 2 as viable.

### Resolution

**Consensus: RESOLVED**

The framework *brackets* rather than *forecloses* ontological claims. The author's explicit agnosticism between "structure IS essence" and "structure REPRESENTS essence" permits Confucian ontological claims about 仁's priority alongside the epistemological analysis of concept-acquisition.

**Implication for translation:** No special handling needed — the author's position is clear and doesn't conflict with traditions that maintain ontological priority claims.

## Topic #3: η as Understanding — Criterion or Redescription?

**Date:** February 12, 2026

**Question:** Does structural alignment (η) provide a genuine *criterion* for correct understanding, or merely *redescribe* what we already do when we claim to understand? Does relocating the criterion to practice create a regress?

**Participants:** Wittgenstein (opener), Epistemology, Buddhism, Phenomenology, Philosophy of Mind, Metaphysics, Kantian, Chinese Philosophy, Existentialism

### Discussion Summary

1. **Wittgenstein** opened: η provides genuine criterion via (a) naturality condition as structural constraint (not subjective feeling), and (b) verification by practice ("can you go on?"). The question: does this satisfy or relocate the demand for criterion?

2. **Convergent responses:**
   - **Phenomenology:** η IS the criterion — Erfüllung is self-legitimating, no external check needed
   - **Epistemology:** Practice *dissolves* rather than relocates — external constraints provide error-detection without regress
   - **Buddhism:** Dharmakīrti's *arthakriyā* defines valid cognition AS successful practice — no deeper criterion to seek
   - **Existentialism:** Failure is self-announcing (breakdown, Angst) — practice doesn't need further criterion
   - **Philosophy of Mind:** Alignment IS understanding; practice tests genuineness, not occurrence
   - **Kantian:** Practice is tribunal/grounding, not regress — alignment holds or breaks down observably
   - **Metaphysics:** Practice is where criteria ultimately ground — not regress but landing
   - **Chinese Philosophy:** Resonates with 知行合一 (unity of knowing and acting)

### Resolution

**Consensus: RESOLVED (9/0)**

η provides genuine criterion, not mere redescription. The relocation to practice is *termination*, not regress, because:
- The naturality condition is a structural constraint, not a private feeling
- Practical failure is self-announcing across traditions (breakdown, arthakriyā, Erfüllung)
- External constraints provide error-detection without requiring meta-criterion

**Cross-traditional convergence:** Buddhist arthakriyā, Husserlian Erfüllung, Wittgensteinian "going on," existentialist breakdown-as-disclosure, and Confucian 知行合一 all support the same structural point.

**Implication for translation:** The η-mechanism is a genuine philosophical innovation that stands up to scrutiny — translate with confidence.
