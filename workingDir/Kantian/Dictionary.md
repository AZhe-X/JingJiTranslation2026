## 现象 (xiànxiàng)
- **Main translation**: Phenomenon / Phenomena (plural)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "Experiential field" when emphasizing the totality of what is given
  - "Appearance" in explicitly Kantian contexts (to align with *Erscheinung*)
  - Keep "phenomenon" in most cases with translator's note
- **Note**: While the standard translation "phenomenon" invokes Kant's *Erscheinung*, the author's usage is broader and more phenomenologically immediate. For Kant, phenomena are always already constituted by the forms of intuition (space/time) and categories of understanding. The author's 现象 refers to raw experiential content prior to any intellectual processing—closer to the "manifold of intuition" before synthesis, or to Husserlian *Erlebnis* (lived experience). The author explicitly identifies 现象 as 第一实在 (First Reality), the indubitable starting point of all cognition. This is the empirical given, but not yet structured as Kantian appearance. Translation should preserve this pre-constitutive immediacy while acknowledging Kantian resonance.

---

## 第一实在 (dì yī shízài)
- **Main translation**: First Reality
- **Alternatives**:
  - "Primary reality" when emphasizing epistemic order
  - "Phenomenal reality" in explicitly contrastive contexts
- **Note**: This is the author's coinage for what we "possess" (拥有) first—现象 understood as our indubitable epistemic ground. The ordinal "first" is temporal/epistemic (what we encounter first), NOT ontological (what exists first). This parallels Kant's "empirical reality" (*empirische Realität*) but with crucial difference: Kant's empirical reality is already transcendentally constituted, whereas the author's 第一实在 precedes all constitution. The footnote explicitly states this is a *name*, not an ontological claim. The author's insistence that 现象 is 无可怀疑 (indubitable) echoes Kant's transcendental argument that all cognition begins with experience. Translator should note that "First" refers to order of access, not order of being.

---

## 第〇实在 (dì líng shízài)
- **Main translation**: Zeroth Reality
- **Alternatives**:
  - "Zero-Reality" (hyphenated) for emphasis
  - "Ground Reality" in metaphysical contexts where the ordinal nature is clear
- **Note**: The author's term for what traditional metaphysics posits as ultimate ground—structurally parallel to Kant's thing-in-itself (*Ding an sich*) or noumenon. The mathematical/ordinal "zeroth" evokes something "prior to" First Reality in logical/ontological order. Critically, the author argues: "对于我们而言，并不存在第〇实在，而只存在第二实在。当我们提出第〇实在时，这个我们所提出的东西就是第二实在" (For us, Zeroth Reality does not exist; only Second Reality exists. When we propose Zeroth Reality, what we propose is already Second Reality). This precisely mirrors Kant's doctrine that the thing-in-itself is a *Grenzbegriff* (limiting concept, B310-311)—it cannot be known, and any determination of it transforms it into phenomenon. The Daoist parallel: 真正的道不可道不可名 (the true Dao cannot be spoken or named). The post-metaphysical twist: the author performs a "disenchantment" (祛魅) that goes beyond Kant—the very *desire* for 第〇实在 is recognized as non-rational (非理性), whereas Kant treats the noumenon as a necessary thought of reason.

---

## 第二实在 (dì èr shízài)
- **Main translation**: Second Reality
- **Alternatives**:
  - "Constructed reality" when emphasizing the generative process
  - "Conceptual reality" in epistemological contexts
  - "Metaphysical constructs" when referring to multiple instances
- **Note**: The reality we construct from 第一实在—all our concepts, theories, and structured understanding of phenomena. This corresponds roughly to Kant's "object of experience as constituted by the understanding." In the Daoist example: 道德仁义礼 as articulated concepts are all 第二实在, constructed upward from 现象 but *understood* (in pre-metaphysics) as if they descended from 第〇实在. The key post-metaphysical recognition is that all 形而上 (the metaphysical) is 第二实在—constructed from phenomena, not grounding them. This parallels the "Copernican revolution" in Kant's CPR, where objects must conform to our cognition rather than vice versa. However, the author goes further: even the noumenon, once articulated, becomes Second Reality.

---

## 形而上学 (xíng ér shàng xué)
- **Main translation**: Metaphysics
- **Alternatives**:
  - "Metaphysical inquiry" to emphasize the disciplinary aspect
  - "Metaphysical studies" in academic contexts
- **Note**: The discipline/study of 形而上 (the metaphysical). The Chinese etymology from *Yijing* 系辞传: "形而上者謂之道，形而下者謂之器" (What is above form is called Dao; what is below form is called implements). Standard translation of "metaphysics" (from Greek *meta ta physika*). The author carefully distinguishes 形而上学 (the study) from 形而上 (metaphysical constructs themselves). Western metaphysics seeks *ultimate reality* (终极实在); Chinese thought more often operates *within* given 形而上 frameworks to reach 至善 (supreme good) and cultivate 圣人 (the sage). The author's critical move: all metaphysics rests on the non-rational (非理性) pursuit of constancy (恒常). This genealogy is closer to Nietzsche than Kant, though the framework remains transcendental in structure.

---

## 形而上 (xíng ér shàng)
- **Main translation**: The metaphysical / metaphysical construct(s)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "Metaphysical structure" when referring to systematic constructions
  - "Supra-phenomenal" to emphasize the beyond-phenomenon aspect
  - "Abstract concept" in simpler contexts
- **Note**: A property or construct that stands "above" phenomena—any concept, category, or structure abstracted from 现象. The author reinterprets 形 as 现象 (phenomenon) rather than the traditional reading, making 形而上 literally "that which is above/upon phenomena." This is NOT ontologically prior but epistemically derivative—built UP from phenomena, though traditionally *understood* as descending DOWN to generate phenomena. The author identifies three types: 第〇种 (recognition of repeated patterns), 第一种 (predictive generalizations), 第二种 (abstraction into concepts). The core of all 形而上 is 恒常 (constancy)—the pursuit of invariant structure amid change. In Kantian terms, this includes both empirical concepts and pure concepts (categories), but the author's framework does not distinguish them as sharply. The author's universal property (泛性质) definition from category theory: 形而上 is a universal property in a subcategory of E (境).

---

## 后形而上学 (hòu xíng ér shàng xué)
- **Main translation**: Post-metaphysics
- **Alternatives**:
  - "Post-metaphysical thought" when referring to the approach
  - "After metaphysics" for literal emphasis
- **Note**: Metaphysics *after* nihilism—after the recognition that 第〇实在 has no special epistemic privilege and that the pursuit of ultimate ground is non-rational. This is NOT anti-metaphysical or a rejection of 形而上; rather, it is metaphysics with explicit recognition that all metaphysical constructs are built from 现象 upward, not given from above. The key moves: (1) disenchantment (祛魅) of 第〇实在; (2) recognition of the non-rational (非理性) drive underlying metaphysical construction; (3) acknowledgment that 现象 occupies the structurally primary position. The method is 实践 (practice)—the "overlap of ideal and phenomenon" (理想和现象之重叠). This parallels Kant's limitation of metaphysics in CPR but goes further: Kant cordons off noumena while maintaining their regulative function; the author accepts the non-rationality at the foundation and builds post-metaphysics as deliberate, acknowledged construction. Closer to Nietzsche's "gay science" or pragmatist/constructivist approaches, but retaining transcendental structure.

---

## 先验 (xiān yàn)
- **Main translation**: A priori / transcendental (context-dependent)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "A priori" when referring to knowledge independent of experience
  - "Transcendental" when referring to conditions of possibility of experience
  - Keep Chinese term with gloss in highly technical passages
- **Note**: Standard translation of Kant's *a priori* (prior to experience) and *transzendental* (concerning conditions of possibility). In the K1 strategy essay, the author writes: "如果你认为这一时刻是某种E_t首次出现的时刻...则你可以将这种稳定结构当中的这一部分认定为'先天'" (If you consider this the moment of E_t's first appearance, independent of experience, you may identify this part of the stable structure as "a priori"). The author's S_E (stable structure preserved under evolution functor T) plays the role of Kantian a priori structures—forms of intuition and categories—but the author leaves S_E formally unspecified and proposes to discover it empirically through "philosophical experiments." This is methodologically post-Kantian: the *form* of synthetic a priori knowledge, but the *content* left to empirical investigation. The author deliberately withholds Kant's strong modal claims while retaining the structural insight.

---

## 范畴 (fànchóu)
- **Main translation**: Category (context determines mathematical or philosophical sense)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "Category" (mathematical category theory) in technical passages
  - "Category of understanding" when explicitly invoking Kant
  - Distinguish by capitalization or context
- **Note**: Dual usage: (1) Philosophical—Kant's *Kategorien*, the pure concepts of understanding that structure experience (substance, causality, etc.); (2) Mathematical—category theory (范畴论), the formal language the author uses to describe the structure of 境. The author's major innovation: replacing Kant's table of twelve categories (derived from logical forms of judgment) with category-theoretic structures. Universal properties (泛性质) replace Kantian categories; functors replace schematism; natural transformations replace synthetic unity of apperception. This is structure-first rather than logic-first. The advantage: formal precision and generativity beyond Kant's discursive formulations. The shift: from Kant's fixed categories to dynamically evolving cognitive structures described by functors.

---

## 构造 (gòuzào)
- **Main translation**: Construction / constitute (verb: construct)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "Constitution" when emphasizing transcendental constitution
  - "Building" in simpler contexts
  - "Synthesis" when the Kantian parallel is explicit
- **Note**: The process by which 第二实在 is built up from 第一实在; the generation of structured 境 from raw phenomena. Parallels Kant's *synthesis*—the activity of the understanding that combines the manifold of intuition into unified experience. However, the author's usage is broader and more dynamic: construction includes not just cognitive synthesis but practical, linguistic, and cultural construction. The author's "construction" (构造) in category theory refers to the *塔式构造* (tower construction) by which higher-order structures emerge from lower-order ones. This formalizes what Kant described discursively: how concepts of increasing generality/abstraction arise from more concrete contents. The key difference: the author treats construction as ongoing, revisable, and multiple (different constructions possible), whereas Kant's synthesis via the categories is fixed and universal.

---

## 综合 (zōnghé)
- **Main translation**: Synthesis / synthetic
- **Alternatives**:
  - "Combination" in non-technical contexts
  - "Synthetic judgment" when discussing knowledge claims
- **Note**: Kant's *Synthesis*—the act of combining different representations and grasping their manifoldness in one cognition. In Kant, synthesis is the fundamental operation of understanding; all knowledge involves synthesis of intuitions under concepts. The author uses this term in parallel sense: the subjective synthesis of phenomena to produce meaning. In the appendix essay, the author writes: "一件事物的意义是什么这一问题的回答可能是一种知识（即可能是一种先天综合判断）...通过对现象的主观综合而来" (The answer to "what does X mean" may be a kind of knowledge—synthetic a priori judgment—arising through subjective synthesis of phenomena). This extends Kant's synthetic a priori from mathematics/natural science to the domain of meaning. The framework: meaning has the same epistemic structure as scientific knowledge—it emerges from structural conditions (S_E) through which experience is constituted, not from bare experience or pure concepts alone.

---

## 分析 (fēnxī)
- **Main translation**: Analysis / analytic
- **Alternatives**:
  - "Analytical judgment" in epistemological contexts
  - "Decomposition" when emphasizing the breaking-down aspect
- **Note**: Kant's *Analytik* and *analytische Urteile* (analytic judgments)—judgments in which the predicate is contained in the concept of the subject (e.g., "All bachelors are unmarried"). Contrasts with synthetic judgments, which add new information. Kant's critical question: "How are synthetic a priori judgments possible?" The author adopts this distinction in discussing knowledge but focuses primarily on the synthetic—how new understanding arises. The author's main concern is with construction (synthesis), not decomposition (analysis), though both are operative in the formation and clarification of concepts.

---

## 境 (jìng)
- **Main translation**: Jing (keep untranslated with gloss) / experiential realm
- **Alternatives**:
  - "Experiential realm" as translation
  - "Field of experience" in some contexts
  - "Lifeworld" if invoking Husserl
  - "境-structure" when emphasizing the formal structure
- **Note**: The central concept. E (境) = Enclosed + Emotion + Experience. The structured totality of experience at a moment—现象 with structure imposed on it. In category theory: 境 is a category whose objects are selected from phenomena (感受) and whose morphisms are associations (联想, also 感受). Critically, morphisms are also objects (making E a tower structure / arrows-only metacategory). No direct Kantian equivalent, but resonates with several concepts: Husserl's "field of consciousness," Heidegger's "world" (*Welt*), Kant's "unity of apperception" as the unified field of experience. The Buddhist/Chinese aesthetic term 境界 (realm, state of mind) underlies this usage. The author's innovation: formalizing this with category theory to describe both the structure and its evolution (via functor T). In Kantian terms, 境 is experience *as structured by the subject*, but the author does not presume Kant's specific forms (space/time) or categories. Instead, the structure is to be discovered empirically. Recommended: Keep "Jing" untranslated in the main translation with explanatory notes, using "experiential realm" or "境-structure" where clarification is needed.

---

## 恒常 (héngcháng)
- **Main translation**: Constancy
- **Alternatives**:
  - "Permanence" when invoking Kant's First Analogy explicitly
  - "Invariance" in mathematical/formal contexts
  - "Stability" when discussing stable structures
- **Note**: The core of all 形而上—the pursuit of invariant structure amid phenomenal change. The author writes: "形而上的核心是恒常" (The core of the metaphysical is constancy). This is what we seek when we form concepts, make predictions, abstract generalizations—a "guarantee" (保证) that the same structures will recur. In Kantian terms, this resonates with the First Analogy of Experience—the principle of the permanence of substance (CPR A182/B224). For Kant, permanence is a transcendental condition: without something permanent in intuition, no time-determination is possible, hence no experience. The author's 恒常 is both the *object* of metaphysical pursuit and the *structural feature* preserved by evolution functor T in stable structure S_E. This is the non-rational drive (非理性) underlying all cognition: the need for "handles" (抓手) on phenomena to make meaningful action possible. Translation: "constancy" avoids the excessive Kantian specificity of "permanence" while preserving the sense of temporal/structural invariance.

---

## 感受 (gǎnshòu)
- **Main translation**: Feeling / sensation (context-dependent)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "Sensory experience" when emphasizing empirical input
  - "Affective experience" when emphasizing emotion
  - "Experiential content" in formal contexts
- **Note**: The fundamental unit of P (现象). The author writes: "即便对于客观世界模型来说，任何对于我们有影响的事物都必须通过'感受'或者'体验'以'进入'我们的'视野'以成为'现象'" (Even for the objective world model, anything that affects us must enter our view through "feeling" or "experience" to become "phenomenon"). This is phenomenologically immediate—the raw "what it is like" of experience. Closer to the sensory "matter" of appearance in Kant's terminology, or to *Empfindung* (sensation), but without Kant's sharp form/matter distinction. The author treats 感受 as both objects and morphisms in E—both the contents of experience and the associative links between them. This anticipates the tower structure of 境. Translation: "feeling" for affective/phenomenological contexts; "sensation" when emphasizing sensory input; clarify with context.

---

## 经验 (jīngyàn)
- **Main translation**: Experience
- **Alternatives**:
  - "Empirical experience" when contrasting with a priori
  - "Experiential" (adjective)
- **Note**: Kant's *Erfahrung*—structured, unified cognition of phenomena. For Kant, experience is always already synthesized by the understanding via the categories; it is not mere perception but cognition of objects in accordance with rules. The author uses 经验 similarly—experience as structured by 境, not raw phenomena. However, the author's framework allows for more radical variability in experiential structure across individuals and developmental stages (via different S_E), whereas Kant insists on universal forms. The author's post-metaphysical stance: experience is the starting point (第一实在) and the site of all construction, but its structure is not deduced a priori (as in Kant) but investigated empirically through "philosophical experiments."

---

## 体验 (tǐyàn)
- **Main translation**: Lived experience / concrete experience
- **Alternatives**:
  - "Experiential episode" for individual instances
  - "Experiencing" (gerund) to emphasize process
- **Note**: Often synonymous with 感受 in the author's usage but with a more holistic connotation—the *living through* of experience, not just isolated sensations. Closer to Husserl's *Erlebnis* (lived experience) or Dilthey's *Erleben*. The author uses 体验 and 感受 somewhat interchangeably to denote the contents of 现象/P. In contexts where distinction matters, 体验 suggests richer, more integrated experiential episodes (e.g., aesthetic experience, emotional states), while 感受 can refer to more elementary sensory/affective units. Translation flexibility: use "lived experience" for phenomenological emphasis, "experience" in general usage.

---

## 非理性 (fēi lǐxìng)
- **Main translation**: The non-rational
- **Alternatives**:
  - "Non-rational drive" when referring to the underlying impulse
  - "Arational" to emphasize not anti-rational but outside reason's scope
- **Note**: NOT "irrational" (which implies opposition to reason or irrationality as defect). "Non-rational" indicates something outside reason's domain but not thereby condemned. The author's critical claim: "理性的目的必然要在理性之外...理性仅仅作为一种工具而存在" (Reason's purpose must lie outside reason...reason exists only as a tool). Therefore: "对终极实在的追求本身就是非理性的（形而上学本身就是非理性的）" (The pursuit of ultimate reality is itself non-rational; metaphysics itself is non-rational). The drive for 恒常 (constancy), for "handles" on phenomena, for self-realization through practice—all are 非理性. This must be *acknowledged* (承认), not overcome. This marks a departure from Kant: for Kant, reason's demand for the unconditioned (the Ideas of Reason) is *rational*, even if it cannot be satisfied theoretically. The author's genealogy is closer to Nietzsche (the will to power underlying reason) or Schopenhauer (the Will underlying representation). However, the author does not valorize the non-rational over the rational; instead, post-metaphysics *acknowledges* both and works with them in 实践.

---

## 理性 (lǐxìng)
- **Main translation**: Reason / rationality
- **Alternatives**:
  - "Rational faculty" when referring to Kant's *Vernunft*
  - "The rational" as substantive
- **Note**: Kant's *Vernunft* (Reason) vs. *Verstand* (Understanding). In Kant's architecture, Understanding applies categories to intuitions to produce experience; Reason seeks systematic unity and generates the Ideas (God, freedom, immortality). The author uses 理性 more generally for the capacity for conceptual thought, inference, justification—the "rational" dimension of cognition. The key post-metaphysical move: reason is a *tool* (工具), and its purposes are non-rational (非理性). This deflates reason from its Kantian status as the source of necessary structures (categories) and regulative ideals (Ideas) to a means in service of non-rational ends. However, the author does not abandon rational inquiry; rather, post-metaphysics acknowledges that reason operates within bounds set by non-rational drives (for constancy, self-realization) and returns to phenomena through practice.

---

## 超越 (chāoyuè)
- **Main translation**: Transcendence / to transcend
- **Alternatives**:
  - "Surpassing" when emphasizing the movement beyond
  - "Going beyond" in simpler contexts
- **Note**: Going beyond current limits—of experience, of the self, of a given 境. The author distinguishes: (1) 超越 of the 境界 (boundary) of thought—moving from one cognitive/experiential structure to another (e.g., via evolution functor T); (2) The unattainable 超越 toward 第〇实在, which is non-rational and always transforms into 第二实在 when articulated. In Kantian terms, *transzendental* (transcendental) refers to conditions of possibility of experience; *transzendent* (transcendent) refers to what lies beyond possible experience. The author's usage is closer to the latter—transcendence as the movement beyond a given boundary. However, post-metaphysics recognizes that we cannot transcend phenomena themselves (第一实在), only move from one structured configuration (境) to another. The author's notion of 超越 is more akin to Heidegger's *Überstieg* or existentialist notions of self-overcoming than to Kant's transcendental method.

---

## 超越性 (chāoyuè xìng)
- **Main translation**: Transcendence (substantive) / transcendent quality
- **Alternatives**:
  - "Transcendent dimension" when referring to what lies beyond
  - "The transcendent" as philosophical term
- **Note**: The quality or dimension of what lies beyond (a 境, a framework, the self). The author writes: "超越之所在是（可以）存在的" (Transcendence can exist), but it is not directly accessible—we encounter only its "results" (the phenomena that are "放入篮子," placed in the basket). In Kantian terms, this is the transcendent realm (God, noumena, things-in-themselves)—posited but unknowable. The author's twist: we study the *manifestation* of transcendence (how phenomena change, how 境 evolves), not transcendence itself. This is the research program of K1 strategy: to study the evolution of 境 (via functor T) to understand how "what enters the basket" (what becomes phenomenon) structures experience. The author's 超越性 is not a separate ontological realm but the *dynamic* dimension of experience—the fact that 境 evolves, that new structures emerge, that we are not trapped in a static framework.

---

## 自然变换 (zìrán biànhuàn)
- **Main translation**: Natural transformation
- **Alternatives**: None (this is a technical term from category theory)
- **Note**: A concept from mathematical category theory: a natural transformation η between two functors F and G (both from category C to D) assigns to each object X in C a morphism η_X: F(X) → G(X) in D, such that for every morphism f: X → Y in C, the naturality condition holds: G(f) ∘ η_X = η_Y ∘ F(f). The author's philosophical application: a natural transformation between the evolution of formal structures (language, mathematics) and the evolution of experience (境) is the condition of *understanding*. When we "understand" a sentence, a formula, or a phenomenon, we establish a natural transformation linking the structural unfolding of that object with our experiential/cognitive process. The η morphisms represent the "feeling of alignment" (一致性感受) or "confirmation" (确认). When η is the identity morphism, we have *mastery* (掌握)—direct, immediate understanding without mediation. This is a profound formalization of what it means to "get it": the isomorphism (or at least systematic correspondence) between external structure and internal process. In Kantian terms, this formalizes the schematism—the mediating process between pure concepts and sensible intuitions—and extends it to meaning, aesthetics, and all understanding.

---

## 函子 (hánzǐ)
- **Main translation**: Functor
- **Alternatives**: None (technical term from category theory)
- **Note**: A structure-preserving map between categories. A functor F: C → D maps objects of C to objects of D and morphisms of C to morphisms of D, preserving composition and identities. The author's key application: the evolution functor T: E_t → E_{t+1} describes how 境 changes over "time" (t need not be physical time—any label for developmental/processual stages). Various "转换函子" (transformation functors) map between subcategories: F_{E,L} embeds language-境 into total 境; F_{L→K} maps language to knowledge; etc. Functors formalize processes: learning, understanding, conceptual development, structural change. This is the author's major methodological innovation beyond Kant: Kant's framework is static (the categories do not evolve); the author introduces dynamics via functors. This allows for developmental psychology, historical/cultural variation in cognitive structures, and individual differences—all within a transcendental-style framework.

---

## 稳定结构 (wěndìng jiégòu)
- **Main translation**: Stable structure
- **Alternatives**:
  - "Invariant structure" when emphasizing what is preserved
  - "Structural invariant" in mathematical contexts
- **Note**: The structure S_E preserved under the evolution functor T—what remains constant as 境 evolves. This is the formal counterpart to 恒常 (constancy). The author's conjecture: there exists a stable structure S_E such that T(S_E) ≅ S_E (T preserves S_E, up to isomorphism). If S_E can be identified at the earliest stage E_{t_c}, it becomes a candidate for "a priori cognitive structure" (先天认知结构)—though the author is careful to note this is descriptive, not prescriptive, and requires empirical investigation via "philosophical experiments." In Kantian terms, S_E corresponds to the forms of intuition (space/time) and categories of understanding—the necessary structures without which no experience could be constituted. The key differences from Kant: (1) S_E is not deduced from the table of judgments but conjectured and investigated; (2) S_E may vary across individuals/populations/developmental stages; (3) S_E is discovered by examining what structure remains invariant under T, not by transcendental deduction. This is the empirical-transcendental synthesis the author proposes: transcendental in form (conditions of possible experience), empirical in method (discovered through investigation of experiential evolution).

---

## 认知结构 (rènzhī jiégòu)
- **Main translation**: Cognitive structure
- **Alternatives**:
  - "Epistemic structure" when emphasizing knowledge
  - "Conceptual framework" in less technical contexts
- **Note**: The structural features of 境 that enable cognition. The author writes: "如果你认为E表示了某种认知，那么假如能够证明这一稳定结构当中的一部分一旦缺失，则无法从P_t中构建任何E_t，则可以将这部分稳定结构称之为'认知结构'" (If E represents cognition, and if it can be shown that without part of the stable structure, no E_t can be constructed from P_t, then this part may be called "cognitive structure"). This is a transcendental argument: X is a cognitive structure if X is a necessary condition for constructing 境 from phenomena. Parallel to Kant's categories as conditions of the possibility of experience. The author's framework allows for empirical investigation of what these structures are (via philosophical experiments across populations), whereas Kant deduces them a priori. In contemporary terms, this bridges transcendental philosophy and cognitive science—an empirical search for innate or developmentally necessary cognitive structures, but framed within a transcendental architecture (conditions of possibility).

---

## Additional Terms

### 泛性质 (fàn xìngzhì)
- **Main translation**: Universal property
- **Note**: Technical term from category theory. An object X in category C has a universal property if every other object in C (or in a relevant subcategory) maps to/from X in a unique way. The author's definition of 形而上: "一个形而上m是E中的联想，且m在E的某个子范畴中是范性质" (A metaphysical construct m is a morphism in E, and m is a universal property in some subcategory of E). Example: the concept "笔" (pen) is a universal property in the subcategory of E containing 铅笔, 钢笔, 粉笔, etc. The "feeling" we get when seeing any pen is the universal property—the limit/terminal object toward which all specific pen-experiences map. This formalizes what Kant called the "schema" of a concept and what traditional metaphysics called the "essence" or "universal."

### 塔式结构 (tǎ shì jiégòu)
- **Main translation**: Tower structure
- **Note**: A category where morphisms are also objects, constructed iteratively: T_0 (base category) → T_1 (objects are morphisms of T_0) → T_2 (objects are objects and morphisms of T_1) → ... → T_∞. The author's 境 (E) is a tower structure because morphisms (associations, 联想) are also experiential contents (感受), hence also objects. This structure allows for meta-levels: thinking about thinking, concepts of concepts, associations between associations. This formalizes the reflexivity of consciousness and the hierarchical structure of abstraction. No direct Kantian parallel, but related to Fichte's reflexive self-positing of the I.

### 实践 (shíjiàn)
- **Main translation**: Practice / praxis
- **Note**: The core methodological principle of post-metaphysics: "理想和现象之重叠" (the overlap of ideal and phenomenon). Through practice, we construct 境, test them against phenomena, and iterate. This is not Kant's "practical reason" (moral/volitional) but closer to pragmatist or Marxist praxis—the active, iterative engagement with the world that constitutes both self and world. Practice is how post-metaphysics avoids dogmatism: we acknowledge that all constructs are 第二实在 (Second Reality), and we test them through practice, revising as needed. This is the post-metaphysical answer to nihilism: not "nothing matters" but "we construct what matters, and practice tests and refines our constructions."

### 诗意 (shīyì)
- **Main translation**: The poetic / poetic engagement
- **Note**: The author's term for the proper stance after post-metaphysical recognition. "清醒的梦境" (lucid dreaming)—we construct and inhabit meaningful structures while knowing they are constructions. Not Kant's "discipline of pure reason" but closer to Nietzsche's "gay science," Heidegger's "poetic dwelling," or Daoist "play" (游). The poetic is the *freedom* to construct境, to engage with experience creatively, aesthetically, meaningfully, without metaphysical illusion but also without nihilistic despair. This is the post-metaphysical resolution: neither dogmatic belief in 第〇实在 nor nihilistic rejection of all 形而上, but deliberate, acknowledged, joyful construction.

## Conclusion

This dictionary provides translation recommendations grounded in the Kantian/transcendental philosophical tradition while acknowledging the author's innovations and divergences. The author's framework is recognizably transcendental in structure (phenomena → conditions of possibility → structured experience) but post-Kantian in method (empirical investigation, dynamic evolution, explicit acknowledgment of non-rationality). Translation should preserve both the Kantian resonances (for Western philosophical readers) and the author's original contributions (category-theoretic formalization, post-metaphysical stance, integration of Chinese philosophical concepts).

For the translation team: Consistency in rendering these key terms across all essays is critical. Where the author's usage diverges from standard Kantian vocabulary, translator's notes should clarify both the parallel and the difference. The goal is to make this work accessible to readers in the Western philosophical tradition while preserving its originality and rigor.
