## Topic #10 — 道德仁義禮 Inversion

**Date:** 2026-02-12

**Question:** Does the author's epistemological analysis (禮→仁/義→德→道) foreclose Confucian ontological claims about 仁's priority, or merely bracket them?

**Opening:** Chinese Philosophy Advisor raised concern that reducing 仁 to structural position in 禮-phenomena might miss the Confucian claim that 仁 is ontologically constitutive of humanity.

**Key Evidence:**
1. **Footnote 25:** "此处'第一实在'只是名称，而不是现象是否是本体论上具有实在地位的论断" — explicit ontological neutrality
2. **范畴论与境 opening:** Author offers three interpretations:
   - Structure IS essence
   - Structure REPRESENTS essence  
   - Both together
   Author explicitly declines to choose, saying only that *in practice* we can only access structure.
3. **K1策略:** "这里的稳定结构仅仅是描述性的...是否具有某种形而上意义...在此我们并未得出结论"

**Resolution:** Framework **brackets** rather than forecloses ontological claims.

**Consensus:** 9/9 advisors agree

**Implication for Translation:** The 道德仁義禮 analysis describes *order of knowing* (how we epistemically acquire concepts) while leaving *order of being* (what's metaphysically prior) open. Translators should preserve this ambiguity; footnotes may note the explicit three-interpretation framework from the opening.

**Kantian Note:** This parallels Kant's distinction between empirical realism (phenomena are real for us) and transcendental ideality (we make no claims about things in themselves). The framework describes phenomenal reality of concepts without foreclosing noumenal questions.
