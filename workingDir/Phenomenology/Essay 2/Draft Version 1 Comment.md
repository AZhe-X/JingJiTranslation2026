## Overall Assessment: **Good**

The minimal apparatus approach is correct for an author-composed English essay. The single TN effectively bridges to the collection's technical vocabulary without over-explaining.

---

## Translator's Note Evaluation

The TN does three things well:

1. **Links "phenomena" to 现象**: Readers encountering the collection in order will recognize the term; readers starting here get the Chinese term for cross-reference.

2. **Provides the minimal definition**: "What we experience or observe, the indubitable ground of all cognition" — accurate and not over-freighted.

3. **Forward-references "First Reality"**: Flags that this essay lays epistemological groundwork without spoiling later developments.

## Phenomenological Observation

The essay's core move — the "access argument" that truth is only available *through* phenomena — parallels Husserl's Principle of All Principles: originary givenness is the ultimate legitimizing source. The author arrives at this independently through practical epistemological analysis.

The author's sidenote on "Phenomena" ("what we experience or observe") already provides basic clarification. The TN complements rather than duplicates this by linking to the collection's framework.

---

## Recommendations

- **No changes needed to the TN.**
- The author's own sidenotes and acknowledgement should be preserved exactly (as they are).
- Consider whether the abstract (authored by Claude, per acknowledgement) should have any note — but this seems unnecessary; the acknowledgement is transparent.

---

## Summary

The minimal apparatus is appropriate. The essay speaks for itself in English; the TN provides just enough scaffolding to situate it within the collection. Ready for finalization.
