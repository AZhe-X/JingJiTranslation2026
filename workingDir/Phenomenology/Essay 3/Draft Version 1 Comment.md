## Overall Assessment: **Good**

The translation preserves the essay's exploratory, conversational tone and captures the phenomenological insight at its core: meaning is lived, not sought.

## Phenomenological Observations

### The Cat Example as Philosophical Experiment

The essay builds to a crucial phenomenological point: in cat-raising, absurdity "never even arrives." This is not recovery of meaning (Sisyphus's revolt), not reframing (entrepreneur), but meaning that simply *is*, pre-reflectively, without needing articulation.

This parallels Merleau-Ponty's motor intentionality — engaged, embodied activity where meaning is lived rather than thematized. The translation preserves this by keeping the experiential texture: "we naturally feel satisfaction in the process of raising a cat."

TN2 correctly flags this philosophical significance: the cat example *dissolves* the Camusian problematic rather than resolving it.

### Key Term Choices

1. **"Immanent meaning" (内生的意义)**: Excellent. "Immanent" captures internal-generation without the voluntaristic overtones of "self-generated" or "self-created." Philosophically precise.

2. **"Dissonance" (非和谐)**: The author's own "off-tone" is preserved immediately after. Both terms work — "dissonance" is more standard, "off-tone" is the author's coinage. Good handling.

3. **"Alienation" (异化)**: Correct. The pivot from Camus to Marx is philosophically significant — absurdity arises when labor's meaning is externalized.

4. **"Transcendence" / "transcendent" (超越/超越性)**: Used correctly for the external/outward direction of meaning-seeking. The author's negative usage (transcendence as what we cannot reach) is preserved.

### Title

"Sisyphus, Work, and the Cat" — TN1 explains 班 well. "Work" captures the mundane, non-heroic quality that makes the contrast with Sisyphus's mythic labor effective.

## Minor Observations

1. **"Fulfilled, happy"** — The original "绝望而充实幸福" is rendered "both desperate and fulfilled, happy." The comma between "fulfilled" and "happy" slightly separates what the Chinese treats as a compound (充实幸福). Consider: "desperate yet fulfilled and happy" or simply "desperate and fulfilled"? Minor stylistic point; current rendering is acceptable.

2. **The Bob example from Essay 2 resonates here** — in Essay 2, Bob sees "light, loss, grief" rather than rain. In Essay 3, the cat-owner sees care and satisfaction rather than Sisyphean labor. Same structure: what shows itself depends on the experiential horizon.

## Recommendations

- **No content changes needed.**
- Both TNs are appropriate — neither over-explains.
- The exploratory tone ("But wait. What if we look at it differently?") is well-preserved.

---

## Summary

The translation captures the essay's core phenomenological move: absurdity is an artifact of misdirected intentionality (seeking meaning externally), and meaning lived immanently dissolves the problem entirely. The cat-raising example is preserved as a philosophical experiment that demonstrates rather than argues. Ready for editor review.
