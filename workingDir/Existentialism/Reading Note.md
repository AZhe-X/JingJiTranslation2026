# Reading Notes — 境集

## Second Reading: Revisions and New Observations

### On the Sisyphus/Cat Essay (Essay 3)

**First-read criticism:** The cat example is too quiet; what about unchosen suffering?

**Second-read revision:** The author explicitly addresses alienation (异化) as the source of absurdity — "工作的意义被外化了." This is Marxist-existentialist terminology. The essay is more socially aware than I credited.

More importantly: the cat example shows meaning that is *neither* internal (self-conscious project) *nor* external (cosmic). It's pre-reflective engagement — "甚至我们都不需要明确的依靠理性把这个意义提出." This challenges Sartre's emphasis on the conscious *project* as source of meaning. Closer to Merleau-Ponty's motor intentionality or Heidegger's ready-to-hand.

**Remaining question:** Is this a *solution* to absurdism or a *redescription*? Camus might say: avoiding the question isn't dissolving the condition.

### On the Poetic (Essay 5)

**First-read criticism:** Is the poetic just aesthetic? What about tragedy?

**Second-read revision:** The author is clear: the poetic requires "全身心之投入" (whole-hearted engagement). This isn't Kierkegaard's aesthetic stage (detached play). It's closer to the religious — commitment despite/through knowing groundlessness.

Key passage: "有一些梦境是我们无法选择的已然存在的" — unchosen dreamscapes exist. The author acknowledges this but doesn't fully develop what the poetic stance means for traumatic or oppressive unchosen structures.

Footnote 2's distinction between stimulus-feeling and crystallized-feeling is phenomenologically sophisticated — close to Husserl's hyle/noesis distinction.

### On K1 Strategy (Essay 7)

**First-read criticism:** The formalism gap; what counts as verification in philosophy?

**Second-read revision:** The author is explicit that the framework is "描述性的" (descriptive), not normative. This is intellectually honest — not claiming to solve the normative question.

The game analogy for natural transformations is excellent: alignment is tested through operational results. For math: verification. For games: winning. But for philosophy? The author leaves this open.

The language structure/meaning solution is sophisticated: neither structure-first nor meaning-first but *alignment* (natural transformation exists). This transcends the structuralism/mentalism debate.

### On Death (Appendix)

**First-read criticism:** Bracketing death may bracket what makes existentialism existential.

**Second-read revision:** The author isn't simply avoiding death but making an argument against Heidegger: "向死而生" is always "向自己所以为的死而生" — being-toward-one's-conception-of-death. This conception is shaped by metaphysics, so being-toward-death doesn't escape metaphysics.

This is contestable (Heidegger would say death is a possibility, not a concept) but philosophically substantive. The author offers an alternative: self-propulsion through 境-construction, exemplified by the coin-flip ritual — from indecisive self, through constructed structure, to self-knowing self.

### Overall Revision

The collection is more philosophically rigorous than first reading suggested. Key revisions:
1. The author engages with alienation, not just individual meaning
2. The "poetic" is not aesthetic detachment but knowing commitment
3. The framework is explicitly descriptive, not normative
4. The death-bracket is argued, not merely assumed
5. The category theory is offered as *one tool among many*, not the privileged method

**Remaining gaps:**
- The normative question (should we pursue stable structures?) is acknowledged but unaddressed
- Unchosen traumatic 境 get mentioned but not developed
- The intersubjective dimension needs more work
- The "problem list" in the appendix may overclaim

## First Reading Notes

## 1. 关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一

**Date written:** 2021-01-31

### Summary
The essay asks: does "collective interest" genuinely exist, or does it reduce to individual interests? Initial skepticism gives way to a resolution via the concept of *renormalization* (重整化) — borrowed from physics. Just as macro-level phenomena (ocean waves) emerge from micro-level dynamics (water molecules), collective interest is *well-defined* at the macro scale even though it doesn't exist as an entity at the micro scale.

### Key Moves

1. **The reduction objection:** Collective interest seems to dissolve into the interests of individuals composing the collective.

2. **The renormalization response:** Macro-level concepts are *effective existents* (有效存在). The question is not whether a collective entity exists objectively, but whether *at the macro level, a group can be cognized as a whole*.

3. **The individual as epistemological ground:** Human beings can only understand from their individual standpoint — we lack the "structural basis" of society itself. We cannot know others' true thoughts; we can only *attempt* understanding from our embodied individual position.

4. **Empathy's condition:** Precisely *because* we are individuals, empathy is possible. If we were the collective itself, we would be as indifferent to individual suffering as we are to our cells' "joys and sorrows."

5. **Law as trans-individual:** Legal systems operate on individuals but produce macro-level effects — like temperature affecting water. This is the domain where collective interest becomes well-defined.

6. **Abstraction as renormalization:** The essay ends by suggesting that abstract concepts generally may be understood as results of renormalization — scale-dependent emergent phenomena that are nonetheless *real* and *cognizable*.

### Existentialist Resonances

- **Radical individuality:** The insistence that understanding must proceed from and return to the individual echoes Kierkegaard's "the single individual" and Heidegger's Dasein as essentially mine (Jemeinigkeit).

- **Facticity and embodiment:** "Human beings cannot stand on anything that transcends themselves" — the footnote's clarification that transcendence is only defined by standing on oneself resonates with Sartrean facticity (we transcend *from* our situation, not *despite* it).

- **Being-for-others:** The acknowledgment that we can never truly know another's thoughts, only attempt understanding from our own position, parallels Sartre's analysis of the Other as fundamentally alien yet co-constitutive.

- **Individual as locus of meaning:** The second footnote — that even when acting for others' benefit, this returns to my interest (my purpose, my care) — echoes existentialist accounts of commitment. De Beauvoir: "I concern myself with such and such an objective... only to the degree that it involves my being."

### Questions / Tensions

- The renormalization framework is *descriptive* — it says macro phenomena are real. But can it ground *normativity*? Can we move from "collective interest is well-defined" to "collective interest should sometimes override individual interest"? The essay brackets this.

- The physics metaphor may naturalize what existentialists treat as distinctively human. For Sartre, human relations are not just emergent patterns but structured by freedom and reciprocal recognition. Does renormalization flatten this?

- Interesting absence: no mention of *conflict* between individual and collective, or of alienation, bad faith, the They (das Man). The essay is ontological, not yet critical.

## 8. 关于诗意和境的一些零散想法 (Scattered Thoughts on the Poetic and Jìng)

**Date written:** 2025-07-19 (modified 2026-02-01)

### Summary
Appendix collecting supplementary reflections on the framework. Includes: defense of human finitude as creative rather than tragic; analogies (ICAC vs. Censorate, coin-flipping as poetic); notes on death, category theory as tool, and an attempted summary of philosophical problems addressed by the framework.

### Key Themes

**Human limitation as creative possibility:**
- The inability to access "objective reality" is not tragedy
- Like novels are limited to language — but this limitation enables unique psychological effects, cross-temporal resonance
- Imprecise perception enables color displays (RGB), twelve-tone equal temperament
- "How could this be, and why would this be, a tragedy?"

**Post-metaphysics as structural reform:**
- Pre-metaphysics = Censorate (御史台) — depends on Emperor to function
- Post-metaphysics = ICAC (廉政公署) — functions through structural position
- The latter is more effective and can evolve

**The poetic in everyday practices:**
- Coin-flipping for decisions: You must genuinely believe you'll follow the result for it to reveal your preference. This is poetic engagement — lucid but committed.
- "Book of Answers": Creating a question-answer context that generates insight
- Self-fulfilling prophecy as 境-construction

**On death:**
- Death is transcendent to the self — we cannot access our own death
- "Being-toward-death" is always being-toward-*one's-conception*-of-death, shaped by metaphysics
- Therefore: we cannot care about life's purpose (purpose lies outside life), only about life's process and the feelings it generates
- Self-propulsion: from current self, through practice, construct new self — but this is neither absolute nor necessary

**Category theory as one tool among many:**
- The author emphasizes this is a personal choice, not the only or best tool
- Other tools: logic, poetic imagery, scientific theory, aesthetics
- All tools enable description and construction of 境
- Art, journalism, games, memes, interior decoration, choosing clothes — all are 境-construction

**Philosophical problems addressed (author's claim):**
- Collective interest definition
- Knowledge definition
- Absurdism
- Kantian questions
- Existentialism
- Definition of human (practically)
- Ship of Theseus
- Objectification/alienation
- Language: meaning vs. structure priority
- What is understanding?
- What do we understand?
- Meno's paradox
- What is "awakening" in Eastern philosophy?
- How philosophy can be operational
- Intersubjectivity

### Existentialist Resonances

- **The affirmation of finitude:** The author's defense of human limitation echoes Heidegger's insistence that finitude is not a defect but constitutive of human existence. Also Nietzsche's amor fati — loving one's condition rather than lamenting it.

- **Death and transcendence:** The claim that one's own death is "transcendent" and thus inaccessible echoes Heidegger's analysis of death as the "possibility of the impossibility of existence." But the author draws a different conclusion: not "being-toward-death" but focus on *process* and *feeling*.

- **Self-creation:** The notion of constructing new selves through practice resonates with Sartre's radical freedom and de Beauvoir's ethics of ambiguity — we are not given but make ourselves, without guarantees.

- **The poetic in everyday life:** The coin-flipping example is striking. It shows how the "poetic" stance (lucid but committed engagement with constructed meaning) operates in mundane decisions. This is existentialism made practical.

### Questions / Tensions

- **The lightness:** The author treats limitation and groundlessness with remarkable equanimity. "How could this be a tragedy?" But Kierkegaard's anxiety, Heidegger's uncanniness, Sartre's nausea — these are responses to the same situation with different affect. Is the author's lightness a form of the poetic, or a bypassing of existential weight?

- **Death bracket:** The author brackets death, saying we can't "care about life's purpose." But isn't confrontation with death precisely what opens authentic existence in Heidegger? Bracketing death may bracket what makes existentialism existential.

- **The problem list:** The author claims to have "addressed" a long list of philosophical problems. This is ambitious. Has the framework really *solved* these, or provided a *perspective* on them? The distinction matters for translation.

## 7. 范畴论与境：K1策略 (Category Theory and Jìng: K1 Strategy)

**Date written:** 2025-07-15 (modified 2026-02-01)

### Summary
Develops the K1 strategy for using category theory to study the evolution of 境 (experiential structure). Introduces evolution functors (how 境 changes over time) and conversion functors (between language, math, knowledge, and raw experience). The central innovation: "understanding" is formally defined as the existence of a *natural transformation* between external structure evolution and internal experiential evolution. Proposes methods for empirical "philosophical experiments" by evoking experiences through structured stimuli.

### Key Framework

**Functors defined:**
- $T_t: \mathbb{E}_t \to \mathbb{E}_{t+1}$ — evolution functor, how 境 changes over time
- $(F_{E,L})_t: (\mathcal{E}_L)_t \to \mathbb{E}_t$ — embedding language into experience
- $(F_{L \to K})_t: (\mathcal{E}_L)_t \to (\mathcal{E}_K)_t$ — language to knowledge

**Stable structures:**
- $S_E$ — stable structure preserved through evolution of $\mathbb{E}$
- $S_L$ — stable structure in language (grammar, syntax)
- The stable structures in sub-categories can help access $S_E$ via functors

**Natural transformation and understanding:**
- Two paths from math-structure to later experience:
  1. Math → Experience → Evolved Experience
  2. Math → Evolved Math → Experience
- If a natural transformation exists between these paths, understanding occurs
- The component $\eta_a$ is the feeling of "confirmation" or "getting it"
- When $\eta_a$ is identity: immediate recognition, no mediation needed — "mastery"

### The Definition of "Understanding"

The author's key claim: When you understand something, you've established a natural transformation between:
- The evolution of the external structure (language, math, phenomenon)
- The evolution of your internal experience

Example: Reading "The cat jumped on the table"
- Sentence structure unfolds according to grammar
- Your mental simulation unfolds (cat moves, leaps, lands)
- When these align, you feel you "understand"
- The feeling of understanding is not about accessing the "thing itself" but about achieving *alignment* ($\eta$)

When alignment fails (e.g., nonsense sentence), no natural transformation, no understanding-feeling.

### K1 Strategy Methods

1. **Cross-domain research:** Use well-formalized categories (language, math) to study hard-to-access ones (experience) via functors
2. **Categorical interpretation:** Read category-theoretic results as philosophical claims
3. **Philosophical experiments:** Elements in $\mathbb{E}$ are experiences, accessible via introspection. Design stimuli that produce specific structural positions → verify the structure
4. **Population comparison:** Test which structures can be evoked in which populations → reveals cognitive development, cultural conditioning

### On "Prior" Cognitive Structures

- If $\mathbb{E}_{t_c}$ is the minimal 境 (earliest moment), its stable structure might be "innate"
- If a structure is necessary for *any* $\mathbb{E}$ to be constructed from $\mathfrak{P}$, it could be called "cognitive structure"
- The author remains agnostic about ontological status — this is descriptive, not metaphysical

### Existentialist Resonances

- **Heidegger's understanding:** The definition of understanding as structural alignment echoes Heidegger's hermeneutic account — we understand when something fits within our pre-understanding. The "natural transformation" is a formal rendering of the hermeneutic circle.

- **Sartre's pre-reflective consciousness:** The author's claim that understanding is about structural position, not accessing "the thing itself," parallels Sartre's rejection of a substantial self. There's no inner kernel to access, only relational structure.

- **Merleau-Ponty's body schema:** The example of reading a sentence while "simulating" the action in mind echoes Merleau-Ponty's motor intentionality — understanding involves embodied simulation, not just abstract cognition.

- **Existential verification:** The proposal to verify philosophical claims through "philosophical experiments" — evoking experiences through structured stimuli — is a phenomenological method. Husserl's "eidetic variation" in formal dress.

- **Kierkegaard's indirect communication:** The final section notes that poetry, art, games, memes all do what category theory formalizes — construct structures to evoke experiences. This is Kierkegaard's indirect communication: you can't transmit existential truth directly, only create conditions for the reader's own realization.

### Questions / Tensions

- **The formalism gap:** Natural transformations are mathematically precise; experience is not. How confident can we be that the formalism captures what it claims? The author admits this is "descriptive modeling" — but models can be wrong.

- **What counts as "alignment"?** The feeling η is crucial, but how do we distinguish genuine alignment from illusory alignment (thinking you understand when you don't)?

- **Normativity:** The author explicitly brackets normative questions — whether we *should* seek stable structures, whether "understanding" is good. But existentialists might press: is the desire for structural alignment itself a form of flight from the uncanny (Unheimlichkeit)?

- **The "T" (completion/closure):** The author introduces a feeling of "completion" when a terminal object is reached. But existentialists are suspicious of closure — Heidegger's authentic Dasein is "being-toward-death," not being-toward-completion. Is the pursuit of T a form of bad faith?

## 6. 范畴论与境 整理 (Category Theory and Jìng, Organized)

**Date written:** Draft organized version

### Summary
A formal treatment of the author's metaphysical framework using category theory. Argues that structure (external relations) constitutes or reveals essence (internal nature), justifying a structural approach to thought. Introduces 境 (jìng, here meaning "dreamscape" or "enclosed experiential structure") as a category-theoretic structure on phenomena. Key insight: concepts/metaphysical abstractions are *universal properties* in subcategories of this structure.

### Key Framework

**Why category theory?**
- To study thought as "concepts linked in some form"
- Structure (external relationships) reveals/constitutes essence
- In practice, any investigation of "internal essence" converts to examining "external extensions" — like defining a word using other words
- We can only transcend a given domain by studying its evolution (how things *enter* thought)

**Basic category theory:**
- *Category*: objects + morphisms (with identity, composition, associativity)
- *Universal property*: initial or terminal object in a (sub)category

**P and E:**
- $\mathfrak{P}$ = phenomena, the "first reality," totality of feeling/experience
- $\mathcal{E}$ = a category structure *on* $\mathfrak{P}$
  - Objects: selected parts of P (feelings)
  - Morphisms: associations (also feelings, hence also objects)
- Because morphisms are also objects, $\mathcal{E}$ has a *tower structure*

**Tower structure (塔式结构):**
- Construction method where morphisms at level n become objects at level n+1
- Meta-order: the level at which an object appears in a tower construction
- Absolute meta-order vs. relative meta-order (relative to a "cornerstone")

**Metaphysics (形而上) defined:**
- A *metaphysical abstraction* m is an association in $\mathcal{E}$ that is a universal property in some subcategory $\mathcal{E}_m$
- E.g., "pen" is the feeling evoked when seeing any pen-like object — it's the terminal object in the subcategory containing pencils, fountain pens, etc.
- This is *descriptive*, not *prescriptive*: $\mathcal{E}$ exists prior to any particular construction

**A metaphysics (形而上学):**
- = a *construction* on $\mathcal{E}$
- = a way of assigning meta-orders to objects
- Top-down (自上而下): cornerstone = universal property (e.g., Dao generates all)
- Bottom-up (自下而上): cornerstone = concrete phenomena, abstracting upward to universals

### Examples Analyzed

**Ship of Theseus:** The "essence" of the ship = the feeling evoked when anything ship-related is mentioned. If we mistakenly take P = physical world and morphisms = containment, we get paradoxes. Correctly: P = phenomena, morphisms = associations.

**What is a human?** "Human" = the feeling when seeing/thinking of humans. To elaborate, explore lower meta-order objects in the subcategory (hands, faces, sociality, etc.).

**Objectification:** When a worker sees their product, it activates "I" — the product enters the subcategory with "I" as universal property.

**Dragon's blood:** Illustrates that meta-order is relative to a construction, not intrinsic. For John (alchemist), human/dragon/blood are same level. For Luke (before rebellion), human-blood and dragon are same level, dragon-blood is higher (inferred). After rebellion, all equalize. $\mathcal{E}$ itself doesn't fix meta-orders.

### Existentialist Resonances

- **Heidegger's hermeneutic circle:** The claim that understanding "internal essence" always converts to "external relations" parallels Heidegger's insight that we understand beings within a totality of involvements. Being is always being-in-context.

- **Sartre's concept of the self:** The definition of "I" as a universal property — the feeling evoked by all I-related things — resonates with Sartre's pre-reflective cogito as not a substance but a way of relating.

- **Dasein's thrown projection:** The distinction between the "static" structure of $\mathcal{E}$ and the "dynamic" study of how things enter thought parallels Heidegger's thrownness (we find ourselves already in a meaning-structure) and projection (we relate to our possibilities).

- **Objectification/alienation:** The category-theoretic treatment of how products become part of "I" connects to Marxist-existentialist analysis of labor. The author's framework allows for articulating both authentic self-extension and alienation.

- **Anti-essentialism:** The claim that "essences" are just universal properties in experience-categories, not mind-independent forms, is compatible with existentialist rejection of fixed human nature.

### Questions / Tensions

- **Formalism and lived experience:** The category-theoretic apparatus is elegant but risks distancing us from the phenomenological texture of experience. Can associations really be formalized as morphisms?

- **What determines the category?** $\mathcal{E}$ is said to be a structure "on" P that we "choose" to describe categorically. But what guides the choice? The author says we "select" objects and morphisms, but doesn't say what constrains selection.

- **Tower structure and infinite regress:** If morphisms are objects, and we can always take morphisms between morphisms, do we get infinite hierarchy? The author acknowledges this but doesn't resolve whether $\mathcal{E}$ is $T_n$ for some finite n or $T_\infty$.

- **Relation to the "poetic":** The previous essay introduced the poetic as the appropriate stance toward meaning. How does category-theoretic formalization serve the poetic? Is it a tool for achieving lucidity?

## 5. 形而上学后的目的：诗意 (The Purpose After Metaphysics: The Poetic)

**Date written:** 2022-07-02

### Summary
Continues from the post-metaphysics essay to address meaning and purpose. Introduces the concept of *dreamscape* (梦境) as the "environment" in which meaning exists. Distinguishes between *intoxicated* dreamscapes (beliefs taken as ultimate) and *lucid/wakeful* dreamscapes (the *poetic* — knowing you're in a dreamscape while fully engaging). Argues that post-metaphysical existence must be "poetic" — neither denying meaning nor falling into naïve belief.

### Key Concepts

**Dreamscape (梦境):**
- Any "environment" in which meaning/experience exists
- Games, stories, rituals, beliefs — all are dreamscapes
- Wide sense: any context that makes feeling possible

**Meaning/Purpose = Feeling/Experience:**
- "两面一体" (two sides of one body)
- The purpose of a game is the experience it provides
- Meaning is not rational insight but "感性的涌动、体验的结晶、情绪的湍流" — sensory surge, crystallization of experience, emotional turbulence

**Two modes of dreamscape:**
1. **Intoxicated (沉醉的):** Belief, faith. We don't know we're in a dreamscape. The dreamscape's purpose becomes the logical starting point — "ultimate reality," unmoved mover.
2. **Lucid/Wakeful (清醒的):** The *poetic* (诗意). We know we're dreaming, know meaning exists *within* this environment. But this doesn't mean disengagement — lucid dreamscapes still require "全身心之投入" (whole-hearted engagement).

**Why we cannot abandon dreamscapes:**
- We *already* have feeling as constitutive of being the "I" that we are
- Feeling precedes the concept of "I"
- To abandon all dreamscapes would be to abandon all feeling — possible only at death
- Denial of meaning is "虚妄" (empty arrogance)

**The poetic as post-metaphysical stance:**
- Cannot deny meaning (feeling exists)
- Cannot be intoxicated (ultimate reality is disenchanted)
- Remaining path: treat meaning/dreamscape *as what it is* — lucid engagement
- This is 诗意, the poetic

### Existentialist Resonances

- **Camus' lucidity:** The "lucid" consciousness that Camus valorizes — aware of absurdity yet living anyway — is structurally similar to the author's 清醒. But the author seems more affirmative: not revolt but *engagement*.

- **Nietzsche's life-affirming illusions:** Nietzsche (especially in *Birth of Tragedy*) argues we need the "Apollonian illusion" to endure existence. The dreamscape concept is similar — structures that make meaning possible — but the author doesn't use the language of illusion; dreamscapes are "environments," not falsifications.

- **Sartre's fundamental project:** The notion that feeling/purpose precedes the concept of "I" and that we're thrown into meaning-structures parallels Sartre's analysis of pre-reflective consciousness and the fundamental project we find ourselves already pursuing.

- **Heidegger's poetic dwelling:** "Poetically man dwells" (Hölderlin via Heidegger). The author's use of 诗意 as the appropriate stance post-metaphysics echoes later Heidegger's turn toward poetry as the site where being is disclosed without metaphysical pretension.

- **Kierkegaard's aesthetics/ethics/religion:** The distinction between intoxicated and lucid dreamscapes might map onto Kierkegaard's stages — the aesthetic lives unreflectively in immediacy, the ethical commits to frameworks, the religious... The author doesn't develop this, but the structure invites comparison.

### Questions / Tensions

- **Is the poetic just aesthetic?** The term 诗意 risks reducing post-metaphysical existence to an aesthetic mode. The author says engagement must be "全身心" but doesn't address ethical/political dimensions. Can we have lucid engagement with injustice?

- **Games as paradigm:** Using games as the primary example is illuminating but potentially limiting. Games have clear boundaries; life's dreamscapes interpenetrate. Can we be lucid when the dreamscape is "being human" itself?

- **Feeling precedes concept of I:** This is stated but not argued. It's a strong phenomenological claim. What kind of "I" exists pre-conceptually? How does it have feelings?

- **The impossibility of total disengagement:** The author claims we *cannot* abandon all dreamscapes. But depressive anhedonia, dissociative states, certain meditative absorptions — don't these approximate the condition the author calls impossible?

## 4. 后形而上学 整理 (Post-Metaphysics, Organized)

**Date written:** 2025-07-24 (modified 2026-02-01)

### Summary
A systematic treatment of metaphysics organized around the author's distinction between "pre-metaphysics" (traditional metaphysics seeking ultimate reality), nihilism (the collapse of ultimate values), and "post-metaphysics" (a metaphysics that acknowledges all metaphysical concepts are constructed from phenomena). The essay develops a hierarchy of metaphysical abstraction and argues that the *direction* of generation is inverted in our understanding — we think Dao generates virtue generates ren generates li, when in fact we abstract from observed li upward to posit Dao.

### Key Framework

**Terminology:**
- *Phenomena* (现象) = what we "have" directly, the "first reality" (第一实在)
- *Second reality* (第二实在) = the constructed "objective world" — our interpretation of phenomena
- *Pre-metaphysics* = metaphysics before nihilism, seeking ultimate reality
- *Post-metaphysics* = metaphysics after nihilism, acknowledging construction

**Types of metaphysical abstraction (形而上):**
- **Type 0:** Basic recognition of constancy — the same apple persists, abstract "apple" concept
- **Type 1:** Predictive generalization — apple trees will bear fruit again
- **Type 2:** Conceptual abstraction — from repeated honesty to "integrity" as concept
- **Type 3:** Combination of abstractions — frameworks, values, formalization

### Key Moves

1. **The inversion:** Using the Daodejing's progression (Dao → De → Ren → Yi → Li), the author shows that the *actual* order of generation is reversed: we observe 现象礼 (phenomenal propriety), interpret it via 现象义 and 现象仁, generalize to 德, then posit 道. But we *understand* it as Dao generating everything downward. The original phenomenal grounding is "lost" (失).

2. **Phenomena as first reality:** We cannot go "below" phenomena. Even if a "true" objective world exists (第〇实在), we can only access it *as* phenomena. When we posit ultimate reality, what we posit becomes second reality.

3. **Nihilism as absence:** Nihilism isn't a produced "ism" — it's the void left when "highest values" collapse. It's *lack*, not assertion.

4. **The non-rational (非理性):** The pursuit of ultimate reality is non-rational. Reason's purpose lies outside reason (analytic judgment: a destination can't be itself). Our pursuit of constancy (恒常) is a non-rational need — without it we have no "grip" on phenomena, no meaningful action. This non-rationality must be *acknowledged*.

5. **Self-realization:** The deeper purpose behind our pursuit of constancy is "self-realization" (自我实现) — making the ideal overlap with phenomena, seeing ourselves in the world, confirming our existence.

6. **Post-metaphysics:** After nihilism, metaphysics continues but with changed understanding:
   - "Ultimate reality" (第〇实在) loses special status
   - *Phenomena* gains the central position
   - All metaphysics is explicitly recognized as modeling/describing phenomena
   - The non-rational is acknowledged
   - Practice (实践) = overlap of ideal and phenomena, becomes the core

### Existentialist Resonances

- **Phenomenological foundation:** The insistence on phenomena as "first reality" parallels Husserl's "back to the things themselves," though the author uses this term more loosely (closer to everyday phenomena than Husserlian intentional objects).

- **Nietzsche's shadow:** The analysis of nihilism as "loss of highest values" and the emphasis on the *non-rational* basis of value-seeking echoes Nietzsche. The "death of God" is here recast as the collapse of the pre-metaphysical edifice.

- **Kierkegaard and the non-rational:** The acknowledgment that reason's purpose lies outside reason, and that our existential situation requires embracing the non-rational, resonates with Kierkegaard's leap and his critique of Hegelian rationalism.

- **Heidegger's ontological difference:** The author's distinction between the order of *being* and the order of *understanding* (we understand Dao as first but it's derived) parallels Heidegger's insistence that beings appear within a prior understanding of Being, and that metaphysics forgets this.

- **Sartre and self-realization:** The notion that we seek to see ourselves in phenomena, to realize ourselves, echoes Sartre's consciousness as "nihilating" the in-itself to project its own meaning.

- **Authenticity:** Post-metaphysics as accepting our constructive role, owning the non-rational, is a form of philosophical authenticity — no longer hiding behind "ultimate reality."

### Questions / Tensions

- **Is this still metaphysics?** The author calls it "post-metaphysics," but one could argue it dissolves metaphysics into epistemology and phenomenology. What metaphysical claims remain?

- **The non-rational:** The author insists we must "acknowledge" (承认) the non-rational. But what kind of acknowledgment? Practical acceptance? Theoretical endorsement? The status of the non-rational is underspecified.

- **Practice (实践):** Introduced as the "great way" (大道) but not developed here. The essay points to the next piece for elaboration.

- **Constancy (恒常):** The author identifies this as the core of metaphysics — our need for repeatability, predictability. But is this a psychological need or an ontological structure? Both? The essay slides between levels.

## 3. 西西弗斯、班与猫 (Sisyphus, Work, and Cats)

**Date written:** 2025-06-06

### Summary
A response to Camus' absurdism. The author argues that the absurd arises from *asking the wrong question* — seeking meaning externally (from the cosmos) when meaning is generated internally. When we stop looking outward, absurdity dissolves. The essay moves through three examples: Sisyphus, the alienated office worker, and cat ownership — each revealing that meaning needn't be "transcendent" to be real.

### Key Moves

1. **Diagnosing the absurd:** Absurdity is the "off-tone" between a person seeking cosmic meaning and the cosmos's silence. But this is asking the wrong question — like searching for your watch in places you've never been when you left it at home.

2. **The office worker example:** A worker becomes disillusioned, asking "what's the meaning of work?" But if he were doing what *he* wants (entrepreneurship), the question wouldn't arise. The source of absurdity is *alienation* — working for external purposes.

3. **Sisyphus reinterpreted:** Camus says Sisyphus is happy in revolt. The author agrees but clarifies: revolt is itself an *internal* meaning. Sisyphus regenerates purpose from within, even though it's directed against the external ("transcendent").

4. **The cat example:** Caring for a cat is repetitive, demanding, even Sisyphean — yet *no one* feels absurd about it. Why? Because the meaning is simply intrinsic: we want to, we enjoy it, nothing more. No cosmic justification needed, no dramatic revolt required.

5. **Conclusion:** Transcendence (cosmic or otherwise) isn't necessary for meaning. Meaning can be simply internal, non-dramatic, non-defiant. Absurdity dissolves not through revolt but through reorientation.

### Existentialist Resonances

- **Direct engagement with Camus:** The essay is in conversation with *The Myth of Sisyphus*. The author doesn't reject Camus outright but suggests the absurdist framing perpetuates an unnecessary orientation toward the external.

- **Echoes of Heidegger:** The critique of "asking the wrong question" is Heideggerian in spirit. The absurd arises from a deficient mode of questioning — like ontic questions that miss the ontological.

- **Sartre's freedom and project:** The distinction between alienated work and authentic pursuit echoes Sartre's notion of the project. When we freely choose our ends, the question of external meaning doesn't arise.

- **Beyond revolt:** The cat example subtly challenges the Camusian emphasis on revolt. This is meaning without defiance, without even articulation — just lived engagement.

### Questions / Tensions

- **Is this too quiet?** Camus would likely say the cosmic indifference still matters — even if we generate meaning internally, the universe's silence remains a *condition*. The author seems to dissolve this rather than address it.

- **What about imposed suffering?** Cat ownership is chosen. What about unchosen conditions? Is the author's solution available to those in truly Sisyphean situations (oppression, illness)?

- **Alienation:** The essay introduces the concept but doesn't develop it. Is all external purpose alienating, or only coerced external purpose? The entrepreneur still works for customers, society.

- **The cat as limit case:** Interestingly, the cat example resists philosophical elaboration. The author says we "don't need to rationally articulate" the meaning. Is this a feature or a limit? Existentialists often distrust unreflective contentment.

## 2. A Thought on Knowledge

**Date written:** June 12, 2025

### Summary
A critique of the classical definition of knowledge as "justified true belief." The author systematically examines each component and argues that in *practice*, we never access truth directly — only phenomena. Justification ultimately rests on belief (or circularly on other beliefs). Conclusion: what we call "knowledge" functions as "what each individual believes to be correct."

### Key Moves

1. **Belief is subjective:** Intrinsically irrelevant to "objective truth." The connection to truth is *extrinsic*.

2. **We access phenomena, not truth:** The rain example — we look outside but only obtain the *phenomenon* of potential rain (we might be deceived by a fancy sprinkler). We cannot check beliefs against truth directly.

3. **The truth condition is "methodologically impossible":** We cannot verify knowledge by comparing it to truth.

4. **Justification's starting points:** Must be justified belief, phenomena, or truth. But:
   - Truth isn't directly accessible in practice
   - Phenomena must be "digested" into thought (belief) to be used
   - So justification reduces to belief about belief

5. **The trilemma:** Knowledge is either circularly justified, grounded in unjustified belief, or involves infinite regress. Circular and infinite options are problematic. This suggests "knowledge" is just... belief.

6. **Pragmatic conclusion:** In practice, the useful concept is "what each individual believes to be correct" — extendable to "what most people in a field believe to be correct."

### Existentialist Resonances

- **Phenomenological method:** The author's move — bracketing truth and examining what we actually *experience* and *do* — mirrors Husserl's epoché, though without the technical apparatus. Focus on phenomena as the starting point.

- **The individual as epistemological ground:** "Knowledge" resolves to individual belief. This resonates with the existentialist insistence that the individual is the site of all meaning and understanding. Compare the first essay's claim that we can only understand from our individual standpoint.

- **No view from nowhere:** The impossibility of checking beliefs against truth directly parallels Nietzsche's perspectivism and Sartre's rejection of a "God's-eye view."

- **Facticity of our epistemic situation:** We are *thrown* into our epistemic condition — we work with beliefs, phenomena, habits of justification. We cannot step outside.

- **Authenticity vs. bad faith:** Interesting implication — if knowledge is belief, then claiming to *know* (in the strong sense) might be a form of bad faith? Owning one's beliefs *as* beliefs could be more authentic.

### Questions / Tensions

- The author sidesteps metaphysical debates about truth deliberately. But does this pragmatic approach concede too much to relativism? The author gestures toward "standards" (e.g., scientific ones) that prioritize phenomena — but standards are themselves beliefs.

- There's no existential *anxiety* in this account. Knowledge collapses to belief, but this is presented almost calmly. Where's the vertigo of groundlessness that Kierkegaard or Heidegger would emphasize?

- The sidenotes on physics and mathematics are interesting — showing that even "hard" sciences operate via phenomena and belief. This is Kuhnian in spirit (paradigms as beliefs), though the author doesn't cite Kuhn.
