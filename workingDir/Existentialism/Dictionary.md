# Translation Dictionary: Existentialist/Absurdist/Nihilist Terms

## 荒谬
- **Main translation**: absurdity / the absurd
- **Alternatives**:
  - "the ludicrous" (when emphasizing the colloquial sense of ridiculousness)
  - "absurdism" (when referring to the philosophical position)
- **Note**: In the Chinese term, 荒 (wild, desolate) + 谬 (error, falsehood) carries a stronger connotation of incorrectness and ridiculousness than Camus's French *absurde*, which has a more neutral, technical quality describing structural mismatch. However, this colloquial weight actually serves the author's argument: the absurd IS ridiculous because it represents a category error—seeking meaning externally when meaning is internally generated. The author's dissolution of absurdity through the cat-raising example fundamentally reframes Camus's confrontational stance, arguing that absurdity never had genuine ontological status but was merely an artifact of misdirected intentionality (向外寻求意义).

## 虚无
- **Main translation**: the void / nothingness
- **Alternatives**:
  - "nihility" (when emphasizing the state of being)
  - "emptiness" (when Daoist/Buddhist resonances are prominent)
  - "the nothing" (Heideggerian contexts)
- **Note**: This term is far richer than English "nothingness." 虚 (empty, void, insubstantial) resonates with Buddhist *śūnyatā* (空), while 无 (nothing, non-being) evokes the Daoist 无 that precedes 有 (being) in cosmogony. Together they create a term that is simultaneously negative (absence) and cosmologically resonant (the productive void). Unlike Nietzsche's *Nihilismus*, which carries historical and psychological weight from European Christianity and Platonism, 虚无 has Daoist associations with the fertile void from which things emerge. The author uses this term to describe what remains after the collapse of metaphysical frameworks—not as a new edifice but as the absence itself, the empty sky above the rubble.

## 虚无主义
- **Main translation**: nihilism
- **Alternatives**:
  - "the condition of nihility" (when emphasizing it as a state rather than doctrine)
  - "the void-stance" (when distinguishing from Western historical nihilism)
- **Note**: The author makes a crucial distinction: nihilism is not a doctrine (主义 as "ism") but an absence (缺位, vacancy). "Nihilism is not a kind of having, not an -ism, but a kind of absence... it's just that nothing was produced or created anymore, and there is nothing here." This maps onto Nietzsche's "devaluation of the highest values" (*Entwertung der obersten Werthe*) but arrives through structural rather than historical analysis. Where Nietzsche traces nihilism through Christianity and the ascetic ideal, the author shows why nihilism must occur given the structure of human cognition: all 形而上 (metaphysical constructs) are generated upward from phenomena but we mistake them as generating phenomena downward. When this inversion is recognized, the edifice collapses—not because of cultural forces but because of inherent cognitive structure.

## 诗意
- **Main translation**: the poetic / poetic dwelling
- **Alternatives**:
  - "poetic meaning" (literal but less evocative)
  - "*shiyi*" (left untranslated, like *Dasein*)
  - "poetic stance" (when emphasizing the existential dimension)
- **Note**: This is the author's central positive contribution and the most challenging translation term. English "poetic" connotes aesthetic ornamentation, but 诗意 is an entire existential stance—a way of being in the world post-nihilism. It functions like Heidegger's *Dichtung* (poetry/poiesis) as world-disclosing activity, not mere versification. The poetic is characterized by lucid engagement with dreamscapes (清醒的梦境): one knows the meaning-structure is not grounded in ultimate reality, yet engages with it fully. This differs from Nietzsche's voluntaristic *amor fati*, Camus's heroic revolt, and Heidegger's quietistic *Gelassenheit*—it is active but not heroic, aware but not detached, constructive but not delusional. It is the most livable post-nihilistic philosophy, sustainable as everyday practice (like raising a cat) rather than requiring philosophical heroism.

## 梦境
- **Main translation**: dreamscape
- **Alternatives**:
  - "dream-realm" (emphasizing spatial quality)
  - "experiential environment" (when technical clarity is needed)
  - "meaning-world" (when emphasizing the semantic dimension)
- **Note**: 境 (boundary, realm, environment) gives this term a spatial/environmental quality that "dream" alone lacks. The author explicitly states this is not just nocturnal dreaming but any meaning-environment where experience unfolds—game-worlds, narrative-worlds, ritual-spaces, life-projects. The dreamscape is where meaning and feeling become "two sides of one body" (两面一体). Crucially, dreamscapes can be either intoxicated (沉醉, unaware that it's a dreamscape) or lucid (清醒, aware yet fully engaged). This maps onto the existentialist problematic of authenticity/bad faith but reframes it: the issue is not moral failing but epistemological stance toward one's own meaning-structures.

## 清醒
- **Main translation**: lucid / lucidity
- **Alternatives**:
  - "awakened" (when Buddhist resonances are relevant)
  - "clear-headed" (colloquial contexts)
  - "aware" (when emphasizing consciousness)
- **Note**: In the context of 清醒的梦境 (lucid dreamscape), this term deliberately evokes lucid dreaming—knowing you are dreaming while remaining in the dream and able to act within it. This is the author's version of authenticity: one knows one is in a dreamscape, knows the meaning-structure is not grounded in ultimate reality, yet engages with it fully. This resolves the perennial existentialist problem: how can one be both fully aware of contingency and fully committed to one's projects? The author's answer: one plays the game knowing it is a game, like engaging with a novel or performing a ritual. The lucid stance is contrasted with both沉醉 (intoxicated/unreflective engagement) and detachment—it requires wholehearted investment to obtain the core experience.

## 沉醉
- **Main translation**: intoxicated / intoxication
- **Alternatives**:
  - "immersed" (less pejorative contexts)
  - "entranced" (emphasizing lack of critical distance)
  - "absorbed unreflectively" (when clarity is needed)
- **Note**: In 沉醉的梦境 (intoxicated dreamscape), one does not realize one is in a dreamscape. The dreamscape's purpose becomes the unquestioned logical origin—the unmoved mover. This corresponds to Sartre's *mauvaise foi* (bad faith) and the "spirit of seriousness" (*esprit de sérieux*)—treating contingent values as though they were given, necessary, and grounded in something absolute. However, the author is more generous than Sartre: intoxication is not a moral failing but the natural pre-nihilistic stance. Before nihilism, we had no reason to suspect we were in a dreamscape. This is closer to Heidegger's *das Man* (the "they")—not culpable but a structural feature of average everydayness. The author calls intoxicated stances 信念 (belief) or 信仰 (faith).

## 超越
- **Main translation**: transcendence / to transcend
- **Alternatives**:
  - "going-beyond" (when emphasizing the movement)
  - "surpass" (in comparative contexts)
  - "exceed" (when boundaries are involved)
- **Note**: The author uses 超越 in multiple senses: (a) existential transcendence—going beyond the self (Sartre's *transcendance*); (b) metaphysical transcendence—going beyond phenomena to ultimate reality; (c) the quality of goals that reach outward beyond one's immanent experience. The cat-raising example is crucial: it has "no transcendence whatsoever" (没有超越性)—no one asks about the meaning of cat-raising because the meaning is entirely immanent to the activity. By contrast, entrepreneurial goals, even when internally generated, still have transcendent dimensions (reaching toward external outcomes). This distinction maps onto the difference between absorbed engagement (*Zuhandenheit*) and reflective pursuit of external goals.

## 超越性
- **Main translation**: transcendence / transcendent quality
- **Alternatives**:
  - "transcendent character" (when emphasizing the property)
  - "outward-reaching dimension" (when contrasting with immanence)
- **Note**: The substantive form emphasizes the quality or property of transcending. Most important philosophically: the author argues that one's own death is transcendent (超越性) to oneself—therefore it is impossible to "live toward death" (向死而生) as Heidegger proposes. The death one lives toward is always one's own conception of death, shaped by one's metaphysical framework. This is a sharp critique of *Sein-zum-Tode* (Being-toward-death): Heidegger's privileging of death as the source of authenticity is itself an intoxicated dreamscape—it smuggles in a metaphysical valuation of death not warranted by phenomenological evidence. The implication: we cannot actively care about the purpose of life (because the purpose is not within life), therefore we can only care about the process of life and the feelings the process brings.

## 意义
- **Main translation**: meaning / significance
- **Alternatives**:
  - "significance" (when emphasizing weight or importance)
  - "sense" (when emphasizing intelligibility)
  - "purpose" (when teleological dimension is primary)
- **Note**: Central to the author's argument is that meaning and feeling are "two sides of one body" (两面一体)—meaning IS the felt experience. This challenges intellectualist accounts of meaning (meaning as conceptual content) in favor of an experiential account (meaning as structured feeling). The author argues: "I boldly surmise that meaning and purpose are in fact the surging of sensibility, the crystallization of experience, the turbulence of emotion—purpose and meaning are essentially experience and feeling." This connects to the phenomenological tradition (particularly Heidegger's *Befindlichkeit*, attunement) but is more radical: meaning cannot be separated from affect. The attempt to seek meaning externally (向外寻求意义) is the category error that generates absurdity. Meaning is internally generated (内在的意义) through engagement with dreamscapes.

## 存在
- **Main translation**: existence / being
- **Alternatives**:
  - "Being" (when Heideggerian *Sein* is relevant)
  - "existence" (when emphasizing individual existence, *Existenz*)
  - "to exist" (verbal form)
- **Note**: In the Chinese philosophical tradition, 存在 carries less ontological weight than Western "Being" but more concreteness than abstract "existence." The author's framework shifts attention from the question of Being (*Seinsfrage*) to the structure of experiential fields (境). This reflects the post-metaphysical stance: the question "Why is there something rather than nothing?" is itself a form of externalized meaning-seeking. The author's focus is on 已然存在 (already-existing)—"I, as an already-existing I, necessarily have feelings that belong to me as me." This prioritizes facticity and thrownness over ontological speculation. Existence is treated as the given starting point (第一实在, First Reality = phenomena) from which all metaphysical constructs are generated, rather than as something requiring metaphysical ground.

## 自由
- **Main translation**: freedom
- **Alternatives**:
  - "liberty" (political contexts)
  - "free" (adjectival/verbal forms)
- **Note**: While not extensively theorized in the essays read, freedom in the author's framework relates to the capacity to construct dreamscapes (境) and choose which dreamscapes to inhabit. This differs from Sartre's radical freedom (we are "condemned to be free") in that the author acknowledges we cannot abandon ALL dreamscapes—"I, as an already-existing I, necessarily have feelings that belong to me as me." Some dreamscapes are unavoidable (已然存在的). Freedom is therefore not absolute but operates within the constraint of our already-existing affective structure. The coin-flip example illustrates freedom as self-transformation through境-construction: constructing a dreamscape (chance-as-decision) to move from a self trapped in indecision to a self that knows what it wants. Freedom is practical and processual—"from the self back to the self" (从自己回到自己).

## 选择
- **Main translation**: choice
- **Alternatives**:
  - "to choose" (verbal)
  - "decision" (when emphasizing the act)
  - "selection" (when emphasizing options)
- **Note**: Related to freedom and境-construction. The author emphasizes that some dreamscapes are unavoidable (we cannot choose to have no feelings) while others are延续的 (continuable through choice). Choice is not the Kierkegaardian either/or that defines existence, nor Sartre's anguished confrontation with total responsibility. Instead, choice is embedded in the practical activity of境-construction and境-navigation. The coin-flip example shows choice as a process of self-discovery: we construct a decision-mechanism (the境 of chance) to reveal what we already want. This is choice not as ex nihilo creation but as excavation of already-existing preference through境-mediated practice.

## 死亡
- **Main translation**: death
- **Alternatives**: None (straightforward term)
- **Note**: Brief but philosophically crucial treatment. The author argues: "One's own death is transcendent (超越性) to oneself. Therefore it is impossible to 'live toward death' (向死而生)." This directly challenges Heidegger's *Sein-zum-Tode* (Being-toward-death) as the fundamental structure of authentic existence. For Heidegger, confronting the possibility of my own impossibility individualizes me from *das Man* and throws me back upon my ownmost potentiality-for-Being. The author's objection: this "death" is always already a metaphysical construct (形而上)—death-as-understood, shaped by one's metaphysical framework, not death itself. Different frameworks produce different conceptions of death and different forms of "Being-toward-death," none of which access death as such. Implication: Heidegger's privileging of death as the source of authenticity is itself an intoxicated dreamscape (沉醉的梦境). Conclusion: "We cannot actively care about the purpose of life (because the purpose is not within life), therefore we can only care about the process of life, the feelings that the process brings." This shifts from teleological to processual existentialism.

## 恒常
- **Main translation**: constancy / the constant
- **Alternatives**:
  - "permanence" (when emphasizing duration)
  - "invariance" (technical/mathematical contexts)
  - "the unchanging" (when contrasting with change)
- **Note**: Central to the author's account of metaphysics. "The core of the metaphysical is *constancy* (恒常)." We seek constancy in changing phenomena so we can meaningfully act. 恒常 provides "assurance" (保证): that the same phenomena will repeat. This maps onto traditional metaphysical categories of identity and causality (the author notes "causality is temporal identity, so they are essentially the same thing"). The progressive development of metaphysics (道→德→仁→义→礼) is a "retreat" (步步后退) from pursuit of ultimate reality toward pragmatic utility because the sought-for "ultimate reality" proves unreachable. When we recognize that metaphysical constructs are generated upward from phenomena (not downward from ultimate reality), the edifice collapses into nihilism. Post-nihilism, we recognize恒常 as constructed through境 rather than discovered in ultimate reality.

## 境
- **Main translation**: *jing* (untranslated) / experiential field / meaning-environment
- **Alternatives**:
  - "境-realm" (when emphasizing spatial quality)
  - "境-structure" (when emphasizing formal properties)
  - "境" (romanized, like *Dasein*)
- **Note**: This is the master term of the entire philosophical collection. 境 means boundary, realm, state, condition, environment. The author uses it to denote the structured experiential field in which meaning arises. It has no single English equivalent. Given the term's centrality and conceptual uniqueness, recommend leaving it untranslated (romanized as *jing*) throughout translation, with extensive introduction explaining: 境 is where meaning and feeling coincide as "two sides of one body," where experience unfolds, where metaphysical constructs (形而上) become operative. 境 can be lucid (清醒的境) or intoxicated (沉醉的境). We construct境 through practice, navigate among境, and cannot escape境 entirely because "I, as already-existing, necessarily have feelings." The formal/category-theoretic work treats境 as structured objects with morphisms between them, making this concept mathematically precise in ways unprecedented in existential philosophy.

## 感受
- **Main translation**: feeling / felt experience
- **Alternatives**:
  - "sensation" (when emphasizing sensory input)
  - "affective experience" (when theoretical precision is needed)
  - "sense" (verbal: to feel/sense)
- **Note**: The author distinguishes two senses: (1) received information, sensory stimulation; (2) the "crystallization," "surging," "turbulence" that these sensations arrive at and constitute. Both are感受. Crucially: "feeling precedes the concept of self" (感受是在我之概念之先前就已然存在的). This establishes the priority of affect over cognition, experience over concept. Feeling and meaning are "two sides of one body" (感受和意义即是两面一体)—meaning IS felt experience. This prevents the radical nihilist move of rejecting all meaning, because we cannot reject all feeling as long as we exist. The attempt to do so is虚妄 (delusional and arrogant). This echoes Heidegger's *Befindlichkeit* (attunement, how one finds oneself) as more primordial than cognition, but the author makes affect constitutive of meaning itself rather than merely disclosive of Being.

## 非理性
- **Main translation**: non-rational / the non-rational
- **Alternatives**:
  - "irrational" (when emphasizing opposition to reason)
  - "arational" (when emphasizing independence from reason)
  - "extra-rational" (when emphasizing what exceeds reason)
- **Note**: Critical concept. "Reason's purpose must necessarily lie outside reason, so reason's purpose must necessarily be non-rational—that is to say, reason exists only as a tool." Therefore: "The pursuit of ultimate reality is itself non-rational (metaphysics itself is non-rational)." The author argues this non-rationality should be **acknowledged** (承认), not condemned. The non-rational pursuit of constancy (恒常) is what enables meaningful practice—the overlap between ideal and phenomenon that allows self-realization. Deeper still: "I think there is another layer beyond the pursuit of constancy: we need this 'practice.' This overlap between ideal and phenomenon is 'self-realization'—we see ourselves in phenomena, verify my existence, make phenomena become 'part of me.'" This acknowledgment of the non-rational is central to post-metaphysical stance: we proceed knowing our meaning-construction is not rationally grounded in ultimate reality, yet we construct and engage anyway.

## 我
- **Main translation**: I / the self / the I
- **Alternatives**:
  - "self" (when emphasizing personal identity)
  - "ego" (psychoanalytic contexts)
  - "the subject" (when emphasizing epistemological role)
- **Note**: Used phenomenologically rather than substantively. The author emphasizes "I, as an already-existing I" (我作为已然存在的我)—the self as always already thrown into affective experience, not as a transcendental ego or Cartesian cogito. The self is constituted through境: "from the self back to the self" (从自己回到自己) describes境-construction as a process of self-transformation and self-propulsion. The coin-flip example: moving from a self trapped in indecision to a self that knows what it wants through construction of a境. This is processual selfhood, constantly evolving through practice rather than fixed substance. Echoes Nietzsche's anti-essentialist view of the self and Heidegger's Dasein as always ahead-of-itself, but without Nietzsche's will-to-power or Heidegger's Being-toward-death as organizing principles.

## 异化
- **Main translation**: alienation
- **Alternatives**:
  - "estrangement" (emphasizing subjective experience)
  - "reification" (when objects/processes become thing-like)
- **Note**: Used explicitly to reinterpret Camus's absurdity. The office worker feels absurd because his labor is alienated (异化)—he works for external purposes, not his own. "When the source of meaning is externalized (外化), the off-tone appears. When it is internalized, it vanishes 'as if it had never come.'" This connects Camus's cosmic absurdity directly to Marx's concept of alienation, making absurdity not a fundamental feature of the human condition but a symptom of alienated labor/life. The entrepreneur does not feel absurd because her goals are internally generated. The cat-raiser goes further—no transcendent goals at all, just immanent engagement. This Marxist analysis of absurdity is philosophically significant: it suggests the existentialist problematic itself arises from specific socio-economic conditions (alienated labor) rather than from the human condition as such.

## 反叛
- **Main translation**: revolt / rebellion
- **Alternatives**:
  - "rebellion" (when emphasizing active resistance)
  - "defiance" (when emphasizing attitude)
- **Note**: References Camus's *révolte* in *The Myth of Sisyphus*. For Camus, revolt is "the constant confrontation between man and his own obscurity"—the heroic refusal to accept the absurd leads to happiness. The author reinterprets: "Rebellion against the absurd is itself an internal goal (内在的意义), which is why it works. But it is unnecessarily dramatic." Camusian revolt already accomplishes what the author's诗意 aims at (internally generated meaning) but through dramatic confrontation rather than simple engagement. The cat-raiser has gone beyond revolt because there is nothing to revolt against—absurdity never had the occasion to arise. Revolt is thus revealed as one form of internally generated meaning, effective but more strenuous than necessary. The author's position: 诗意 is post-revolt in the same way it is post-nihilistic—it dissolves rather than confronts.

## 形而上学
- **Main translation**: metaphysics
- **Alternatives**: None (standard philosophical term)
- **Note**: The author makes a crucial structural argument: metaphysics is generated **upward from phenomena** (自现象而产生), not downward from ultimate reality. The Chinese 形而上学 (study of what is above form) etymologically suggests metaphysics generates form, but the author inverts this: "形而上 (the metaphysical) is in fact generated from form." All metaphysical constructs are abstractions and generalizations from phenomena, but we mistakenly understand them as generating phenomena. Example: 道→德→仁→义→礼 appears to flow downward (Dao generates all), but actually flows upward (concrete ritual behaviors are abstracted into仁, generalized into德, ultimately producing the concept of道). When this inversion is recognized, the metaphysical edifice collapses (虚无主义). The author distinguishes: **前形而上学** (pre-metaphysics, traditional/classical metaphysics before nihilism) pursues ultimate reality; **后形而上学** (post-metaphysics, after nihilism) recognizes all metaphysics as constructed from phenomena and returns metaphysics to practice. The author's post-metaphysical stance: formalize metaphysics as境-construction, acknowledge its non-rational basis, make it serve the overlap between ideal and phenomenon.
