## Topic #10 — 道德仁義禮 Inversion

**Question:** Does the author's analysis (禮→仁/義→德→道 as epistemological order) foreclose Confucian ontological claims about 仁's priority, or merely bracket them?

**Opening:** Chinese Philosophy raised concern that reducing 仁 to structural position might miss the Confucian claim that 仁 is ontologically constitutive of humanity, not merely a projection from observed 禮.

**Key debate:** Metaphysics argued that defining metaphysical concepts as universal properties (terminal objects in subcategories) is itself an ontological commitment — if structural position exhausts what something IS, nothing remains for an "ontologically prior 仁" to be.

**Resolution:** Metaphysics withdrew concern after re-reading the 范畴论与境 opening, which explicitly offers three interpretations:
1. Structure IS essence
2. Structure REPRESENTS essence  
3. Both together

The author declines to choose, saying only that *in practice* we can access structure. This confirms the framework **brackets** rather than **forecloses** ontological claims.

**Consensus:** 9/9 advisors agree the question is resolved. The framework permits Confucian ontological claims about 仁's priority alongside the epistemological analysis of concept-formation.

**Translation implication:** Translator can present the 道德仁義禮 passage as epistemological analysis without implying it refutes Confucian metaphysics.

## Topic #3 — η as Understanding: Criterion or Redescription?

**Question:** Does structural alignment (η) provide a genuine *criterion* for understanding, or merely *redescribe* what we already do when we say "I understand"?

**Opening:** Wittgenstein argued η provides genuine criterion, not mere redescription, for two reasons:
1. The naturality condition (η commutes with all morphisms) is a structural constraint, not a subjective feeling — private content drops out, structural role remains (beetle-in-the-box move)
2. The criterion is verified by practice: whether subsequent operations succeed — the feeling confirms alignment, practice tests correctness

**Key debate:** Does relocating the criterion to structural alignment + practical success satisfy the demand, or merely relocate the problem (now needing a criterion for "successful practice")?

**Resolution:** Cross-tradition convergence that the relocation is resolution, not regress:
- **Existentialism:** Practice is self-validating; failure is self-announcing (breakdown, Angst, tool becomes conspicuous)
- **Buddhism:** Arthakriyā (causal efficacy) — concept validated by whether it enables successful action
- **Phenomenology:** Erfüllung (fulfillment) — intention meets intuition in lived verification
- **Wittgenstein:** "Going on" — understanding shown in continuation, not introspection

**Consensus:** The apparent regress dissolves because practical failure is self-announcing across multiple traditions. η provides genuine criterion verified through practice.

**Translation implication:** The η-mechanism can be presented as substantive epistemological contribution, not mere terminological innovation.
