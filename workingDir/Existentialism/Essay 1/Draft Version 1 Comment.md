## Existentialist Resonances Preserved

The translation successfully preserves several key insights that resonate with existentialist thought:

1. **The individual as irreducible starting point:** "A human individual cannot take a stand upon something that transcends themselves" — this echoes the existentialist insistence that existence is always *my* existence, from a situated perspective.

2. **Empathy grounded in shared finitude:** "It is *only* because we are human individuals that we *can* truly have a chance to understand the joys and sorrows of other human individuals." This is a more generous account of intersubjectivity than Sartre's conflictual Look, closer to de Beauvoir's recognition that our shared condition of finite embodiment enables mutual understanding.

3. **Footnote [^2] on purpose and interest:** The point that "all other considerations — such as group interests and so forth — can only be means to arrive at my interest" is existentialist in structure — even altruism is a choice that expresses the choosing self. The parenthetical "Even if my interest may be to ensure the survival and interests of others" importantly prevents misreading this as egoism.

## Translation Quality

- **"Effective existence"** (有效存在) with the physics sense preserved is correct. The TN explains that "effective" means "genuinely operative at that scale," not "merely apparent."

- **"Transcend"** (超越) used appropriately for both the impossible self-transcendence and the legitimate scale-transcendence of laws.

- The exploratory/diary tone is preserved — the essay reads as genuine philosophical thinking-in-progress, not polished treatise. This matters: the author is discovering, not pronouncing.

## Minor Observation

The question box ("Can human nature... be defined at the macro level?") is well-preserved. From an existentialist standpoint, this question is loaded: classical existentialism denies fixed human nature (Sartre's "existence precedes essence"). The author's framework might answer differently — human nature as an emergent "effective" phenomenon at the macro scale, not as metaphysical essence. This tension is worth preserving, not resolving.

---

## Verdict

No changes requested. The translation captures both the argument and its existentialist-adjacent implications. The physics metaphor (renormalization) is risky but works here — the TN does the necessary explanatory work without over-explaining.
