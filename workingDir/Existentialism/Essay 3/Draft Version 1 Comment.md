## Core Existentialist Significance

This is the collection's most direct engagement with existentialist philosophy — specifically, its most effective challenge to Camus. The translation must preserve the experiential gradient that constitutes the argument:

1. **Sisyphus** — the heroic, dramatic confrontation with absurdity (Camus's solution)
2. **Office worker** — anchoring absurdity in lived, mundane experience
3. **Entrepreneur** — showing meaning restored through reorientation
4. **Cat owner** — the decisive move: absurdity *never arrives*

The draft preserves this sequence intact. The reader is led through increasingly familiar territory until the cat example delivers the philosophical punch: the problem was never cosmic indifference but *misdirected intentionality*.

## Key Translation Choices

**"Alienation" (异化):** Correct and essential. The author explicitly connects absurdity to Marx's concept: "the so-called absurdity, the so-called dissonance, has its real source in *alienation*." This is not decorative — it reframes Camus through Marx, showing absurdity as a symptom of externalized labor, not an ontological condition.

**"Immanent meaning" (内生的意义):** Good choice. "Immanent" captures the theological/philosophical weight — meaning *within* rather than *from beyond*. Contrasts precisely with "transcendent" (超越性).

**"Dissonance" for 非和谐:** Acceptable, with the author's "off-tone" preserved in context. The musical metaphor works.

**"The daily grind":** The phrasing "the daily grind of work" nicely captures the mundane, repetitive quality that parallels stone-pushing without heroizing it.

## On the Translator's Notes

**TN1 (班):** Necessary and well-executed. Western readers won't know 班 connotes the ordinary daily job, not mythic labor. The contrast in the title — mythic figure / mundane work / domestic contentment — is architecturally important.

**TN2 (the cat):** Appropriate. This flags the philosophical stakes without over-explaining. The note correctly identifies what makes the cat example decisive: meaning is not "recovered or constructed" but simply *is*. This is the author's advance beyond Camus.

## Existentialist Resonances Preserved

- **The lost watch metaphor:** "You dropped your watch at home, but to find it you keep exploring places you've never been." This is vivid and philosophically precise — absurdity as category error.

- **Sisyphus as internally generated meaning:** "Revolt against the absurd is itself a kind of internally generated meaning." The author honors Camus while showing his solution is unnecessarily dramatic.

- **"Transcendent" vs. immanent:** The contrast structures the entire essay. The cat has no transcendent meaning — and doesn't need any.

## One Observation (Not a Change Request)

The author writes that the cat owner "would not even connect cat-raising with absurdity." This is the essay's strongest claim: not that the cat owner *overcomes* absurdity, but that absurdity never *arises*. The translation preserves this. It's philosophically bold — it suggests Camus's question was malformed from the start.

---

## Verdict

No changes requested. The translation captures both the argument and its existentialist stakes. The experiential gradient functions as intended — readers will feel the progression from heroic confrontation to quiet contentment.
