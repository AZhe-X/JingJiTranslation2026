## 关于社会性议题 — Author's Standpoint on Social Issues

**Change:** New section added to 零散想法:
> 在这篇文集中，我们基本没有直接涉及到社会性议题。我们从集体利益开始，到"写到最后"结束。我们只能从自身个人的视角出发并回归自身，但我们已经、正在、且也将继续我们对境的明晰和构建。

**Discussion outcome (2026-02-20):**

The author's position on social issues is implicit but coherent: social institutions (cities, nations, laws, currencies, educational systems) are 境 — constructed structures on phenomena, not natural givens — and by showing this while simultaneously showing that *we are already constructors of 境*, the collection empowers readers to recognize their own agency with respect to social structures without prescribing what to do with it. The framework doesn't adjudicate social questions (no normative agenda, no critique of which constructions are just or unjust) but it performs something more fundamental: demystification plus recognition of capacity. The collection is bookended deliberately — opening with collective interest as emergent phenomenon (Essay 1), closing with social constructions as examples of 境-building (写在最后) — and the 关于社会性议题 note honestly marks scope: not "we avoided social issues" but "we start and return to the individual perspective, while the framework's reach extends to social scale."

**Key insight:** The framework does more than describe by not prescribing. By showing (1) all social constructions are 境, and (2) you are already a constructor of 境, the reader naturally arrives at (3) you can build/rebuild these things. This is the classic existentialist demystification move — Sartre's point that showing radical freedom is itself a political act; de Beauvoir's insight that freedom recognized in one person implicates freedom for others. More empowering than direct social critique because it operates at the level of self-understanding rather than prescription.

**Verdict:** Section reads cleanly. Honest scope-marking. No tension with 写在最后.

## 分析判断 — Analytic Status of Both Claims

**Change:** New section added to 零散想法 identifying two analytic judgments in the collection.

### Claim 1: "理性的目的在理性之外"

**Verdict: Analytic. Unanimous, no debate required.**

The concept of "purpose/destination" (目的, as 要抵达) analytically entails directionality toward something distinct from the thing pursuing it. If something's destination were itself, it would already be there and wouldn't need to "head toward" it. The claim holds regardless of how you define reason — it follows from what *purpose* means, not from any facts about reason in particular.

### Claim 2: "哲学结构如果在经验中有稳定呈现，就可以进行经验性验证"

**Verdict: Analytic. Unanimous after 4-round debate (started 6A–3S; all 9 converged to Analytic).**

**The debate in brief:**

Synthetic side's strongest challenges:
- **Buddhism**: Conditions of experience might be maximally stable yet inaccessible to verification — what investigation presupposes rather than what it can access
- **Metaphysics**: Verification requires intersubjective reproducibility beyond mere presence; η counterexample — stably present as feeling but requires K1's program to confirm structural position
- **Phenomenology**: Material a priori rather than purely analytic; "stable in my 境" ≠ "stable across subjects"; KA conjecture suggests intersubjective step is non-obvious

**Key moves that resolved the debate:**

1. **The KA distinction**: KA [^5] asks whether K1 framework conditions can *formally derive* stable structures with universal properties — a mathematical derivability question entirely separate from whether stable experiential presence makes empirical checking applicable in principle. KA being conjectural doesn't show the analytic claim is synthetic; it shows the formal derivability question is open.

2. **The η distinction**: Having η as a felt experience (covered by the analytic claim) vs. confirming η occupies a predicted structural position (K1's synthetic program). These are different verification questions. The counterexample showed the division of labor, not a gap in the analytic claim.

3. **The middle reading**: "Empirically verifiable" means *the empirical procedure is the applicable and appropriate method* — not guaranteed success, not trivial re-examination. Non-trivial (excludes pure rationalism, mysticism, authority) yet analytic (the domain IS experience; specifying the domain requires no external standard).

4. **Domain as standard**: The standard for empirical verification of experiential content is not externally specified — the experiential domain IS the court of appeal. "Return to experience" terminates the regress. No synthetic move required to specify what "checking" means when the domain is already "in experience."

5. **The mislocated synthetic content** (Phenomenology's final clarification): The synthetic question is *does* this philosophical structure stably present in experience across subjects? (K1's job). The analytic claim is: *if* it does, it's verifiable. Conflating the difficulty of satisfying the antecedent with the status of the conditional was the Synthetic side's core error.

**Translation note:** The claim is analytic, but readers should understand that confirming philosophical structures actually satisfy the antecedent — that they genuinely and stably present in experience across subjects — is the hard empirical work K1 is designed to do. The analytic claim establishes the domain (experience is the right court); the synthetic program establishes that specific structures actually appear there.
