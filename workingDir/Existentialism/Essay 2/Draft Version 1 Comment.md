## On the Translator's Note

The TN correctly situates "phenomena" within the collection's technical vocabulary. This is necessary because readers encountering this essay first (following collection order) need to understand that "phenomena" here carries the full weight it will bear in later essays — not merely "appearances" but the indubitable ground of all cognition, what the author will call "First Reality."

The note is appropriately minimal. Over-apparatus would intrude on an essay the author chose to write in English.

## Existentialist Resonances (No Additional Apparatus Needed)

The essay's existentialist dimensions don't require flagging — they'll become visible through juxtaposition with later essays:

1. **The practical/lived focus:** "In practice (in real life)" appears repeatedly. The author refuses to discuss knowledge abstractly, insisting on how justification actually works for embodied, situated individuals. This is phenomenological method applied to epistemology.

2. **The deflationary conclusion:** "Knowledge is just... belief?" — this isn't nihilism but reorientation. It moves the question from "what is knowledge?" to "what do we actually do when we claim to know?" The existentialist will recognize this as bracketing metaphysical pretensions to focus on existence.

3. **The digestion point:** The Alice/Bob examples show that phenomena must be "converted into thoughts" — there's an active, interpretive moment. This anticipates the framework's insistence that meaning is constructed, not received.

4. **The individual as locus:** "What each individual believes to be correct" — the ground of epistemology is the existing individual, not abstract rationality.

## Assessment

The apparatus is sufficient. The essay works as groundwork — its existentialist implications emerge through the collection's arc, not through annotation here.

No changes requested.
