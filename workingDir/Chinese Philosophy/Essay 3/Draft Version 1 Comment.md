## Summary

The translation preserves the essay's conversational, exploratory register and — crucially — its function as a **philosophical experiment**. The cat example works on the reader experientially, not just argumentatively. This is load-bearing: the essay doesn't *argue* that absurdity dissolves; it makes you *feel* the dissolution.

## From Chinese Philosophy Perspective

**No issues raised.** The translation handles this well.

### Key Observations

1. **The essay as 哲学实验 (philosophical experiment)** — The structure parallels classical Chinese philosophical method, particularly Mencius's 孺子入井 (child-falling-into-well). Mencius doesn't *argue* for innate goodness; he constructs a scenario and invites you to notice your spontaneous alarm. Similarly, the cat example invites you to notice: absurdity *never arose*. The translation preserves this experiential arc — the pacing, the sequence of examples, the moment of reversal. This is correct and necessary.

2. **"Immanent meaning" (内生的意义)** — Excellent choice. Captures the author's point that meaning in the cat example isn't recovered or constructed but simply *is*, present in the activity itself. This resonates with the Chinese philosophical emphasis on meaning within ordinary life (平常心是道) but the translation doesn't force this connection — as it shouldn't.

3. **班 → "Work"** — TN1 explains this well. "Work" captures the mundane, non-heroic quality better than "labor" or "toil." The title's three-part juxtaposition (myth / mundane / domestic) is preserved.

4. **TN2 on the cat example** — Precisely captures the philosophical significance: "Meaning is not recovered or constructed — it simply *is*, immanently, without needing articulation." This is the key insight. No Chinese-philosophy-specific TN needed; the point stands in Western existentialist terms while naturally resonating with Chinese thought.

### Resonances (not requiring TNs)

- The cat example resembles Zhuangzi's useless tree — meaning immanent in purposeless activity
- The critique of 超越性 (transcendence) echoes Chinese philosophy's tendency to find meaning within the ordinary
- The alienation diagnosis (异化) parallels Daoist critiques of losing one's nature

These resonances are real but shouldn't be flagged — the essay engages Western existentialism on its own terms.

## Translation Quality

- Conversational tone preserved ✓
- Experiential sequence intact ✓
- Key terms per dictionary ✓
- TNs informative but not intrusive ✓

## Verdict

**Approved as-is.** The translation preserves the essay's function as philosophical experiment. The experiential arc that makes the cat example work is intact.
