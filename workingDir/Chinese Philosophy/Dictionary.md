# Translation Dictionary for Chinese Philosophical Terms

**Translator's Note**: This dictionary addresses the most critical challenge in translating the 境集 corpus: the author uses traditional Chinese philosophical vocabulary in ways that both evoke and radically depart from tradition. Every term carries a double burden—its traditional resonance and the author's specific reinterpretation. The translator must preserve both dimensions.

---

## 境 (jìng)

- **Main translation**: **Jing** (romanized, with glosses)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "Experiential Realm" (most descriptive)
  - "Realm" (when brevity needed, with initial explanation)
  - "Scape" (captures constructive/perspectival quality)
  - "Domain" (too mathematical, avoid)
- **Note**: This is the author's central concept. In Buddhist tradition, 境 translates Sanskrit *visaya* (sense-object domain) or *gocara* (field of activity). In Yogacara philosophy, it refers to the object-realm arising in relation to consciousness. In Daoist usage, it appears in compounds like 仙境 (immortal realm) and 意境 (artistic conception). The author's usage is FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT: 境 is formally defined as **a category-theoretic structure on phenomena (P)**—specifically, a category E where selected experiences become objects and associations (联想) between them become morphisms. This has three defining features: (1) built on 现象/感受 (phenomena/felt experience), (2) possesses formal structure (a category with tower structure), (3) evolves dynamically (via functors T_t). The author explicitly considers alternative names: "游戏、书、冒险、小世界、小自在" (game, book, adventure, small world, small freedom). DANGER: Do not collapse this back into traditional Buddhist 境界 (spiritual attainment level) or aesthetic 意境. This is a technical term for the organized totality of how experiences relate to one another. The closest traditional resonance is 境界 in its most general sense ("the world as experienced from a particular standpoint"), but the author has mathematically formalized it. Translation strategy: Use "Jing" consistently with extensive initial apparatus explaining the term, or use "Experiential Realm" throughout with reminder that this is a structured, evolving, constructed domain.

---

## 境界 (jìngjiè)

- **Main translation**: **"Realm"** or **"Experiential realm"**
- **Alternatives**: "Domain," "Sphere," "Level of attainment" (Buddhist contexts)
- **Note**: Traditional compound meaning "domain/sphere/realm" or "level of spiritual attainment" (Buddhist). In Chinese aesthetics and philosophy, 境界 often refers to the sphere of understanding or attainment one has reached. The author uses this more loosely than 境 proper. When the author writes "思想的境界" (the realm of thought), this refers to the boundaries/limits/scope of thought, not the technical category-theoretic structure. Distinguished from the technical term 境 (Jing). Context will clarify whether traditional or technical usage is intended.

---

## 道 (dào)

- **Main translation**: **"the Way"** (traditional contexts); **"Dao"** (when emphasizing the concept itself)
- **Alternatives**: "the Path," "Dao/Tao"
- **Note**: One of the most loaded terms in Chinese philosophy. In Daoist tradition (Laozi, Zhuangzi), 道 is the ultimate source, the ineffable cosmic principle from which all things flow. "道可道,非常道" (The Way that can be spoken is not the eternal Way). In Confucian contexts, 道 is the moral Way, the path of virtue. The author's RADICAL REINTERPRETATION: 道 is **the ultimate abstraction constructed LAST through progressive generalization from phenomena**, not the primordial source given first. In the reversal argument (后形而上学), the author shows: 礼→义→仁→德→道 is the actual construction order, even though the conceptual presentation reverses it as 道→德→仁→义→礼. This is genuinely original—no classical Chinese philosopher has argued that 道 itself is a cognitive construction built from phenomenal observation upward. The translator MUST signal this inversion. In the category theory formalization, 道 appears in two different meta-order tuples: Top-down {(道,0)...} where 道 is initial object, vs. Bottom-up {(道,5)...} where 道 is terminal object produced last. Use "the Way" for resonance, but add translator's notes making clear that for this author, the Way is PRODUCED through abstraction, not ontologically prior.

---

## 德 (dé)

- **Main translation**: **"De"** (romanized) or **"inherent character"**
- **Alternatives**: "Virtue" (Confucian contexts only), "Power/potency" (Daoist contexts), "Nature"
- **Note**: Extraordinarily rich semantic field. (1) Confucian 德: moral virtue, character (为政以德, govern through virtue). (2) Daoist 德: the inherent power/potency a thing receives from 道; individual manifestation of cosmic principle. (3) Zhuangzi: inner power, authenticity. (4) Neo-Confucian: closely tied to 性 (nature). (5) Etymology: related to 得 (to obtain)—德 originally meant "what is obtained." The author's CONSTRUCTIVIST REINTERPRETATION: 德 = "what makes a thing what it is" (使得人而成为人的东西). More precisely: the collection of properties we *inductively generalize* from observations and then *normatively impose* as definitional. The key move: from 属性 (property—"people CAN have 仁") to 定义 (definition—"people SHOULD have 仁" or "有仁的才是人"). 德 is what we *decide* defines a thing, not what a thing inherently possesses ontologically. This resonates with Aristotelian essence but is framed as cognitive construction. DANGER: "Virtue" imports moral connotations the author strips away (德 applies to all things, not just moral agents). "Essence" imports Western metaphysical baggage. Best practice: use "De" romanized in philosophical passages, "inherent character" when English gloss needed, with translator's note on constructivist dimension.

---

## 仁 (rén)

- **Main translation**: **"Humaneness"** (preferred) or **"Fellow-feeling"**
- **Alternatives**: "Benevolence," "Human-heartedness," "Goodness," "Ren"
- **Note**: Core Confucian virtue. Traditionally: the fundamental disposition of care/concern for others, the basis of moral cultivation. Mencius: 仁者爱人 (The humane person loves others). The author distinguishes **现象仁** (phenomenal 仁) from the theoretical concept. 现象仁 = the inner feeling (发乎于心的对他人的感受) I experience when I care for others—a felt sentiment observable in myself. The author then describes projection: I see others performing 现象礼 and *assume* they have 现象仁 even though I cannot directly access their inner states. From "people CAN have 仁" (observed property), we leap to "people SHOULD have 仁" (definitional requirement). The author's usage emphasizes 仁 as *inner feeling first*, behavioral expression second. DANGER: "Benevolence" is too external/active. "Compassion" imports Buddhist overtones. "Love" is too broad. "Humaneness" or "fellow-feeling" best captures the experiential, empathetic dimension the author emphasizes. In passages about 现象仁, consider "the felt sentiment of care" or "the inner sense of fellow-feeling."

---

## 义 (yì)

- **Main translation**: **"Rightness"** (general); **"Moral impetus"** or **"Sense of obligation"** (author's specific usage)
- **Alternatives**: "Righteousness," "Duty," "Appropriateness," "Yi"
- **Note**: Traditional meanings: (1) Confucian: righteousness, moral appropriateness, what is fitting. (2) Mencius: 义者宜也 (Yi is what is appropriate). Often paired with 仁 as the two cardinal virtues. The author's SPECIFIC USAGE: 义 is the *motivational bridge* between inner feeling (仁) and outward action (礼). Described as "推动力" (motivation/driving force) and "motivation." In the phenomenology: 现象义 = the felt impulse/obligation I experience that moves me from feeling care (现象仁) to performing appropriate behavior (现象礼). This is more dynamic/kinetic than traditional readings. DANGER: "Righteousness" has become overly moralistic in English and suggests achieved virtue rather than motivational force. "Duty" is too Kantian. Best practice: "rightness" in traditional contexts, "moral impetus" or "sense of obligation" when author is describing the phenomenological movement from 仁 to 礼. Footnote explaining the motivational emphasis.

---

## 礼 (lǐ)

- **Main translation**: **"Ritual conduct"** (author's usage); **"Ritual"** or **"Propriety"** (traditional)
- **Alternatives**: "Rites," "Ceremonial propriety," "Pattern," "Ritual propriety"
- **Note**: Classical meaning: ritual, ceremony, proper conduct, the forms of social interaction. Confucius: 克己复礼为仁 (To master oneself and return to ritual is humaneness). In Xunzi, 礼 is human-created social form (人为). The author distinguishes **现象礼** (phenomenal 礼) = observable behavioral patterns in social interaction—concrete, visible conduct. This is the most empirical, phenomenal level of the 道德仁义礼 hierarchy. The author argues we start from observing 现象礼 (how people actually treat each other) and work upward, even though the conceptual presentation reverses this. DANGER: "Ritual" in English suggests religiosity or empty ceremony. The author's 现象礼 is simply observable social behavior patterns. Consider "ritual conduct" to emphasize the behavioral dimension, or "patterned behavior" when phenomenal immediacy is stressed. In traditional contexts, "ritual" or "propriety" work fine. The key distinction: 现象礼 (what we observe) vs. theoretical/normative 礼 (what the metaphysical system prescribes).

---

## 形而上 (xíng ér shàng)

- **Main translation**: **"The metaphysical"** (as adjective/substantive)
- **Alternatives**: "What is above form," "The supra-phenomenal"
- **Note**: Origin: 易经系辞传 (Xici zhuan), Ch. 8.5: "形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器" (What is above form is called the Way; what is within form is called implements). In classical usage, 形 = visible/manifest form; 形而上 = what transcends physical form (the Way); 形而下 = concrete implements. The author REINTERPRETS 形 as 现象 (phenomena) and distinguishes 形而上 (a framework of understanding above phenomena, a conceptual superstructure) from 形而上学 (the systematic study of metaphysics as discipline). The author's claim: "中国哲学大多是有形而上而无形而上学的"—Chinese philosophy predominantly operates within a given metaphysical framework (天道, 仁义) to achieve moral perfection, but does not typically *investigate the foundations* of that framework the way Western metaphysics does. DANGER: Collapsing 形而上 and 形而上学 into single "metaphysics." English "metaphysical" (adjective) vs. "metaphysics" (discipline) partially captures this. Translator must preserve the distinction consistently. Consider: "the metaphysical" vs. "metaphysics-as-discipline" or "metaphysical framework" vs. "metaphysical inquiry."

---

## 形而上学 (xíng ér shàng xué)

- **Main translation**: **"Metaphysics"** (as discipline) or **"Metaphysical inquiry"**
- **Alternatives**: "The study of the metaphysical," "Metaphysics-as-discipline"
- **Note**: The term 形而上学 was coined by Japanese scholar Inoue Tetsujiro (井上哲次郎) in the Meiji period to translate "metaphysics," combining 形而上 with 学 (study/discipline). The author insists: 形而上学 = the *systematic investigation* of metaphysics, the study of ultimate reality, distinct from 形而上 (a framework one inhabits). The author claims Chinese philosophy is mostly 有形而上而无形而上学—has metaphysical frameworks but lacks systematic metaphysical inquiry as a discipline (一是皆以修身为本, all start from self-cultivation). This is broadly accurate: Confucianism takes 天 and 仁 as given; Daoism takes 道 as given; even Neo-Confucian 理学 focuses on cultivation over pure inquiry. TRANSLATION: Use "metaphysics" where English demands a noun, but add clarifying phrases like "metaphysics as systematic inquiry" or "metaphysical investigation" to distinguish from 形而上. The distinction must be maintained throughout.

---

## 诗意 (shī yì)

- **Main translation**: **"The Poetic"** (capitalized as philosophical stance)
- **Alternatives**: "Poetic awareness," "Poetic engagement," "Poeticness," "Poetic sensibility"
- **Note**: Literally "poetic meaning/intention." In Chinese aesthetics, 诗意 refers to poetic sensibility, the evocative quality of poetry. Related to 意境 (artistic conception—synthesis of subjective intention 意 and objective scene 境). The author's RADICAL REFRAMING: 诗意 is NOT merely aesthetic but an *epistemic and existential stance*—the post-metaphysical position. Defined as **"清醒的梦境"** (lucid dream): knowing you are within a constructed experiential environment (境/梦境) while still fully committing to it. Binary opposition: **沉醉的梦境** = belief/faith (not realizing you're in a constructed framework) → 信念/信仰; **清醒的梦境** = 诗意 (knowing the framework is constructed but committing fully) → post-metaphysical stance. This is the answer to nihilism (虚无主义之后): since there is no 终极实在 and we cannot deny our feelings, the only path is to treat feelings poetically—lucidly, with full engagement despite/because of awareness of construction. Resonances: (1) Zhuangzi's 庄周梦蝶 but without skeptical uncertainty—affirms engagement; (2) Chan/Zen "returning to marketplace" after enlightenment but without Buddhist soteriology; (3) 意境 tradition's awareness that greatest art knows its artifice yet transcends it. DANGER: "Poetic" in English trivializes the existential weight. The translator must establish early that 诗意 is an *existential category*, not literary appreciation. Use "the Poetic" (capitalized) to signal philosophical weight, comparable to "the Aesthetic" or "the Sublime." In context: "poetic awareness," "poetic stance," "poetic engagement."

---

## 意境 (yì jìng)

- **Main translation**: **"Artistic conception"** or **"Realm of meaning"**
- **Alternatives**: "Mood and atmosphere," "Poetic realm," "Aesthetic realm"
- **Note**: Classical Chinese aesthetic term. 意 = subjective intention/meaning of artist; 境 = objective scene/realm depicted; 意境 = their synthesis, the fusion of subjective feeling and objective scene. The tradition stretches from Wang Changling 王昌龄 (Tang: 物境/情境/意境—realm of things/feelings/ideas) through Wang Guowei 王国维 (人间词话). The author uses 意境 in its traditional aesthetic sense, distinct from the technical term 境. When discussing 诗意, the author is building on but going beyond 意境 theory—moving from aesthetics to existential stance. Translation: Use "artistic conception" for traditional aesthetic usage. Do not confuse with technical 境 (Jing).

---

## 恒常 (héng cháng)

- **Main translation**: **"Constancy"**
- **Alternatives**: "Permanence" (avoid), "Invariance" (too mathematical), "The constant"
- **Note**: 常 is fundamental in Laozi: "道可道,非常道" (The Way that can be spoken is not the constant Way); "知常曰明" (Knowing the constant is illumination). 恒 adds emphasis on endurance. In Daoist tradition, 常 = unchanging pattern beneath change, eternal principle. Buddhism counters with 无常 (impermanence, anicca). The author's DISTINCT USAGE: 恒常 is **epistemological and pragmatic**, not ontological. Definition: "形而上的核心是恒常"—the core of metaphysical thinking is constancy. It is a "保证" (guarantee): "同样的现象（实在）将会重复的出现"—the same phenomena will recur. This is NOT saying things really ARE permanent (Daoist 常) or really are impermanent (Buddhist 无常)—it is saying we *seek* invariant patterns in phenomena in order to act meaningfully. Without constancy, we have no "抓手" (handle/grip) on phenomena—we cannot act with purpose (就像拿手指在波涛汹涌的海洋中随手搅拌一样, like stirring the turbulent ocean with a finger). The pursuit of 恒常 is explicitly identified as *non-rational* (非理性)—we pursue it not because reason demands it but because without it action is impossible. Tied to 同一 (identity) and 因果 (causality), which the author claims are temporal 同一. In K1 strategy, formalized as "stable structure" (稳定结构, S_E). DANGER: "Permanence" implies ontological fixity the author denies. "Eternity" is too theological. "Invariance" is too technical. "Constancy" appropriately straddles epistemological necessity and phenomenological seeking. Use "constancy" with footnote explaining the epistemological/pragmatic (not ontological) character.

---

## 常 (cháng)

- **Main translation**: **"The constant"** or **"Constancy"**
- **Alternatives**: "The eternal," "Permanence" (Daoist contexts)
- **Note**: See 恒常 above. 常 alone has same Daoist pedigree. When the author uses 常 without 恒, context determines if traditional Daoist sense or the author's epistemological sense. Typically the author uses 恒常 for the technical concept.

---

## 虚无 (xū wú)

- **Main translation**: **"The void"** or **"Nothingness"**
- **Alternatives**: "Emptiness" (avoid—too Buddhist)
- **Note**: In the author's usage, 虚无 refers to nihilism's void—the absence left when the highest value (终极实在, ultimate reality) collapses. Explicitly NOT a positive entity: "虚无主义不是一种有、一种主义，而是一种无" (Nihilism is not a something, a doctrine, but a nothing, a lack). The author gives personal etymology (footnote in 诗意 essay): 虚 = "without real significance," 妄 = "arrogant, self-deceptive." CRITICAL DISTINCTION from Buddhist 空 (śūnyatā, emptiness)—these are completely different. The author's 虚无 is the *absence of transcendent ground* after metaphysics collapses, not the Buddhist insight into dependent origination and emptiness of inherent existence. Buddhist 空 is a *positive* philosophical realization; nihilistic 虚无 is a *negative* collapse. The translator must never conflate these. Use "the void" or "nothingness" for 虚无; reserve "emptiness" for Buddhist 空.

---

## 空 (kōng)

- **Main translation**: **"Emptiness"** (Buddhist); **"Empty"** (adjectival)
- **Alternatives**: "Void," "Vacuity," "Śūnyatā" (transliterated Sanskrit)
- **Note**: In Buddhist contexts, 空 translates Sanskrit *śūnyatā* (emptiness)—the Madhyamaka teaching that all phenomena lack inherent existence, arise through dependent origination. A central Mahayana concept. In Chinese aesthetics (Chan/Zen), 空灵 (ethereal emptiness) is an aesthetic quality. When author uses 空, determine from context whether Buddhist philosophical sense or general sense of "empty/vacant." Do NOT confuse with nihilistic 虚无. The author rarely uses 空 in technical Buddhist sense—mostly uses it in examples (like "空" as terminal object in 忒修斯之船 thought experiment). Translation: "Emptiness" for Buddhist contexts, "empty" or "void" otherwise, with care not to conflate with 虚无.

---

## 现象 (xiàn xiàng)

- **Main translation**: **"Phenomena"**
- **Alternatives**: "Phenomenon" (singular), "Appearances"
- **Note**: Standard philosophical translation of phenomena. The author gives it full phenomenological weight: "what we currently 'have'"—the totality of what appears to us; called **第一实在** (first reality). Explicitly modeled on phenomenological usage (Kant, Husserl). "我们任何的对于现象的理解，都基于现象" (Any understanding of phenomena is based on phenomena). Phenomena are **the foundation** (第一实在), not derivative. The author reinterprets 形 (form) from the Xici zhuan as 现象. DANGER: In everyday Chinese, 现象 just means "situation" or "occurrence." The author gives it philosophical weight—what appears to consciousness, the given experiential manifold. The translator must signal this is technical phenomenological usage, not colloquial "phenomenon." Consider initial note: "Throughout, 'phenomena' (现象) refers not merely to observable events but to the totality of what appears to consciousness—the experiential given, following phenomenological tradition."

---

## 感受 (gǎn shòu)

- **Main translation**: **"Felt experience"** or **"Feeling"**
- **Alternatives**: "Sensation," "Felt sense"
- **Note**: The author uses 感受 to refer to parts of P (phenomena). Defined as any element of experiential manifold. The author notes (footnote 2 of 诗意 essay) that 感受 has two senses: (1) received stimulus/information (受到之感觉); (2) the crystallized/emergent feeling that results (构成的"结晶"、"涌动"、"湍流"). P is "全部的感受之总和" (the totality of felt experience). Also: "感受和意义即是两面一体" (feeling and meaning are two sides of one thing). DANGER: English "feeling" can trivialize (suggesting emotion only). "Sensation" is too narrow (sense-data only). The author means something broader: any element of experiential consciousness. Consider "felt experience" to capture experiential breadth, or "feeling" with initial note clarifying this includes all experiential content, not just emotions. In technical passages about P, consider "experiential content" or "experiential element."

---

## 体验 (tǐ yàn)

- **Main translation**: **"Lived experience"** or **"Experience"**
- **Alternatives**: "Undergone experience"
- **Note**: 体验 = lived/undergone experience, emphasizing the experiential process. The author sometimes uses 感受 and 体验 interchangeably, sometimes distinguishes them. Both refer to parts of P. 体验 emphasizes the *living-through* quality. When discussing games, art, life, the author often uses 体验 (游戏体验, 剧情体验, 哲学体验)—the experience obtained. Translation: "lived experience" emphasizes phenomenological dimension; "experience" works when context is clear. Distinguished from 感受 primarily by emphasis: 体验 = process of experiencing; 感受 = felt content/quality.

---

## 梦境 (mèng jìng)

- **Main translation**: **"Dream-realm"**
- **Alternatives**: "Dreamscape," "Experiential dream-realm"
- **Note**: NOT literal dreaming. The author writes: "梦境并不仅仅是指的我们在睡觉时脑海中呈现的景象" (Dream-realm does not merely refer to scenes in our mind when sleeping). Also considers names: "游戏、书、冒险、小世界、小自在" (game, book, adventure, small world, small freedom). Definition: **an experiential environment that makes certain meanings possible**; the "packaging" of experience; the context in which purpose and meaning arise. Examples: games, novels, rituals, relationships—any structured experiential environment. 梦境 includes both 沉醉的梦境 (immersed dream = belief/faith, unaware of construction) and 清醒的梦境 (lucid dream = 诗意, aware but committed). The term first appears in "形而上学后的目的:诗意" then evolves into technical 境. DANGER: English "dream" implies unreality, illusion, sleep-state. The author explicitly resists this—梦境 is any meaning-making experiential context, constructed but real in its effects. The poetic resonance of "dream" is intentional but must not reduce to "illusion." Use "dream-realm" to preserve both 梦 and 境, or expand to "experiential dream-realm" when clarification needed.

---

## 清醒 (qīng xǐng)

- **Main translation**: **"Lucid"** or **"Aware"**
- **Alternatives**: "Awake," "Clear-minded," "Conscious"
- **Note**: In the binary 沉醉的梦境 vs. 清醒的梦境: 清醒 = aware, knowing you are in a 梦境. Literally "clear/awake." The author: "所谓清醒，即是说我们知道我们在梦境之中" (What is called lucidity is knowing we are in a dream-realm). This is NOT detachment or disengagement—清醒 means full awareness of the constructed nature *while maintaining full commitment*. Like lucid dreaming: you know you're dreaming but continue to engage. Translation: "Lucid" captures the dream metaphor perfectly (lucid dreaming). "Aware" works in contexts where dream metaphor is not active. "Awake" risks suggesting you've exited the dream (opposite of intended meaning).

---

## 沉醉 (chén zuì)

- **Main translation**: **"Immersed"** or **"Intoxicated"**
- **Alternatives**: "Absorbed," "Enchanted"
- **Note**: In 沉醉的梦境 = belief/faith (信念/信仰). The author: "所谓沉醉，即是说我们没有意识到我们在梦境中" (What is called immersion is not being aware we are in a dream-realm). Without awareness of construction, the 梦境 becomes absolute—its purpose becomes "逻辑上无理由的" (logically groundless) "终极之实在" (ultimate reality). Literally: 沉 = sink, 醉 = intoxicated/drunk. Translation: "Immersed" (neutral, captures absorption without negative connotation) or "intoxicated" (preserves Chinese metaphor, suggests lack of clear awareness, but risks negative judgment). Consider "unreflectively immersed" or "naively absorbed" if context demands clarity. The key: 沉醉 lacks the self-awareness that defines 清醒, but is not pejorative—it simply describes pre-philosophical or pre-critical stance.

---

## 实在 (shí zài)

- **Main translation**: **"Reality"** (with numerical prefixes preserved)
- **Alternatives**: "The real," "Actuality"
- **Note**: The author uses numbered realities: **第一实在** (first reality) = phenomena (现象), what appears to consciousness; **第二实在** (second reality) = constructed objects/concepts we build from phenomena (the "objective world" in our recognition); **第〇实在** (zeroth reality) = the posited "true" objective world prior to observation. The author's critical claim: "对于我们而言，并不存在第〇实在，而只存在第二实在" (For us, zeroth reality does not exist, only second reality exists). "当我们提出第〇实在时，这个我们所提出的东西就是第二实在" (When we posit zeroth reality, what we posit is actually second reality). This parallels the 道 argument: just as 道 is produced last but presented first, 第〇实在 is posited as prior but is actually a construction. DANGER: The number scheme is the author's invention—must be explained. "First reality" does NOT mean "most real" in ontological sense (author's footnote 25 warns). The reader must not import Western metaphysical assumptions. Translation: Use "reality" with numerical prefixes consistently: "first reality," "second reality," "zeroth reality." Initial translator's note required explaining: (1) numbering is epistemological order of access, not ontological hierarchy; (2) first reality is foundational because it's what we have, not because it's "most real."

---

## 属性 (shǔ xìng)

- **Main translation**: **"Property"** or **"Attribute"**
- **Alternatives**: "Characteristic" (less precise)
- **Note**: Used in the crucial move from 属性 to 定义. The author: from "people CAN have 仁" (observed property, 属性) to "people SHOULD have 仁" (normative definition, 定义)—"有仁的才是人." Properties (属性) are what we observe things having; definitions (定义) are what we decide things must have to count as what they are. This is the mechanism by which 德 (inherent character) is constructed. Standard translation "property" works well—captures the philosophical sense of properties things possess contingently.

---

## 定义 (dìng yì)

- **Main translation**: **"Definition"**
- **Alternatives**: "Defining characteristic"
- **Note**: See 属性 above. The move from 属性 (property) to 定义 (definition) is central to the author's constructivist account. An observed 属性 becomes a normative 定义—we go from "this is something things can have" to "this is what makes a thing count as what it is." Standard translation "definition" is clear and precise.

---

## 天 (tiān)

- **Main translation**: **"Heaven"** (traditional cosmological sense) or **"Nature"** (in 自然 compounds)
- **Alternatives**: "Sky," "Tian" (romanized)
- **Note**: Fundamental concept in Chinese cosmology and ethics. In early texts: the cosmic moral order, sometimes personified, sometimes impersonal. Confucius: 天命 (Mandate of Heaven). Mencius: 天 as source of moral nature. Daoist 天道 (Way of Heaven) = natural cosmic pattern. The author rarely uses 天 as technical term—when it appears, usually in citations of traditional philosophy (天道, 天命) or in 自然 (nature, naturalness). Translation: "Heaven" for cosmological/moral sense; "nature" in compounds like 自然. When romanizing helps clarify traditional concept, use "Tian" with gloss.

---

## 理 (lǐ)

- **Main translation**: **"Principle"** (Neo-Confucian) or **"Pattern"**
- **Alternatives**: "Li" (romanized), "Coherence," "Underlying order"
- **Note**: Extremely important in Neo-Confucian philosophy. Zhu Xi's 理学 (School of Principle): 理 = the coherent pattern/principle inherent in all things, paired with 气 (material force/energy). 理 is what makes things what they are, the intelligible structure. The author does not deeply engage Neo-Confucian 理 theory, but 理 appears in examples and citations. When the author uses 理, often means "rational principle" or "underlying pattern." Translation: "Principle" for Neo-Confucian contexts (established convention); "pattern" emphasizes structural/organizational aspect; "coherence" captures the intelligibility dimension. The author's own framework shares some concerns with 理学 (what structures experience?) but approaches differently (through 境 and category theory rather than 理/气 metaphysics).

---

## 气 (qì)

- **Main translation**: **"Qi"** (romanized) or **"Material force"**
- **Alternatives**: "Vital energy," "Ether," "Pneuma"
- **Note**: In Neo-Confucian metaphysics (especially Zhu Xi), 气 is material force/energy, paired with 理 (principle). All things are composed of 理 and 气. Earlier: vital energy, breath, life force. The author does not extensively engage 气 theory. When it appears, usually in citations or comparisons with traditional philosophy. Translation: "Qi" (romanized) with gloss, or "material force" in Neo-Confucian contexts following convention (Wing-tsit Chan translation). "Vital energy" works for earlier, less technical uses.

---

## 性 (xìng)

- **Main translation**: **"Nature"** or **"Inherent nature"**
- **Alternatives**: "Xing" (romanized), "Natural disposition"
- **Note**: Fundamental concept in Chinese ethical philosophy. Mencius: human 性 is originally good (性善). Xunzi: human 性 is originally bad (性恶). Neo-Confucian: 性即理 (nature is principle, Wang Yangming) vs. 性 receives 理 (Zhu Xi). The author's related concept is 德 (inherent character), but 德 is explicitly constructivist while traditional 性 is more essentialist. The author does not extensively theorize 性. When it appears, usually traditional sense. Translation: "nature" or "inherent nature." When precision needed, "natural disposition" or romanize "Xing" with explanation.

---

## 我 (wǒ)

- **Main translation**: **"I"** or **"Self"**
- **Alternatives**: "Ego," "The self"
- **Note**: Standard first-person pronoun, but philosophically loaded. The author's account of 我 (in 忒修斯之船 section): "我"是那个感受，那个当你提到任何有关我的方面时，都会让我联想到的那个感受 (The "I" is that feeling, the one that comes to mind when you mention any aspect related to me). "我" is the 范性质 (universal property) of the subcategory of experiences associated with oneself. When we create something (劳动成果), it can become part of "我" because seeing it activates the "我"-feeling. This is a structural/phenomenological account of selfhood, not a metaphysical substance. Translation: "I" for first-person usage; "the self" when discussing the concept philosophically; "the sense of self" when emphasizing experiential dimension. The author's account resonates with Buddhist 无我 (no-self) but approaches from phenomenological rather than soteriological angle.

---

## 非理性 (fēi lǐ xìng)

- **Main translation**: **"The non-rational"** or **"The irrational"**
- **Alternatives**: "Non-rationality," "That which lies outside reason"
- **Note**: Carefully defined by author. Does NOT mean "unreasonable" or "contrary to reason." Means: **that which lies outside the scope of reason**; what cannot be grounded in reason but must simply be acknowledged (承认). The author's claim: "理性的目的必然要在理性之外" (The purpose of reason must lie outside reason)—reason is instrumental, its goals are non-rational. "对恒常性的追求本身就是非理性的" (The pursuit of constancy itself is non-rational). The pursuit of meaning, the desire for metaphysical frameworks—these are 非理性. This is NOT a pejorative—the author insists 非理性 must be *acknowledged* (承认), not suppressed. The author: "这种非理性是应当被承认的" (This non-rationality should be acknowledged). In post-metaphysical framework, acknowledging 非理性 is essential. DANGER: "Irrational" in English often means "unreasonable," "crazy," "going against reason." The author means something more like "arational"—simply outside reason's domain, neither rational nor contra-rational. Best translation: "the non-rational" with initial note clarifying this means "outside reason's scope," not "unreasonable." In contexts where this is clear, "irrational" acceptable if less awkward, but "non-rational" is more precise.

## 自我实现 (zì wǒ shí xiàn)

- **Main translation**: **"Self-realization"**
- **Alternatives**: "Self-actualization" (avoid—Maslow-specific)
- **Note**: The author explicitly glosses: "使得自我得以成为现实" (making the self become reality). An active, constructive process. The author connects to need for 实践 (practice): "理想和现象之重叠" (the overlapping of ideal and phenomena)—we see ourselves in phenomena, "证实我的存在" (confirm my existence), make phenomena "我的一部分" (part of me) through realizing our ideals in phenomena. This resonates with Hegelian self-realization (Selbstverwirklichung) and Maslow's self-actualization, but the author's emphasis is on the *practical* process of making ideals real in experience, not achieving a pre-given potential. Translation: "Self-realization" is standard and adequate. Clarify in context that this is constructive/active, not fulfilling pre-existing essence. "Realization of self" works if emphasis on process needed.

## 联想 (lián xiǎng)

- **Main translation**: **"Association"**
- **Alternatives**: "Mental association," "Linking"
- **Note**: In category theory formalization, 联想 becomes *morphisms* in the category E (境). Definition: the connections between experiences. Example: seeing a pencil makes me think of a pen—the 联想 links them. The author: "其中这些对象之间的联系（称之为联想，也是P的一部分，也是一种感受），作为E中的态射" (The connections between these objects, called associations, are also part of P, also a kind of feeling, and serve as morphisms in E). So associations are themselves *experiences* (part of P) that link other experiences. DANGER: 联想 also means "imagination" in Chinese—not the intended sense here. Clarify "association" as in "association of ideas," mental linking. Standard philosophical translation.

## 同一 (tóng yī)

- **Main translation**: **"Identity"** or **"Sameness"**
- **Alternatives**: "Unity," "Oneness" (avoid—too mystical)
- **Note**: The author connects to 恒常. "有人将形而上学的基础总结为同一、因果。然而，因果即为时间上的同一" (Some summarize the foundation of metaphysics as identity and causality. However, causality is just temporal identity). 同一 = recognizing something as the same across time or context. Example: "我们眼前的一个苹果（的图像），在下一刻，他和这一刻，是同一个东西——既是恒常" (The apple image before us, in the next moment, is the same thing as this moment—this is constancy). Standard philosophical translation "identity" works well.

---

## 因果 (yīn guǒ)

- **Main translation**: **"Causality"** or **"Cause and effect"**
- **Alternatives**: "Causal connection"
- **Note**: The author's claim: "因果即为时间上的同一" (Causality is just temporal identity). Recognizing causal connections is recognizing constancy across time. This is part of the non-rational pursuit of 恒常 that makes action possible. Standard translation "causality" is clear.

---

## 虚无主义 (xū wú zhǔ yì)

- **Main translation**: **"Nihilism"**
- **Note**: Standard translation. The author frames the entire project as post-nihilist (虚无主义之后). Nihilism is "形而上学的末路" (the end of metaphysics)—what remains when "终极实在" (ultimate reality) collapses. But crucially: "虚无主义不是一种有、一种主义，而是一种无、一种缺位" (Nihilism is not a something, a doctrine, but a nothing, a lack). It's not produced but is what's left when production ceases.

---

## 终极实在 (zhōng jí shí zài)

- **Main translation**: **"Ultimate reality"**
- **Alternatives**: "Ultimate real," "Final reality," "Absolute reality"
- **Note**: What traditional metaphysics seeks—the final ground, the root source (根源). The author's claim: "事实上并不存在这样的终极实在可以被触及" (In fact, no such ultimate reality exists that can be reached). The collapse of 终极实在 is what produces 虚无 (the void). Standard translation "ultimate reality" is clear.

## 现象礼/现象义/现象仁 (xiàn xiàng lǐ/yì/rén)

- **Main translation**: **"Phenomenal ritual," "phenomenal rightness," "phenomenal humaneness"**
- **Alternatives**: "Observable ritual conduct," "felt obligation," "felt fellow-feeling"
- **Note**: The author's innovation—distinguishing the *observable/experienced* instances from the *theoretical concept*. 现象礼 = concrete behavioral patterns I observe; 现象仁 = the inner feeling I actually experience when I care for someone; 现象义 = the felt motivation connecting feeling to action. These are *parts of phenomena* (现象的一部分), not abstract concepts. The abstract concepts (仁义礼) are then *constructed* from these phenomenal instances through projection and generalization. This distinction is CRUCIAL to the reversal argument. Translation: "Phenomenal X" preserves the structure; could expand to "experienced X" or "observable X" depending on context. Footnotes explaining the phenomenal/conceptual distinction are essential.

## 后形而上学 (hòu xíng ér shàng xué)

- **Main translation**: **"Post-metaphysics"**
- **Alternatives**: "Metaphysics after metaphysics," "Post-metaphysical philosophy"
- **Note**: The author's framework. "后形而上学，必然是虚无主义之后才可以产生的形而上学" (Post-metaphysics must be metaphysics that can only arise after nihilism). Definition: "以现象为核心，承认所有形而上皆为现象之上的构造的形而上学" (Metaphysics centered on phenomena, acknowledging all metaphysical constructs are constructions upon phenomena). Key features: (1) recognizes pursuit of 第〇实在 stems from 非理性; (2) gives 现象 special foundational status; (3) acknowledges 非理性 while formalizing the framework; (4) maintains functionality of 实践 (practice). Standard "post-metaphysics" works well.

---

## 前形而上学 (qián xíng ér shàng xué)

- **Main translation**: **"Pre-nihilist metaphysics"** or **"Traditional metaphysics"**
- **Alternatives**: "Classical metaphysics"
- **Note**: The author's term for metaphysics before nihilism—metaphysics that still seeks 终极实在 without recognizing its constructed character. "所谓前，指的是相对于虚无主义而言的前" (What is called 'pre' refers to before nihilism). This includes both Western metaphysical traditions and Chinese 形而上 frameworks. Translation: "Pre-nihilist metaphysics" is precise; "traditional metaphysics" may be clearer in context.

---

## 稳定结构 (wěn dìng jié gòu)

- **Main translation**: **"Stable structure"**
- **Note**: In K1 strategy essay, formalized as S_E—the structure preserved across evolution of 境. The author notes: "物理、心理等科学所做的就是在某个特定的子范畴内寻找和描述这一境的稳定结构的实践" (What sciences like physics and psychology do is seek and describe stable structures of Jing within specific subcategories). These are the *invariant patterns* we seek (manifestation of 恒常 pursuit). Standard translation "stable structure" is clear and precise.

## Translation Note on the 道德仁义礼 Sequence

The translator must be especially careful with the 道德仁义礼 (Way-Character-Humaneness-Rightness-Ritual) sequence, as the author presents it in BOTH directions:

1. **Top-down (traditional presentation)**: {(道,0), (德,1), (仁,1), (义,2), (礼,3)} — 道 as source, generating all else
2. **Bottom-up (author's genealogy)**: {(道,5), (德,4), (仁,3), (义,2), (礼,1)} — 礼 as phenomenal starting point, 道 as final abstraction

When translating passages about this sequence, the translator MUST signal which direction is operative. Suggested strategy: use "the Way→Character→Humaneness→Rightness→Ritual sequence" for top-down, and "the Ritual→Rightness→Humaneness→Character→Way construction" for bottom-up. Frequent translator's notes reminding the reader of the reversal are essential.

## Concluding Note for Translators

This dictionary represents the terminological core of a genuinely original philosophical project that stands with one foot in the Chinese philosophical tradition and one foot outside it. The author uses traditional vocabulary as a *resource* while fundamentally reinterpreting it.

The greatest danger is **collapsing the author's meaning back into traditional readings**. Every reader familiar with Chinese philosophy will bring expectations about what 道, 德, 仁, 境, etc. mean. The translator must simultaneously *evoke* those traditional resonances (which the author intentionally activates) while *preventing* automatic assimilation to traditional meanings.

**Strategy recommendations**:

1. **Use romanization + gloss** for terms where the gap between traditional and authorial meaning is widest (境, 德, 诗意)
2. **Use standard translations with heavy apparatus** (footnotes, translator's introduction, glossary) for terms like 道, 仁, 义 where tradition must be acknowledged but reinterpretation foregrounded
3. **Introduce each major term formally** when it first appears, with a note: "This term has traditional meaning X, but the author reinterprets it as Y"
4. **Create a running glossary** at the back of the translated volume
5. **Write a substantial translator's introduction** explaining the hermeneutic challenge: the author is *inside* and *beyond* the tradition simultaneously

This is not a translation of classical Chinese philosophy. This is a translation of a 21st-century philosopher *thinking with and through* classical Chinese philosophy to arrive at new positions. The translator must be, like the author, both faithful to tradition and faithful to innovation.
