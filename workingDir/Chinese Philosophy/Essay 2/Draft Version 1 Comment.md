## Summary

The translator's approach is correct: preserve the author's English verbatim, add minimal apparatus. The single Translator's Note appropriately connects "phenomena" to the collection's technical 现象 without over-explaining.

## From Chinese Philosophy Perspective

**No issues raised.** The draft handles this well as-is.

### Observations (not flags)

1. **The "digestion" argument** — phenomena must be converted into thoughts/beliefs before use — structurally parallels 格物致知 (investigating things to extend knowledge). The author arrives at a similar insight through Western epistemological analysis: we don't passively receive phenomena; we actively process them into cognitive content. This resonance need not be flagged in the translation but is worth noting for interpretive purposes.

2. **Deflationary knowledge = belief** — This conclusion (knowledge is "what each individual believes to be correct") resembles certain Buddhist epistemological positions, particularly the Madhyamaka critique of *pramāṇa* (valid cognition) as itself conventionally established. The author's position is more pragmatic than Buddhist, but the structural similarity is real.

3. **Phenomena as First Reality** — The TN correctly identifies this as laying groundwork for 第一实在. Chinese readers may find this move more intuitive than Western readers, given the Chinese philosophical tendency to begin from 心 (heart-mind) and its contents rather than from external objects.

4. **The author's sidenote on "phenomena"** — The author already glosses "phenomena" as "what we experience or observe." The TN appropriately extends this to the collection's technical vocabulary without redundancy.

## Apparatus Assessment

- **TN on 现象**: Appropriate and sufficient
- **No additional Chinese philosophy TN needed**: The essay stands independently; forcing Chinese philosophical parallels would distort the author's Western-oriented presentation

## Verdict

**Approved as-is.** The minimal apparatus approach is correct for an author-original English essay. The TN bridges to the collection's framework without over-interpretation.
