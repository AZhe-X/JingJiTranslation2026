# Reading Notes — 境集

## Essay 1: 关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一

**Core argument:**
The essay addresses whether "collective interest" (集体利益) is a genuine concept or merely reducible to aggregated individual interests.

**Key philosophical moves:**

1. **Initial skepticism**: Collective interest seems to dissolve into the interests of individuals within the collective. What could "the collective's interest" mean apart from this?

2. **The renormalization response**: The author borrows 重整化 (renormalization) from physics. Just as low-energy effective theories emerge from high-energy interactions, macro-level phenomena (like collective interest) are "well-defined" (良定义) at their own scale, even though they emerge from micro-level realities.

3. **The ocean analogy**: Water molecules have their own motion patterns; ocean waves have different, emergent patterns. Both are real, both are describable. Collective interest is like the wave pattern — emergent but genuinely there.

4. **The grounding of empathy**: Humans can only start from and return to themselves as individuals. But this limitation is also what makes empathy (共情) possible — we understand others precisely because we share the same type of existence. A collective-as-whole could not understand individual suffering the way another individual can.

5. **Laws operate at the threshold**: Legal/regulatory systems affect individuals but shape macro-patterns — like temperature affecting ocean behavior. This is the level where collective interest becomes well-defined.

6. **Abstraction as renormalization**: The essay suggests that abstraction itself may be connected to renormalization — abstract concepts are emergent phenomena at different scales. Family, community, people, humanity are renormalization results at different scales.

**Key terms for translation:**
- 重整化 — renormalization (physics term, used philosophically)
- 良定义 — well-defined (mathematical term)
- 有效存在 — effective existence (physics: "effective" theories)
- 现象 — phenomena (scale-dependent emergent realities)
- 共情 — empathy
- 涌现 — emergence

**Chinese philosophy connections:**
- The individual-as-starting-point resonates with Confucian self-cultivation beginning from 修身
- But the framework is distinctly modern/scientific — physics-inflected
- The micro/macro structure recalls 体用 debates but operates differently

## Essay 2: A Thought on Knowledge

**Core argument:**
A pragmatic/phenomenological critique of the classical definition of knowledge as "justified true belief" — examining what actually happens when humans form, check, and justify knowledge.

**Key philosophical moves:**

1. **Belief is intrinsically subjective**: As thought, belief is subjective. Its connection to "objective truth" (if any) is extrinsic — mediated through phenomena.

2. **We access phenomena, not truth**: To verify "it is raining outside," we can only look outside — but we see the *phenomenon* of rain (which could be a fancy sprinkler). We never compare belief directly against truth.

3. **The truth condition is methodologically impossible**: In practice, we cannot use knowledge against truth directly. We check memory, consult reports, observe phenomena — all beliefs or phenomena, never truth itself.

4. **Justification bases collapse**: Starting points for justification must be: (a) justified beliefs, (b) phenomena, or (c) truths. But truths aren't directly accessible in practice; and phenomena require "digestion" (转化) into thoughts before use — so phenomena-based justification is really justified-belief-based justification.

5. **The regress problem**: If all justification is belief-based, then either (a) circular justification, or (b) grounded in unjustified beliefs, or (c) infinite regress (impossible in finite life). This suggests knowledge may simply be... belief.

6. **Practical conclusion**: In practice, what exists is "what each individual believes to be correct." Extendable to "what most people in a field believe to be correct" — a working definition of knowledge.

**Important examples:**
- The rain/sprinkler case — phenomena ≠ direct truth access
- The three Bobs — phenomena require digestion into belief
- High-energy physics — particles never directly observed, only signals reconstructed through models
- Mathematical proof — mathematicians work from what is "taken to be true"

**Key terms for translation:**
- phenomena (现象) — what we experience or observe, not truth itself
- digestion (消化/转化) — converting phenomena into thoughts/beliefs
- justified belief — second-order belief (belief about belief)
- truth condition — methodologically impossible in practice

**Chinese philosophy connections:**
- Resonates with Buddhist pramāṇa critique — the means of valid cognition are themselves conditioned
- Echoes Zhuangzi's 是非 (this/that, right/wrong) — perspective-dependent judgment without access to absolute standpoint
- The "digestion" of phenomena into belief recalls 心 (xīn) as the processing/interpreting faculty
- The pragmatic turn parallels the Neo-Confucian emphasis on 工夫 (practice/effort) over purely theoretical knowledge
- Distinct from Wang Yangming's 良知 — here there's no innate knowing that cuts through mediation

**Notable features:**
- Written in English (unlike other essays)
- Has abstract and acknowledgements (thanks Claude for drafting abstract)
- Uses scientific examples (physics, mathematics) to illustrate philosophical points
- This essay connects the 重整化 (renormalization) framework from Essay 1 to epistemology — phenomena are what we access, not underlying "truth"

## Essay 3: 西西弗斯、班与猫 (Sisyphus, Ban, and the Cat)

**Core argument:**
A critique of absurdism's framing — the absurd only arises when you've already made the error of seeking meaning externally. Meaning is internally generated; looking outward for it is "asking the wrong question."

**Key philosophical moves:**

1. **The absurd as misdirected seeking**: Absurdity describes a dissonance (非和谐, 错位) between the human seeking meaning and the universe's non-response. But the author's response: "You're asking the wrong question!" — meaning is generated internally, not found externally. Seeking meaning in the universe is like looking for your lost watch in places you've never been.

2. **The office worker example**: A graduate works for years, achieves promotions, but eventually asks: "What's the meaning of work?" The absurd arrives. But contrast this with the entrepreneur who works for their own goals — same conditions, no absurdity. The difference is 异化 (alienation) — when meaning is externalized, work becomes estranged from the self.

3. **Reinterpreting Sisyphus**: Camus' "rebellion against the absurd" is itself an internal meaning-generation. Sisyphus is happy because he regenerates internal purpose (目标) even if it's directed against the external ("transcendent") gods/cosmos.

4. **The cat example** — the essay's masterstroke:
   - Caring for a cat is repetitive, demanding, endless (like pushing a boulder)
   - But no cat owner experiences absurdity about it
   - There's no "transcendent" meaning in cat care — internal or external
   - No dramatic rebellion against cosmic absurdity is needed
   - "We just want to have a cat, we like living with a cat, that's all" (仅此而已)

5. **The key insight**: When meaning is internally generated (内生), absurdity dissolves as if it never came (荒谬就自然消解了，就像是他未曾来过一样). Cat-care meaning doesn't even need rational articulation — we feel satisfaction naturally in the process.

**Key terms for translation:**
- 荒谬 — the absurd
- 非和谐 (off-tone) — dissonance, the feeling of absurdity
- 错位 — mislocation, being out of place
- 异化 — alienation (Marxist term)
- 超越/超越性 — transcendence/transcendent
- 内生/内化 — internally generated/internalized
- 外化 — externalized
- 内在目标 — internal purpose/goal

**Chinese philosophy connections:**

This essay resonates powerfully with several Chinese traditions:

*Zhuangzi:*
- The cat example evokes Zhuangzi's useless tree (无用之木) that lives out its full years precisely because it has no externally-defined purpose
- 遊 (wandering) as non-purposive activity that contains its own satisfaction
- The craftsmen stories (Cook Ding, wheelwright) where meaning is immanent in skilled activity itself
- Rejection of 是非 (right/wrong) judgments from external standpoints

*Daoist critique of artificiality:*
- The 异化 critique connects to 伪 (artificiality) — when human activity becomes estranged from natural flow
- 无为 as not-seeking, not-grasping — parallel to not seeking meaning externally

*Confucian resonances:*
- The emphasis on 内 (internal) over 外 (external) has Mencian echoes — moral sprouts arise from within
- But the essay doesn't posit a structured internal nature — just raw preference and attachment

*Important distinction:*
- Unlike Western existentialism's "authentic choice," the cat example suggests something even more basic — pre-reflective enjoyment, not chosen commitment
- This is closer to the Zhuangzian 自然 (spontaneous/natural) than Sartrean authenticity

**Notable features:**
- Title seems to reference 班 (Ban) but the text doesn't explicitly discuss "Ban" — possibly a nickname for the author's cat, or a reference I'm missing
- Dated 20250606 (June 6, 2025) — one of the more recent essays
- Extremely concrete and relatable examples
- The cat example brilliantly deflates the dramatic register of existentialism

## Essay 4: 后形而上学 整理 (Post-Metaphysics, Compiled)

**Core argument:**
A systematic account of metaphysics that (1) traces how metaphysical constructs are generated from phenomena (not the reverse), (2) diagnoses traditional metaphysics' "inversion" of this order, (3) accepts nihilism as its natural collapse, and (4) proposes a "post-metaphysics" that acknowledges non-rationality and centers practice.

**Key concepts:**

**1. 现象 (phenomena) as 第一实在 (First Reality):**
- What we directly experience is our starting point — we cannot step outside it
- The "上" in 形而上 should mean "based upon phenomena," not "generating phenomena from above"
- Phenomena are "first reality" — not an ontological claim, but a practical/epistemological one

**2. Levels of "reality":**
- 第一实在 — phenomena (what we directly experience)
- 第二实在 — our constructs based on phenomena (the "objective world" we posit)
- 第〇实在 — supposed "ultimate reality" (道, Being, etc.) — but whenever we try to speak of it, it becomes 第二实在

**3. Types of 形而上 (metaphysical formation):**
- **Type 0**: Recognition of sameness across time/change (the apple remains "the same apple"; the concept "apple" from many apples)
- **Type 1**: Prediction from experience (apples will continue to fall from trees)
- **Type 2**: Abstraction from experience (the concept "integrity" from repeated behaviors)
- **Type 3**: Combination of abstractions into frameworks and values

**4. The 道德仁义礼 inversion (crucial illustration):**
The Daoist hierarchy appears to show: 道 → 德 → 仁 → 义 → 礼 (道 generates all)

But actually: 现象礼 → "现象仁/义" (as interpretation) → 德 (as generalized property) → 道 (as meta-principle)

The *actual* derivation is from phenomena upward, but we *understand* it as top-down. This inversion is the core structure of traditional metaphysics — and its error.

**5. 前形而上学 vs 形而上学 (Chinese distinction):**
Chinese philosophy has 形而上 (metaphysical content) but little 形而上学 (study of metaphysics). Chinese thought operates *within* given frameworks toward 至善/修身, whereas Western metaphysics pursues 终极实在 (ultimate reality) as such.

**6. Nihilism as absence, not thesis:**
When "ultimate reality" fails, metaphysics collapses. Nihilism is not a positive position but an absence — like void is not created, it's just what's left when nothing is there.

**7. The non-rational (非理性) is foundational:**
- Rational aims must be outside rationality (analytic truth about "aims")
- The pursuit of 恒常 (constancy/permanence) is non-rational — we need stable patterns to act meaningfully
- This non-rationality should be *acknowledged*, not eliminated
- Its function: overlapping ideal and phenomena — **practice** (实践)
- Deeper layer: "self-realization" (自我实现) — seeing ourselves in phenomena, proving our existence

**8. Post-metaphysics (后形而上学):**
- Comes *after* nihilism
- Recognizes all 形而上 as constructions on phenomena
- "Disenchants" (祛魅) 第〇实在 — value, meaning, essence are non-rational pursuits, not discoveries
- 现象 now occupies the special position
- Acknowledges non-rationality's existence and effects
- Has functional purpose: 理想和现象之重叠 — practice

**Key terms for translation:**
- 现象 — phenomena (phenomenological sense)
- 第一/二/〇实在 — First/Second/Zeroth Reality (author's coinages)
- 前/后形而上学 — pre-/post-metaphysics
- 恒常 — constancy, permanence
- 非理性 — the non-rational
- 祛魅 — disenchantment (Weberian term in Chinese)
- 终极实在 — ultimate reality
- 自我实现 — self-realization

**Chinese philosophy connections:**

*On the 道德仁义礼 analysis:*
- This is a provocative reading — not exegesis of Laozi but using the structure to illustrate the inversion
- The author explicitly notes Chinese philosophy has 形而上 without much 形而上学
- The emphasis on 修身 over metaphysical investigation is acknowledged

*Practice (实践):*
- The centering of practice resonates with Neo-Confucian 工夫論 (theory of moral effort)
- But the framework is different — practice here overlaps ideal/phenomena, not cultivation toward transcendent pattern (理)

*Non-rationality:*
- The acceptance of 非理性 parallels Daoist suspicion of purely rational knowing (知 vs 明)
- But unlike Zhuangzi, this isn't skepticism — it's acknowledgment of what underlies rational activity

*Phenomenological starting point:*
- Buddhist resonances — direct experience as primary
- But without Buddhist soteriology — no liberation from phenomena

**Notable features:**
- Dense systematic essay with extensive footnotes
- Uses Chinese philosophical vocabulary but builds a different framework
- The 道德仁义礼 example is pedagogically brilliant
- Continues in next essay: 形而上学后的目的：诗意

## Essay 5: 形而上学后的目的：诗意 (The Purpose After Metaphysics: Poiesis)

**Core argument:**
After the disenchantment of metaphysics, meaning/purpose cannot be denied (it's already there as feeling) nor can we be "intoxicated" by it (第〇实在 is disenchanted). The remaining stance is 诗意 — the poetic/poiesis — a lucid engagement with meaning-making.

**Key concepts:**

**1. 梦境 (Dream-realm):**
A metaphor for the "environment" in which meaning/purpose can exist and manifest. Not just sleeping dreams — also games, books, adventures, "small worlds" (小世界), "small freedoms" (小自在).

**2. Meaning ≡ Feeling (两面一体):**
Meaning and purpose are not rational discoveries but sensory/emotional phenomena:
- "感性的涌动" — surging of sensation
- "体验的结晶" — crystallization of experience  
- "情绪的湍流" — turbulence of emotion

Meaning and feeling are "two sides of one body." The dream-realm is the packaging of experience, the environment where purpose can exist.

**3. 沉醉的梦境 (Intoxicated dream-realm) = 信念/信仰:**
When we don't know we're in a dream-realm. Purpose becomes logically groundless (but historically grounded) — the logical origin, unmoved mover, ultimate reality. This is belief/faith.

**4. 清醒的梦境 (Lucid dream-realm) = 诗意:**
Knowing we're in a dream-realm while still fully committing to it. The game example: playing with full engagement *knowing* it's a game. Being clear-eyed (清醒) doesn't mean detachment — lucid dreaming still requires full immersion to receive its core experience.

**5. The inevitability of dream-realms:**
We cannot abandon *all* dream-realms. We *must* embrace some because:
- Feeling pre-exists the concept of "I" (感受在我之概念之先前就已然存在)
- We cannot abandon all feelings until "the very end when nothing remains"
- Dream-realm is just a description of what already exists (feeling/meaning)

**6. 诗意 as post-metaphysical stance:**
After disenchantment:
- We cannot deny meaning (虚妄 — vain/deluded)
- We cannot be intoxicated (第〇实在 is disenchanted)
- The remaining path: treat meaning "as itself" (将感受作为感受本身)
- This is the lucid dream-realm = 诗意

**Key terms for translation:**
- 梦境 — dream-realm (not just sleeping dreams)
- 诗意 — poiesis/the poetic (more than aesthetic — a mode of being)
- 沉醉/清醒 — intoxicated/lucid
- 两面一体 — two sides of one body
- 小世界/小自在 — small world/small freedom
- 虚妄 — vain delusion (虚=empty, 妄=presumptuous)
- 感受 — feeling/sensation (ambiguous: both reception and crystallization)

**Chinese philosophy connections:**

*Zhuangzi's 遊 (wandering/play):*
- The lucid dream-realm echoes 遊 — non-serious seriousness, full engagement without grasping
- The butterfly dream: knowing you're dreaming doesn't collapse the dream
- 齊物論: perspectival engagement without claiming absolute standpoint

*Buddhist 方便 (upāya/skillful means):*
- Using constructs while knowing they're constructs
- The raft metaphor — you still need the raft, but don't mistake it for the shore

*Confucian 禮 (ritual):*
- Deliberate cultivation of meaning through form
- 禮 as "packaging" that makes certain meanings/feelings possible
- The "full investment" despite constructed nature parallels ritual sincerity

*Neo-Confucian 情 (emotion/feeling):*
- Feeling as fundamental to human existence
- The debates about 情's relationship to 性 (nature) — here feeling is primary

**The poiesis concept:**
- Closer to Greek ποίησις (making, bringing-forth) than just "poetry"
- Heidegger's sense of poiesis as unconcealment?
- But with Buddhist/Daoist flavor: knowing the unconcealment is itself a construction

**Notable features:**
- Short, concentrated essay (dated July 2, 2022 — earliest dated piece)
- Uses 虚妄 in author's personal sense (explained in footnote)
- The game example is perfectly chosen — immersive but clearly bounded
- Sets up the concept of 境 that the later essays will develop

## Essay 6: 范畴论与境 整理 (Category Theory and 境, Compiled)

**Core argument:**
A formal framework using category theory to describe the structure of thought/experience (境). Metaphysical concepts are universal properties (terminal/initial objects) in appropriately chosen subcategories of experience.

**Key concepts:**

**1. Why category theory?**
- Knowledge appears as "concepts linked in some form" — i.e., structure
- Category theory is the natural language for describing structure
- Methodological commitment: study the "external" (relational) rather than "internal" (essential)
- Any investigation of internals extends to externals anyway (like defining a word requires using other words)
- The 超越 (transcendent) aspect is in *dynamics* — studying structure's evolution = studying how things enter thought

**2. Category theory basics (provided for reader):**
- Category = objects + morphisms (with identity, composition, associativity)
- Universal properties = initial objects (arrows from) or terminal objects (arrows to)
- Magic book examples: animals as objects, transformation spells as morphisms; sheep as terminal object (everything can become sheep)

**3. Tower structure (塔式结构):**
- Recursive construction: morphisms at level n become objects at level n+1
- Meta-order: absolute (which level in construction) and relative (distance from a reference object)
- A "cornerstone" (基石) object serves as reference for relative meta-order

**4. P and E:**
- **𝔓 (P)** = phenomena, the totality of 感受 (sensation/experience) — the "first reality"
- **𝔭** = a part of P (e.g., "all information received from my phone")
- **𝔼/ℰ (E)** = structure *on* P, specifically 境 (the "dream-realm" from previous essay)
  - E = Enclosed (internal), Emotion, Experience
  - Objects of ℰ = selected parts of 𝔓 (experiences)
  - Morphisms of ℰ = 联想 (associations) between experiences — also parts of 𝔓
- Because morphisms are also experiences, **ℰ is a tower structure**
- ℰ can be verified through introspection — the structure serves as a "map" to awaken specific experiences

**5. 形而上 (metaphysical objects) as universal properties:**
> A 形而上 m is an association (morphism) in ℰ that is a universal property in some subcategory ℰ_m = ℳ.

Example: "pen" (笔)
- I see pencil and think of steel pen (association/morphism)
- Similar objects (crayon, chalk) form a subcategory
- The "ultimate association" — the terminal object — is the feeling I get when seeing any pen-like thing
- This feeling = the concept "pen" = the 形而上 of particular pens

**6. The Ship of Theseus:**
- If P = physical world, and morphisms = containment relations, then:
  - Initial object = complete ship (contains all parts)
  - Terminal object = empty (contained by all)
  - → Paradox: essence of ship = nothing
- Solution: P should be phenomena, not physical world
- The 形而上 "Ship of Theseus" exists in our minds, not in physical world

**7. "What is a person?"**
- "人" = the feeling you get when seeing anything you consider human
- That feeling tells you what "human" is
- To elaborate: explore what's between that feeling and seeing particular humans (hands, face, sociality...)
- This is a *practical* answer, not ontological — it's all we can do when a child asks "what is a person?"

**8. Meta-order is construction-dependent:**
- ℰ describes structure on 𝔭, not how 𝔭 was generated
- Same objects can have different meta-orders depending on construction/perspective
- Dragon's blood example:
  - For John the alchemist: human, dragon, blood are all level 1; human blood, dragon blood are level 2
  - For Luke (never saw dragon hurt): human blood, dragon are level 1; dragon blood is level 2 (deduced)
  - After rebellion: returns to John's structure

**9. Metaphysics = a construction:**
> A metaphysics (形而上学) on ℳ is a construction on ℳ — a way of assigning meta-orders to objects.

- Top-down: cornerstone = universal property (e.g., 道 as initial object generating everything)
- Bottom-up: cornerstone = base phenomena, universal property at highest level (e.g., 礼 → 义 → 仁 → 德 → 道)

**Key terms for translation:**
- 境 — realm/sphere (technical term in this framework)
- 范畴论 — category theory
- 态射 — morphism
- 泛性质 — universal property
- 始对象/终对象 — initial/terminal object
- 塔式结构 — tower structure
- 元阶 — meta-order
- 基石 — cornerstone (reference object for relative meta-order)
- 联想 — association (the morphisms of ℰ)
- 形而上学 — metaphysics (here: a specific construction on a 境)

**Chinese philosophy connections:**

*The 道德仁义礼 examples:*
- Revisits 后形而上学's analysis now with formal apparatus
- Top-down: 道 as initial object, generating 德 → 仁 → 义 → 礼
- Bottom-up: 礼 (observed) → 义 (pattern) → 仁 (human nature) → 德 (all natures) → 道 (source)
- The formal framework captures the "inversion" insight precisely

*境 as technical term:*
- Draws on Buddhist 境 (object of perception, sense-sphere)
- Also aesthetic 意境 (artistic conception, the "world" of a work)
- The E = Enclosed, Emotion, Experience — captures the lived-experiential dimension

*Perspectivalism formalized:*
- Different constructions = different meta-order assignments = different perspectives
- No single "correct" meta-order — depends on what cornerstones you choose
- This resonates with Zhuangzi's relativism of perspectives

*Introspection as verification:*
- The structure ℰ can be "verified through introspection"
- Resonates with Neo-Confucian 內省 (inner reflection)
- But here it's structural verification, not moral cultivation

**Notable features:**
- Heavy use of mathematical notation (LaTeX)
- Magic book examples throughout — pedagogically effective
- The "arrows-only metacategory" note suggests technical sophistication
- Continues in 范畴论与境：K1策略

## Essay 7: 范畴论与境：K1策略 (Category Theory and 境: K1 Strategy)

**Core argument:**
Using the category-theoretic framework of 境 to analyze: (1) stable structures preserved across the evolution of experience, (2) how knowledge arises through language games, (3) what "understanding" means as a natural transformation between structural evolution and experiential evolution.

**Key concepts:**

**1. K1 Form — Functors:**
- **Evolution functor**: T_t: 𝔼_t → 𝔼_{t+1} (境's evolution over "time" — not necessarily physical time)
- **Embedding functors**: (F_{E,L})_t: (ℰ_L)_t → 𝔼_t (language subcategory into full 境)
- **Transformation functors**: (F_{L→M})_t: (ℰ_L)_t → (ℰ_M)_t (between different subcategories)
- **Cross-evolution categories**: (F_L)_t: (ℰ_L)_t → ℰ_L (embedding into "universal" language category)

**2. Stable structures (S_E):**
- In the evolution T, some structure S_E is preserved across all 𝔼_t
- If 𝔼_{t_c} is the minimal/earliest, then S_{E_c} might be "innate cognitive structure" (先天認知結構)
- Through functors from language/math to 𝔼, we can study S_L/S_M to approximate S_E:
  - (F_{E,L})_t(S_L) ≈ S_E
- Multiple formal systems can triangulate toward S_E: {(F_{E,i})_t(S_i)}_i

**3. Genesis of knowledge:**
- Knowledge category (ℰ_K)_t: objects = beliefs, morphisms = justification relations
- Functor (F_{L→K})_t: sentences → beliefs
- Process:
  1. Language game creates new sentence a in (ℰ_L)_t
  2. Introspection maps it to a belief via (F_{L→K})_t
  3. Attempt to integrate into knowledge network
  4. Accept/reject based on stable structure S_K
  5. Either way, (ℰ_K)_t evolves to (ℰ_K)_{t'}
- "Knowledge occurs" when a-corresponding-belief becomes an object in (ℰ_K)_{t'}

**4. Natural transformations — the key technical tool:**

For math category (ℰ_M)_t, compare two paths to 𝔼_{t+1}:
- Path 1: (ℰ_M)_t →[embed]→ 𝔼_t →[T]→ 𝔼_{t+1}
- Path 2: (ℰ_M)_t →[T_M]→ (ℰ_M)_{t+1} →[embed]→ 𝔼_{t+1}

Natural transformation requires: T ∘ (F_{E,M})_t ⇒ (F_{E,M})_{t+1} ∘ T_M

For each formula a, there's a morphism η_a connecting these two paths.

**5. η_a as "confirmation experience":**
- Example: a = "1+1", T_M(a) = "1+1=2"
- Left side: thinking about "1+1", then evolving
- Right side: seeing "1+1=2" directly
- **η_a is the experience of confirming your thinking matches the result** — like checking your answer against the answer key

**When η_a is identity**: "mastery" (掌握) — your thinking and the result feel identical without any confirmation process needed. "Direct confirmation sense."

**6. Naturality condition interpreted:**
- If f: a → a' is a reversible derivation you can stably reproduce mentally, and you've mastered a', then mastering a requires:
  1. Derive a → a' in your mind
  2. Instantly recognize a' is correct
  3. Derive back a' → a
- If this process can't produce "direct confirmation sense" for a, naturality fails

**7. Understanding as natural transformation:**
> When you see something and feel you understand it, this means a natural transformation is established between the thing's structural evolution and your own experiential evolution.

Example: "Cat jumps on table"
- Language structure evolves (subject-verb-object unfolding)
- You mentally simulate: cat moves, leaps, lands
- **When these align → "I understand"**
- The mental process **is** the meaning

Counter-example: "你有这么高速运转的机械进入中国" (meme sentence)
- Cannot align grammatically → no understanding
- But if you learn the meme context → can align via cultural category → "I get it"

**"I understand" is not ontological confirmation of the sentence, but experiential confirmation of η — the alignment.**

**8. When we "feel" others' feelings:**
When I recognize "this couple truly loves each other" — I don't perceive some substance "love." Rather, their interactions "resonate" with my experiences and patterns, leading me to/creating the feeling of "love" in my mind.

**9. KA Conjecture (sketched):**
- Stable structures might be subcategories with universal properties
- The feeling of "completeness" (T) — when a discourse reaches its terminal object
- "Tension" — when no unique terminal object exists (like "save your partner or parents?")
- Language evolution = continually seeking T
- Why philosophy continues = in some areas, we can't construct a universal property to achieve T
- Children more easily achieve T (simpler 𝔼); adults have more complex structures, more tension

**10. Methodological implications:**
1. Use formal categories to study less accessible ones (this is what language games already do — now we have structural description)
2. Interpret category theory results as philosophical claims
3. Objects/morphisms in 𝔼 are experiences — accessible via introspection
4. **"Philosophical experiments"**: construct examples with specific structures to awaken specific experiences; if reproducible across readers → empirical verification
5. Cross-cultural/developmental studies: which structures can be induced in which populations?

**11. Final reflection:**
- This framework = one tool among many
- Poetry, art, music, games, cooking, travel, memes — all construct 境, awaken experiences through structure
- "You have already made the choice. You are here to try to understand why and how you made it."
- We're always already constructing 境; sometimes unaware of how
- Category theory is scaffolding; the practice is universal

**Key terms for translation:**
- 函子 — functor
- 自然变换 — natural transformation
- η_a — confirmation/alignment morphism
- 掌握 — mastery (when η_a = identity)
- 稳定结构 — stable structure
- 先天认知结构 — innate cognitive structure
- 知识的发生 — genesis of knowledge
- 完满 — completeness (terminal object feeling)
- 张力 — tension (no unique terminal object)
- 哲学实验 — philosophical experiment

**Chinese philosophy connections:**

*感應 (resonance, mutual response):*
- The η alignment experience is structurally similar to 感應 — the Neo-Confucian concept of resonance between mind and things
- Understanding as alignment rather than grasping essence fits Chinese relational ontology

*致知 (extending knowledge):*
- The knowledge-genesis section describes a process similar to 格物致知 — investigating things to extend knowledge
- But here formalized through category-theoretic evolution

*Introspection as verification:*
- Traditional Chinese philosophy relies heavily on introspection (反省, 内省)
- This framework justifies introspection structurally — 𝔼 objects are experiences, verifiable internally

*Relations over substances:*
- Chinese philosophy emphasizes 關係 (relationships) over isolated substances
- This framework makes relationships (morphisms) primary; "essence" is just universal property in a relational structure

*詩意 revisited:*
- The essay ends by inviting re-reading of 形而上学后的目的：诗意
- The 境 concept from that essay is now formally elaborated
- Poiesis = constructing 境 with awareness

**Notable features:**
- Most technically dense essay; warns readers to skip difficult parts
- Written quickly to record ideas (acknowledged rough edges)
- Contains substantial "Todo" sections with future directions
- The "KA Conjecture" section is programmatic/speculative
- Matrix quote ("You have already made the choice") — pop culture reference
- Explicitly invites re-reading earlier essay with new framework

## Appendix: 关于诗意和境的一些零散想法 (Scattered Thoughts on Poiesis and 境)

**Nature:** Collection of shorter reflections, extensions, and draft ideas supplementing the main essays.

**Key reflections:**

**1. Human limitation as creative opportunity:**
Being unable to access "reality behind phenomena" isn't tragedy. Who laments that novels can only use language? Through this "limitation":
- Three-color displays show vivid images (because we don't perceive every EM frequency)
- 12-tone equal temperament enables music impossible in pure tuning (because we have pitch perception fuzziness)
- A single novel gains multiple interpretations across times and peoples

**2. Post-metaphysics as structural rather than dependent:**
Analogy: 御史台 (Censorate) vs 廉政公署 (ICAC)
- Pre-metaphysics = Censorate — needs emperor to function
- Post-metaphysics = ICAC — functions through structural position
The latter is more effective in practice; people can actively construct and evolve its functions.

**3. Coin-flipping as 诗意:**
To discover what you truly want through coin-flipping, you must *genuinely believe* you'll follow the result. If you don't care about the result, the strategy fails.
- This is 诗意: constructing a 境 (question-answer context)
- Knowing it's constructed, yet still taking it seriously to gain insight
- Same with "answer books" — opening to a random page for guidance

**4. Self-fulfilling prophecy as 境 construction:**
Prophecies that come true are often guidance — they construct a 境, and through evolution, reach a result that feels like "fulfillment."

**5. On death:**
- We never discussed death in the main text
- One's own death is 超越性 (transcendent) — cannot be reached
- "Living toward death" (Heidegger) is impossible — the "death" you're living-toward is your *conception* of death, which varies by metaphysical framework
- Therefore: we can't care about life's *purpose* (which would be outside life); we can only care about life's *process* and its feelings
- Self-propelling through 境 construction: from current self, through practice, to new self — not for external telos, but based on present self, transcending present self

**6. On category theory (re-emphasis):**
Category theory is just one tool — a personal choice based on intuition and interest. Many tools exist:
- Logic propositions to poetic imagery
- Scientific theories to artistic aesthetics
- Each has strengths and weaknesses

**The key insight**: We are *already* constantly constructing 境:
- Concepts: "forest," "road," "credit," "floating currency," "nation"
- Systems: academic papers, citation systems, tenure, education, exams
- Art: Renaissance sculptures to cinema
- Daily life: arranging desks, taking sunset photos, decorating bedrooms, choosing clothes

> "We are creators, poets of our own life and experience... Nothingness cannot stop us, because we and our hands already exist; the past cannot stop us, because we can only walk toward the future."

**7. Two questions addressed:**
1. **How is philosophy possible?** Must philosophy relate to human practice? How does it return to practice?
2. **How is meaning possible?** Regardless of whether noumena exist, how does meaning enter our horizon or occur within it?

The second might be another Kantian question — "what is the meaning of X" might be synthetic a priori knowledge. We've tried to describe this synthesis through the 境 framework.

**8. Favorite quotes:**
- 孟子: "非独贤者有是心也，人皆有之" (Not only the worthy have this mind; all people have it)
- Socrates (Apology): "such wisdom as is attainable by man" — the author identifies with this epistemic humility

**9. Draft ideas (incomplete):**
- **Ultimate reality structure**: 0-meta-order object → morphisms from itself to itself (like "unmoved mover")
- **Aesthetics**: Constructing artworks to awaken experiences, trying to reach universal S_E about "beauty"
- **Grounding legitimacy**: Kant grounded empirical science; this framework grounds "poetic experience and philosophy"?

**10. Problems claimed as dissolved/addressed:**
- Collective interest definition
- Knowledge definition
- Absurdism
- Kantian questions
- Existentialism
- Definition of "human" (in practice)
- Ship of Theseus
- Objectification/alienation
- Language: structure vs meaning priority
- What is understanding
- Meno's paradox
- Eastern philosophy "awakening"
- Philosophy's operability
- Intersubjectivity

**Key terms for translation:**
- 诗意 — poiesis (now fully elaborated through the collection)
- 御史台/廉政公署 — Censorate/ICAC (structural analogy)
- 自己推动自己 — self-propelling
- 超越性 — transcendence

**Chinese philosophy connections:**

*The Mencius quote:*
- 人皆有之 — universality of moral capacity
- The author identifies with this democratic epistemology

*Self-cultivation through practice:*
- The "from self to self through practice" echoes Confucian 修身
- But without predetermined endpoint (不是为了某种我之外的超越性)

*Already doing philosophy:*
- Resonates with Wittgenstein's "the work of philosophy is... assembling reminders for a particular purpose"
- We're already constructing 境; philosophy clarifies what we're already doing

**Notable features:**
- Contains embedded images (memes about constructing categories from phenomena)
- Has "draft" sections with speculative ideas
- Lists philosophical problems as "solved" — ambitious claim
- Personal, reflective tone compared to technical main essays
- Ends with sense of affirmation: we are already poets of our experience

## Second Reading: Critical Notes

### On Essay 1 (Collective Interest)

**The individualist starting point:**
The author's claim that "人类个体必然只能从人类个体出发，而回到人类个体本身" imports a Western liberal ontology. In Confucian thought, the self is constituted *through* relationships (五倫) — the self doesn't exist prior to relations, then extend outward. The 重整化 metaphor (collective as emergent from individuals) naturalizes this individualism without defending it.

**Empathy (共情) vs 感應:**
The author grounds inter-personal understanding in shared individual existence. But Confucian 仁 isn't projection from self to other — it's responsiveness (感應) arising from already being in relationship. Mencius's 四端 are innate moral responsiveness, not empathic projection.

### On Essay 3 (Sisyphus and Cat)

**The cat and 無為:**
The cat example beautifully evokes Zhuangzi — meaning immanent in purposeless activity. But critical question: Is cat-care really non-transcendent? When the cat dies, does the absurd arrive? Buddhist critique: even cat-attachment is attachment (執).

**Alienation vs Confucian/Daoist diagnoses:**
The Marxist framework (異化) is one diagnosis. Alternatives:
- Confucian: The problem is failure of rectification (正名) — the worker's work isn't their calling (職分)
- Daoist: The problem is having goals at all (有為)
- Buddhist: Both absurd feeling and cat-care satisfaction are within saṃsāra

### On Essay 4 (Post-Metaphysics) — The 道德仁義禮 Analysis

**Is this fair to Confucianism?**
The author treats the hierarchy as structural illustration, not exegesis. But even so:

*仁 as felt reality:* The author's "現象仁" (subjective feeling toward father) may be too subjectivist. In Confucian thought, 仁 isn't just feeling — it's real moral orientation. Mencius's 四端 are sprouts of genuine moral reality, not projections.

*義 as motivation:* The author conflates 義 with 推動力 (motivation). But 義 is rightness/fittingness — what *ought* to be done, not what one is *moved* to do. This misses the normative dimension.

*Direction of derivation:* The author argues 禮(observed) → 仁/義(interpretation) → 德 → 道. Confucianism might say: 仁 is real (as moral nature), 義 is its appropriate expression, 禮 is cultural form. The author may be right about epistemology (how we learn concepts) but wrong about ontology (what's real).

**The 掩埋不見 (burial) critique:**
Powerful observation that the phenomenal derivation gets "buried." But it could be turned around: maybe the burial is meaningful. 禮 that merely expresses subjective feeling isn't real 禮 — it lacks normative force.

### On Essay 5 (Poiesis)

**诗意 and 方便:**
The "lucid dream-realm" resembles Buddhist 方便 (skillful means) — using constructs knowingly. But 方便 is soteriological — it aims at liberation. The author's 诗意 seems to stay within the dream-realm rather than pointing beyond.

**The inevitability of 梦境:**
"We cannot abandon all dream-realms because feeling pre-exists the self." This resonates with 唯識 (consciousness-only). But the Buddhist would say: this is exactly what needs to be transformed (轉識成智), not just acknowledged.

### On Essays 6-7 (Category Theory)

**Does formalization capture or lose?**
Can mathematical categories capture the felt quality (受) of experience? Is the η (alignment experience) really accessible introspectively, or is this post-hoc rationalization?

**Universal properties as 本質:**
Elegant claim that 形而上 concepts are terminal/initial objects. But the Daoist would ask: isn't defining 本質 this way just another way of grasping?

### Overall Critical Assessment

**What the framework does well:**
1. Takes phenomena seriously as starting point (resonates with Buddhist/phenomenological traditions)
2. Acknowledges non-rationality without dismissing it
3. Recovers meaning-making without naive metaphysics
4. The 诗意 concept elegantly captures engaged-yet-aware stance

**What it might miss:**

1. **The relational self:** Chinese philosophy doesn't start with individual experience. The self is constituted through relationships. The framework is individual-centric despite using Chinese vocabulary.

2. **Normative dimension:** The framework is descriptive ("this is how meaning works") but Chinese philosophy is usually normative ("this is how one should cultivate"). The author explicitly avoids normative claims.

3. **Transformation/liberation:** Buddhist and Daoist thought aim at transformation. The author's stance stays within 境 rather than pointing beyond. Is this acceptance or resignation?

4. **Cosmic dimension:** No 天, no 天理, no 天命. The framework is entirely human-constructed. This might miss something Chinese philosophy affirms — that humans participate in a larger order.

5. **Historical dimension:** The essays don't address how 境 changes across history and traditions. Chinese philosophy is deeply historical (道統, 傳承).

**A constructive reading:**
The author is doing philosophy *with* Chinese materials, not *within* Chinese traditions. This is legitimate. The framework illuminates aspects of Chinese philosophy (perspectivalism, practice-theory, phenomenological emphasis) without being reducible to any classical school.
