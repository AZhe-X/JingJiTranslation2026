# Translation Dictionary: Philosophy of Mind & Cognitive Science Considerations

This dictionary provides translation recommendations for key terms in the jing-collection, with specific attention to their implications for philosophy of mind and cognitive science.

## 境 (jing)

- **Main translation**: E / experiential-field / cognitive-scape
- **Alternatives**:
  - "E" (formal technical usage, as the author uses)
  - "experiential-field" or "cognitive-scape" (discursive contexts)
  - "realm" (too static, misses dynamic nature)
  - "state" (too momentary, misses structural aspect)
  - "milieu" (captures embedding but not categorical structure)
- **Note**: This is the core cognitive architecture term. In philosophy of mind, 境 represents a category-theoretic model of phenomenal consciousness where objects are experiences (感受) and morphisms are associations (联想). It bridges structural functionalism (concepts defined by relational position) and phenomenology (grounded in lived experience). The term captures both a bounded cognitive space and a state of consciousness, similar to "horizon of understanding" in Husserlian phenomenology. Unlike mental states (too atomistic) or cognitive frames (too rigid), 境 emphasizes composability and evolution. In cognitive science terms, it models working memory's selective attention over a vast phenomenal field P, plus the associative network binding selected elements. The tower structure (塔式结构) of 境 provides a formal model for meta-cognition and higher-order thought.

## 联想 (lianxiang)

- **Main translation**: association / cognitive morphism
- **Alternatives**:
  - "association" (standard cognitive science term)
  - "cognitive morphism" (technical category-theoretic usage)
  - "linked-imagining" (literal, captures 联 and 想)
  - "spreading activation" (neurocognitive process term)
  - "associative link" (network theory)
- **Note**: In this framework, 联想 as morphisms are the fundamental unit of cognition. Unlike classical associationism (Hume, Locke) which treats associations as mere pairings, the category-theoretic formulation adds composability (if A associates to B and B to C, there's a determinate A-to-C association) and identity (each experience associates to itself). This transforms "association of ideas" into a precise algebraic structure. In cognitive science, this relates to spreading activation in semantic networks, but with added structural constraints. The morphisms model not just which concepts co-activate, but how chains of thought compose lawfully. In philosophy of mind, this places relations between experiences as more fundamental than experiences themselves, resonating with William James's radical empiricism (relations are themselves experienced) and process philosophy. The choice makes 境 an arrows-only metacategory: the distinction between "a concept" and "an association between concepts" collapses at the fundamental level.

---

## 感受 (ganshou)

- **Main translation**: lived experience / phenomenal experience
- **Alternatives**:
  - "lived experience" (Erlebnis in phenomenology, closest match)
  - "feeling-experience" (captures both feeling and undergoing)
  - "qualitative experience" (philosophy of mind standard)
  - "sensation" (too sensory-specific)
  - "feeling" (too affective)
  - "experience" (too generic)
- **Note**: 感受 implies both receptivity (感, sensing/receiving) and undergoing (受, bearing/suffering), capturing the passive and active dimensions of consciousness. In philosophy of mind, this corresponds to phenomenal character or qualia, but without commitments to intrinsic properties. The framework treats 感受 as objects in category 境, meaning they're defined structurally by associative position rather than by intrinsic nature. This sidesteps the hard problem of consciousness in its traditional form. In cognitive science, 感受 maps to phenomenal contents in global workspace theory or integrated information theory, but emphasizes experiential rather than computational characterization. The term bridges first-person phenomenology and third-person cognitive architecture: experiences are private qualia from within, but publicly characterized by structural position from without.

---

## 意识 (yishi)

- **Main translation**: consciousness / awareness
- **Alternatives**:
  - "consciousness" (when referring to phenomenal consciousness)
  - "awareness" (when emphasizing attentional aspect)
  - "cognition" (when emphasizing cognitive processing, though see 认知)
- **Note**: In the framework, consciousness is not treated as a separate mystery but as the phenomenal field P from which 境 structures are constructed. This aligns with phenomenal consciousness (what-it's-like-ness) rather than access consciousness or self-consciousness per se. The approach is closer to Chalmers's distinction: consciousness is the "first reality" (第一实在), the given phenomenal field, while cognitive architecture 境 is constructed upon it. The framework avoids treating consciousness as a property that states have or lack, instead treating it as the ambient space within which cognitive structures exist. This resonates with neutral monism and Russellian monism in philosophy of mind. For cognitive science, this suggests consciousness is not generated by information processing but is the medium in which information-processing structures (associations, concepts) are embedded.

---

## 认知 (renzhi)

- **Main translation**: cognition / cognitive structure
- **Alternatives**:
  - "cognition" (general usage)
  - "cognitive structure" (when emphasizing 境 architecture)
  - "epistemic structure" (when knowledge-focused)
  - "understanding" (in some contexts, see 理解)
- **Note**: The framework makes a crucial distinction: 意识 is the phenomenal field (consciousness), while 认知 is the category-theoretic structure 境 built upon it. Cognition is not computational symbol manipulation but structural organization of phenomenal experience via associations. This aligns with embodied cognition and enactivism: cognition emerges from organizing experience, not from abstract symbol processing. In philosophy of mind, this resolves the explanatory gap differently than functionalism: cognitive states are individuated by structural position in 境, not by causal-functional roles in physical systems. The stable structures S_E of 境 that persist through evolution are candidates for innate cognitive architecture (Kantian categories, Chomskyan deep structure, Spelke's core knowledge). Cognitive development is modeled as functor T: E_t → E_{t+1}, with learning as expansion of associative network while preserving stable structures.

---

## 体验 (tiyan)

- **Main translation**: experience / experiential content
- **Alternatives**:
  - "experience" (general usage, slightly broader than 感受)
  - "experiential content" (emphasizing content aspect)
  - "undergoing" (emphasizing process)
  - "phenomenal episode" (technical)
- **Note**: 体验 and 感受 are used somewhat interchangeably for phenomenal contents, but 体验 emphasizes the durational or episodic character. In philosophy of mind, this maps to token experiences (particular phenomenal episodes) as opposed to experience types. The framework's innovation is treating 体验/感受 as both objects (things experienced) and morphisms (associative experiences are themselves experienced). This dual role is formalized in the arrows-only metacategory: the experience of "pencil reminds me of pen" is not ontologically different from the experience of "pencil" itself; both are objects, but one plays an identity-morphism role while the other plays a relational-morphism role. For cognitive science, this models how meta-cognitive experiences (thinking about thoughts) are not categorically different from first-order experiences, explaining the phenomenological continuity of consciousness across reflective levels.

---

## 经验 (jingyan)

- **Main translation**: experience (broader sense) / empirical experience
- **Alternatives**:
  - "experience" (as opposed to innate or a priori)
  - "empirical experience" (emphasizing posteriority)
  - "experiential history" (diachronic emphasis)
- **Note**: While 体验/感受 refer to phenomenal contents as objects in 境, 经验 refers to accumulated experience over time or experience in the epistemological sense (a posteriori vs. a priori). In the framework's discussion of stable structures S_{E_c}, 经验 marks the boundary: structures present before any 经验 are candidates for a priori cognitive structures. This engages directly with nativism debates in cognitive science. For philosophy of mind, this connects to the Kantian project: what are the conditions of possibility for experience (经验) to occur? The framework suggests these conditions are stable structures S_E in the cognitive category. Note the Chinese philosophical resonance: 境界 (jing-jie, "horizon/level of attainment") is often about depth of 经验, paralleling the framework's idea that 境 evolves through experience.

## 构造 (gouzao)

- **Main translation**: construction / structuring
- **Alternatives**:
  - "construction" (when emphasizing generative aspect)
  - "structuring" (when emphasizing organization)
  - "composition" (categorical sense)
  - "synthesis" (Kantian sense)
- **Note**: Critical term for understanding the framework's post-metaphysical stance. 境 is not discovered but constructed from P: we select certain experiences as objects and certain associations as morphisms. This is cognitive construction, not arbitrary construction. In philosophy of mind, this aligns with constructivism about mental representation: cognitive structures are not mirrors of external reality but organized responses to phenomenal input. The tower construction (塔式构造) formalizes how meta-cognitive levels are built up. The framework distinguishes descriptive vs. generative construction: 境 as structure is descriptive (describes how P is organized in experience) not generative (境 doesn't generate P). This parallels Kant: we construct empirical objects from phenomenal manifold, but don't construct the manifold itself. For cognitive science, this suggests developmental psychology is the study of construction processes: how children build increasingly complex E structures from phenomenal input.

---

## 我 (wo)

- **Main translation**: self / I
- **Alternatives**:
  - "self" (philosophical usage)
  - "I" (first-person pronoun)
  - "ego" (psychoanalytic, usually avoid)
- **Note**: Profound implications for philosophy of mind. The framework defines "我" as a universal property (terminal object) in a subcategory of 境: "我" is that experience which all experiences "about me" associate to. This provides a structural, non-substantialist account of self. The self is not a Cartesian substance or a Humean bundle, but a functional node in the experiential network. This aligns with Buddhist Abhidharma analysis (self as conventional designation over aggregates) and with narrative self theories (Dennett, Schechtman). For cognitive science, this explains self-recognition: to recognize something as "mine" is for that experience to associate to the "我" terminal object. The framework can model how objects become part of the extended self (body, possessions, creations) by entering the "我" subcategory. This also explains disorders of self: disruptions to the "我" universal property (e.g., in schizophrenia, depersonalization). The dynamic nature of 境 means the self evolves: the "我" of E_t differs from the "我" of E_{t+1}, yet there's continuity through stable structures.

---

## 自我 (ziwo)

- **Main translation**: self (reflexive/philosophical)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "self" (when emphasizing philosophical entity)
  - "ego" (in psychoanalytic contexts)
  - "self-identity"
- **Note**: While 我 is the first-person pronoun/experiencer, 自我 is the reflective, thematized self. In the framework's meta-cognitive tower structure, 自我 emerges at T_1 or higher: it's the experience of oneself as object of reflection. This maps to Higher-Order Thought theories: 自我 requires meta-representation (representing oneself as oneself). The framework can distinguish: (1) pre-reflective self (我 as lived experiencer), (2) reflective self (自我 as object of thought), (3) narrative self (the constructed life-story self). For cognitive science, this explains development of self-consciousness: children first have 我 (phenomenal perspective) before developing 自我 (self-concept), aligning with mirror self-recognition studies. The category-theoretic formulation allows formal analysis: 自我 is a higher-order object whose associations include meta-cognitive morphisms. This can model phenomena like self-deception (conflicts between 我-level and 自我-level associations) or self-cultivation (deliberately reconstructing the 自我 subcategory).

---

## 梦境 (mengjing)

- **Main translation**: dreamscape / experiential milieu / meaning-field
- **Alternatives**:
  - "experiential milieu" (captures immersive context)
  - "meaning-field" (emphasizes semantic dimension)
  - "horizon" (phenomenological sense)
  - "dreamscape" (too literal, but preserves 境)
  - "immersive context" (functional description)
- **Note**: The author uses 梦境 not just for literal dreams but for structured environments in which meaning arises. In philosophy of mind, this is close to Heidegger's "world" (Welt): not a collection of objects but a meaning-totality in which things show up as significant. The framework treats 梦境 as a particular construction of 境, often deliberately constructed to evoke specific experiences. This is central to the "poetic stance" (诗意): entering a 梦境 while knowing it's constructed. For cognitive science, 梦境 models context-dependent processing: the same stimulus evokes different responses in different 梦境. This explains phenomena like frame effects, priming, and emotional context. The lucid-dream analogy is apt: in lucid dreaming, you know you're dreaming yet remain immersed; in poetic stance, you know the meaning-field is constructed yet fully engage. This has implications for therapy (constructing therapeutic 梦境), education (creating learning contexts as 梦境), and art (artworks as constructed 梦境 to evoke specific experiences).

---

## 清醒 (qingxing)

- **Main translation**: lucid / lucid awareness / wakefulness
- **Alternatives**:
  - "lucid" (in lucid dreaming sense: aware while experiencing)
  - "awakened" (Buddhist resonance)
  - "sober" (as opposed to intoxicated by illusion)
  - "clear-sighted"
- **Note**: In the framework, 清醒 marks the post-nihilist condition: awareness that all 境 structures are constructed from phenomenal experience P, not discovered as pre-existing metaphysical truths. This is "lucidity" in the sense of lucid dreaming: knowing you're in a dream while continuing to dream. In philosophy of mind, this is a form of meta-cognitive awareness about the nature of cognition itself. It's not mere skepticism (doubting all structures) but sophisticated engagement (using structures while knowing their constructed nature). For cognitive science, 清醒 might correlate with metacognitive monitoring: the ability to track and evaluate one's own cognitive processes. The framework suggests 清醒 doesn't diminish engagement (you can be fully immersed in a film while knowing it's fictional) but changes its quality (from naive realism to poetic participation). This has implications for understanding contemplative practices: Buddhist "awakening" as recognizing the constructed nature of self and world, while continuing to function within those constructions.

---

## 沉醉 (chenzui)

- **Main translation**: immersion / absorbed engagement / intoxication
- **Alternatives**:
  - "immersion" (experiential absorption)
  - "flow" (Csikszentmihalyi's sense)
  - "enchantment" (re-enchantment vs. disenchantment)
  - "intoxication" (literal meaning, captures loss of critical distance)
- **Note**: 沉醉 is full absorption in an experience or 境, without meta-awareness of its constructed nature. In pre-nihilist metaphysics, 沉醉 was the norm: people were immersed in meaning-systems taken as objective truths. Post-nihilism, 沉醉 becomes problematic (naive immersion) or impossible (disenchantment). The framework proposes 诗意 as transcending this binary: lucid immersion (清醒 + 沉醉). For philosophy of mind, 沉醉 relates to the phenomenology of absorption: loss of self-other distinction, time distortion, effortless attention. This occurs in flow states, aesthetic experience, contemplative states, or simply deep engagement with tasks. Cognitive science studies absorption via attentional mechanisms: 沉醉 involves suppression of metacognitive monitoring and executive control, allowing full cognitive resources to be dedicated to the experiential content. The framework's innovation is not rejecting 沉醉 (which is impossible and undesirable) but contextualizing it: engage fully (沉醉) while retaining awareness of construction (清醒), enabling deliberate construction of meaning-fields rather than passive reception.

## 篮子 (lanzi)

- **Main translation**: basket (metaphor for cognitive accessibility)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "basket" (retain metaphor with explanatory note)
  - "accessible domain" (functional)
  - "cognitive scope" (abstract)
  - "horizon of thinkability" (phenomenological)
- **Note**: Crucial metaphor for cognitive closure and the boundary of thought. The basket is what has been "placed" (phenomenal contents that have entered P): we can only think about what's in the basket. In philosophy of mind, this engages directly with Colin McGinn's cognitive closure thesis: there may be facts forever inaccessible to human cognition, not from contingent limitations but from structural ones. The framework's innovation: while we cannot directly study the "process of placing things in the basket" (this is beyond thought, 超越), we can study what is in the basket and how its contents evolve. This transforms a metaphysical limit into an empirical research program. For cognitive science, the basket models the constraint that cognition operates on phenomenal given P: we can only cognize what appears in consciousness, and what appears is constrained by our sensory-cognitive architecture. This connects to Umwelt theory (von Uexküll): each species has its cognitive basket, its accessible phenomenal world. The framework suggests studying cognitive development as studying how the basket's contents expand: what processes allow new experiences to enter P? This is tractable even if the ultimate "placing" process is opaque.

## 恒常 (hengchang)

- **Main translation**: constancy / invariance / permanence
- **Alternatives**:
  - "constancy" (emphasizing temporal stability)
  - "invariance" (mathematical/structural contexts)
  - "permanence" (metaphysical contexts)
  - "persistence" (diachronic emphasis)
- **Note**: The framework identifies 恒常 as the fundamental drive behind metaphysical thinking and concept formation. We seek constancy amid phenomenal flux: same object through time (identity), same cause producing same effect (causality), same type across instances (universals). In philosophy of mind, this connects to object permanence (Piaget), the binding problem (how transient neural activations constitute persistent objects), and the representational stability required for action planning. The framework's account: universal properties (terminal/initial objects in subcategories of 境) formalize 恒常. The concept "pen" is a terminal object all particular pens associate to, providing constancy across variations. For cognitive science, 恒常-seeking is a fundamental computational principle: the brain extracts invariants from sensory flux (Marr's primal sketch extracts edges, V4 extracts object constancy, hippocampus extracts episodic constancy). The framework contextualizes this: we seek 恒常 because without it, action becomes impossible (no reliable expectations). But post-nihilism recognizes 恒常 structures as constructed invariants, not discovered eternals. The stable structures S_E are those invariants that persist through cognitive evolution—candidates for either innate architecture or deeply learned schemas.

## 掌握 (zhangwo)

- **Main translation**: mastery / command / grasping
- **Alternatives**:
  - "mastery" (emphasizing competence)
  - "command" (control sense)
  - "grasping" (understanding sense, literal "holding in hand")
  - "grasp" (epistemological sense)
- **Note**: Technical term in the natural transformation analysis. 掌握 occurs when η_a (the natural transformation linking internal cognitive processing to external formal structure) is an identity morphism: your internal derivation of "1+1" produces exactly the experience you get from seeing "1+1=2," without discrepancy. This provides a phenomenological characterization of understanding with formal precision. In philosophy of mind, this engages with knowledge-that vs. knowledge-how distinction: 掌握 is not just knowing that 1+1=2 (propositional knowledge) nor just being able to compute (procedural knowledge), but experiencing the identity between internal process and external verification—a form of knowledge-by-acquaintance with the structure itself. For cognitive science, this models the feeling of knowing (FOK) or "aha experience": the qualitative sense of grasping something. The framework explains why some correct computations don't feel like mastery (when η_a ≠ identity) and why mastery persists across contexts (naturality condition ensures mastery survives structural transformations). This has pedagogical implications: teaching for 掌握 requires students to construct natural transformations, not just memorize facts or practice procedures.

---

## 理解 (lijie)

- **Main translation**: understanding / comprehension
- **Alternatives**:
  - "understanding" (general epistemological sense)
  - "comprehension" (slightly more passive than 理解)
  - "grasp" (see 掌握, more active)
- **Note**: The framework provides a revolutionary account of 理解. Understanding is not correspondence between mind and world, but establishment of a natural transformation η between two functorial evolutions: cognitive evolution T and structural evolution T_M (or T_L for language). You understand "1+1=2" when there exists η such that thinking about "1+1" and seeing "1+1=2" align coherently. The naturality condition ensures this alignment is robust: it commutes with further cognitive operations. For philosophy of mind, this resolves debates about the nature of understanding without invoking mysterious "grasping" faculties or reducing to behavioral dispositions. Understanding is a phenomenologically accessible experience (the η morphism is an experience you can introspect) with precise structural characterization (naturality commutation). For cognitive science, this models comprehension as alignment between internal simulation and external structure, resonating with embodied simulation theories (Barsalou, Gallese) but formulated at an abstract, general level. The framework extends to language understanding: comprehending a sentence means constructing natural transformation between linguistic structure evolution and cognitive experience evolution. This explains misunderstanding (failure to construct η) and degrees of understanding (η as non-identity morphism vs. identity). Implications for AI: machine understanding would require constructing analogous natural transformations, not just mapping inputs to outputs.

## 现象 (xianxiang)

- **Main translation**: phenomenon / phenomena / phenomenal given
- **Alternatives**:
  - "phenomenon/phenomena" (standard philosophical term)
  - "phenomenal given" (emphasizing givenness)
  - "appearance" (Kantian sense, but potentially misleading about reality-status)
  - "experiential manifold" (emphasizing multiplicity)
- **Note**: In the framework, 现象 is synonymous with P, the "first reality" (第一实在). This is a radical move in philosophy of mind: phenomenal consciousness is ontologically basic for cognition, not derivative from physical processes or neural computations. 现象 is what we start from, not what we explain. This aligns with neutral monism, Russellian monism, and phenomenological approaches. For cognitive science, this inverts the standard research program: instead of explaining how brain produces phenomenal consciousness, we study how cognitive structures (境) are constructed upon given phenomenal field P. The framework remains neutral on whether P is generated by brain, is identical to brain processes (identity theory), or is metaphysically independent—these are beyond the 境's scope. What matters for cognition is that P is epistemologically prior: all cognitive access is via phenomenal experience. This has methodological implications: introspection becomes a legitimate research tool (neurophenomenology), and first-person reports are data about P, not mere behavioral symptoms. The framework's innovation is showing how to build rigorous cognitive science on phenomenal basis using category theory as formal framework.

---

## 第一实在 (di yi shizai)

- **Main translation**: first reality / primary reality / phenomenal reality
- **Alternatives**:
  - "first reality" (emphasizing primacy)
  - "primary reality" (emphasizing basicness)
  - "phenomenal reality" (emphasizing nature)
  - "immediate givenness" (phenomenological description)
- **Note**: The bedrock ontological commitment of the framework. 第一实在 (P, phenomenal experience) is what we indubitably start from; all else is constructed interpretation. This is not eliminativism about physical world—physical objects are 第二实在, constructed from phenomenal given—but a methodological and epistemic ordering. For philosophy of mind, this is a form of phenomenalism or idealism, but pragmatic rather than metaphysical: we privilege 现象 not because physical world doesn't exist, but because cognition necessarily operates on phenomenal interface. The framework borrows from Buddhist epistemology (direct perception as pramana) and phenomenology (Husserl's epoché brackets existence questions to focus on how things appear). For cognitive science, this means studying cognitive architecture as structures built upon phenomenal contents, using category theory to formalize how P gives rise to 境. This sidesteps the hard problem: rather than explaining why/how phenomenal consciousness exists, we take it as given and study its organization. The framework thereby inverts much cognitive science: not "how does information processing generate consciousness?" but "how do conscious experiences organize into cognitive structures?"

---

## 第二实在 (di er shizai)

- **Main translation**: second reality / constructed reality / interpreted reality
- **Alternatives**:
  - "second reality" (maintaining ordinal structure)
  - "constructed reality" (emphasizing construction)
  - "interpreted reality" (emphasizing interpretation)
  - "objective world model" (functional description)
- **Note**: These are constructed interpretations of phenomenal experience P. Most centrally, the "objective world" of persisting objects is 第二实在: we construct permanent "things" (apples, tables, selves) from flux of phenomenal appearances. In philosophy of mind, this engages with direct vs. indirect realism debates. The framework's position is closer to indirect realism or sense-data theory, but without skeptical worries: 第二实在 constructions are not dubious inferences but necessary cognitive structures. For cognitive science, this models object representation: the visual system constructs object files (Kahneman) or object representations from retinal input flux. More broadly, all conceptual structures, theories, beliefs are 第二实在—constructed organizations of phenomenal base. The framework's innovation is using category theory to formalize construction: 第二实在 are structures (objects, morphisms, universal properties) in category 境 built from pool P. This allows rigorous study of construction processes without eliminating first-person phenomenology. Importantly, "second" doesn't mean derivative in value, only in epistemic/cognitive order: 第二实在 are essential for thought and action, but built upon 第一实在 foundation.

---

## 非理性 (feilixing)

- **Main translation**: non-rational / arational / beyond reason
- **Alternatives**:
  - "non-rational" (outside reason's scope, not opposed to it)
  - "arational" (neither rational nor irrational)
  - "beyond reason" (transcendent but not nonsensical)
  - "meta-rational" (above rational domain)
- **Note**: Critical for understanding the framework's post-metaphysical stance. 非理性 acknowledges that reason's goals must come from beyond reason itself (analytic truth: reason is instrumental, goals are chosen). In philosophy of mind, this engages with Humean theories of motivation and decision theory. The framework recognizes our drive for 恒常 (constancy), for 境-construction, for meaning-making are 非理性—not irrational (contrary to reason) but arational (outside reason's domain). This is crucial for post-nihilism: acknowledging that pursuit of meaning is 非理性 doesn't invalidate it, but contextualizes it. For cognitive science, this connects to affective neuroscience and motivation research: goal-setting involves subcortical systems (amygdala, ventral striatum) that aren't "rational" in deliberative sense, yet provide necessary directionality for cognition. The framework's contribution: by acknowledging the 非理性 ground of rational cognition, we can study cognition without pretending to stand outside it or ground it in metaphysical absolutes. This enables "post-metaphysical" cognitive science: studying cognitive structures (rational) while acknowledging their roots in 非理性 drives (needs for constancy, meaning, understanding). Practical implication: philosophical problems involving ultimate grounds (why anything? what is the purpose?) are 非理性 and thus dissolve as cognitive-structural questions.

---

## 超越 (chaoyue)

- **Main translation**: transcendence / beyond / exceeding
- **Alternatives**:
  - "transcendence" (philosophical sense of going beyond)
  - "beyond" (spatial metaphor)
  - "exceeding" (going past limits)
  - "overcoming" (Nietzschean sense)
- **Note**: The framework distinguishes two senses of 超越. (1) Static transcendence: what's permanently beyond thought's reach (the "placing in basket" process—how contents enter phenomenal field P). This is 超越 in mystical sense: forever inaccessible. (2) Dynamic transcendence: "tomorrow's 境 differs from today's 境." Cognitive evolution means we continually transcend current structures without reaching absolute transcendence. For philosophy of mind, this engages with cognitive closure debates (McGinn) and phenomenological horizons (Husserl: every perception has a horizon of possible further perceptions). The framework's move: static 超越 (ultimate grounds, thing-in-itself) is acknowledged but bracketed as empirically sterile; dynamic 超越 (cognitive development, 境 evolution) becomes the tractable research program. For cognitive science, this models developmental psychology and learning: acquiring new concepts, new languages, new expertise transcends previous cognitive limits while remaining within human cognition's scope. The framework can formalize this: evolution functor T: E_t → E_{t+1} is the mechanism of dynamic transcendence, while the stable structures S_E it preserves ensure continuity through change. Implications: education and therapy are technologies of 超越, enabling construction of new 境 structures that transcend current limitations. The framework thereby makes 超越 operational rather than mystical.

## 范畴 (fanchou)

- **Main translation**: category (category theory) / categories (Kantian sense)
- **Alternatives**:
  - "category" (mathematical category theory sense)
  - "categories" (Kantian categories of understanding)
  - "schema" (cognitive science, when appropriate)
- **Note**: Critical ambiguity that the framework exploits. In technical usage, 范畴 refers to mathematical categories (objects + morphisms). The framework models 境 as a category where objects are experiences and morphisms are associations. But the term resonates with Kant's categories of understanding—innate cognitive structures that make experience possible. The framework suggests these are related: Kantian categories might be formalized as stable structures S_E in the experiential category, specifically the portions present from earliest cognition S_{E_c}. For philosophy of mind, this provides a bridge between formal mathematical structure and traditional epistemology. For cognitive science, this suggests category theory might formalize innate cognitive architecture. The framework can model domain-specific knowledge (E_L for language, E_M for mathematics) as subcategories with inclusion functors, and study their stable structures (analogous to Chomsky's Universal Grammar or Spelke's core knowledge). The dual meaning is productive: mathematical categories provide formal tools to study cognitive categories (structured knowledge domains). The framework's use of category theory is motivated by cognition's compositional, hierarchical nature: thoughts compose (associations compose), have meta-levels (tower structure), and exhibit universal properties (concepts as terminal objects).

## 态射 / 箭头 (taishe / jiantou)

- **Main translation**: morphism / arrow
- **Alternatives**:
  - "morphism" (standard category theory term)
  - "arrow" (alternative category theory term, more intuitive)
  - "mapping" (less technical)
  - "transformation" (emphasizing change aspect)
- **Note**: In category theory, morphisms/arrows are structure-preserving maps between objects. In the 境 framework, morphisms are associations (联想) between experiences. This is profound for philosophy of mind: mental relations are as ontologically basic as mental contents. In fact, in the arrows-only formulation, there's no fundamental distinction: objects are identity morphisms. This resonates with process philosophy (Whitehead: relations are as real as relata) and radical empiricism (James: relations are experienced). For cognitive science, this models associative links in semantic networks, but with added structure: morphisms compose (if A→B and B→C, then A→C exists and is determinate), have identities (A→A), and exhibit universal properties (some experiences/concepts are terminal/initial objects all others map to/from). The framework's use of morphisms formalizes spreading activation and cognitive binding. The tower structure makes morphisms-between-morphisms fundamental to meta-cognition: thinking about associations is represented by morphisms in T_1 whose domain/codomain are morphisms in T_0. This provides category-theoretic formalization of Higher-Order Thought theories. Importantly, morphisms are themselves experiences (感受): the association "pencil reminds me of pen" is something felt/experienced, not an abstract relation.

## 函子 (hanzi)

- **Main translation**: functor
- **Alternatives**:
  - "functor" (standard category theory term, retain in technical contexts)
  - "structural mapping" (less technical explanation)
  - "transformation" (between categories, contextual)
- **Note**: Functors map categories to categories while preserving structure (morphisms, composition, identity). In the framework, functors play several cognitive roles: (1) Evolution functor T: E_t → E_{t+1} models cognitive development/change. (2) Inclusion functors F_{E,L}: E_L → E embed subcategories (language, math) into overall cognition. (3) Translation functors F_{L→M}: E_L → E_M map between domains. For philosophy of mind, functors formalize how knowledge transfers across domains, how cognitive structures evolve while preserving invariants, and how specialized cognitive systems relate to general cognition. For cognitive science, this models domain generality vs. domain specificity: specialized cognitive modules (Fodor) vs. general-purpose architecture. The framework allows both: subcategories E_L, E_M are domain-specific, but functors connect them and track commonalities. The stable structures S_E preserved by evolution functor T are candidates for domain-general cognitive architecture. Functors also model learning transfer: if student masters concept in E_M (math), can it transfer to E_L (language) or E (general reasoning)? This requires functor F_{M→E} that preserves relevant structure. The naturality condition on functors (natural transformations) formalizes what it means for learning to transfer properly. Pedagogical implication: teaching should construct functors between domains, not just impart domain-specific knowledge.

## 自然变换 (ziran bianhua)

- **Main translation**: natural transformation
- **Alternatives**:
  - "natural transformation" (standard category theory term, preserve in technical contexts)
  - "coherent alignment" (conceptual explanation)
  - "structural correspondence" (emphasizing correspondence)
- **Note**: Perhaps the framework's most innovative contribution. A natural transformation η between functors F and G assigns to each object a morphism η_a: F(a) → G(a), commuting with all morphisms. The framework models understanding (理解) as natural transformation between cognitive evolution and external structure evolution. You understand "1+1=2" when your internal thought process (T((F_{E,M})_t(1+1))) aligns with the external mathematical derivation ((F_{E,M})_{t+1}(T_M(1+1→1+1=2))) via experience η that "confirms" the alignment. For philosophy of mind, this is a phenomenological characterization of understanding with mathematical precision: understanding is an experience (η_a is a morphism in 境, hence an experience) of alignment between internal and external processes. The naturality condition ensures understanding is robust: it persists through further cognitive operations. When η_a is identity morphism, this is mastery (掌握): no gap between your derivation and the truth. For cognitive science, this formalizes comprehension as simulation-alignment (your cognitive simulation of a process matches the actual process). This explains why some memorized facts don't feel understood (η_a ≠ identity) and why understanding enables transfer (naturality ensures alignment extends to new contexts). Profound implication: meaning is neither in text/world nor in mind, but in the natural transformation between them. This dissolves nature-of-meaning debates (use theory vs. reference theory) by making meaning a relational achievement.

## 第一实在 vs 第二实在 vs 第〇实在

- **Main translation**: First Reality vs. Second Reality vs. Zeroth Reality
- **Note on ordering**: The framework uses a deliberate numerical ordering to establish epistemic and cognitive priority, not ontological priority. This ordering is central to the post-metaphysical stance.
  - **第〇实在 (di ling shizai)**: "Zeroth Reality" / ultimate ground / thing-in-itself. This is what pre-nihilist metaphysics sought: the ultimate substrate that generates phenomena. The framework's radical claim: 第〇实在 doesn't exist for us—not because it doesn't exist ontologically, but because whenever we attempt to posit it, what we actually create is 第二实在 (an interpretation of 第一实在). The moment we think about "ultimate reality," we've already constructed a concept from phenomenal experience. This is analogous to Kant's noumenon or Laozi's "dao that can be spoken is not the eternal dao."
  - **第一实在 (di yi shizai)**: "First Reality" = phenomenal experience (P). This is epistemologically and cognitively basic. We start here, necessarily and indubitably. Not a metaphysical claim that only consciousness exists (idealism), but a methodological claim that cognition begins with phenomenal given.
  - **第二实在 (di er shizai)**: "Second Reality" = constructed interpretations. This includes the objective world of persisting objects, scientific theories, concepts, selves—all cognitive structures (境) built from 第一实在.
- **Philosophy of Mind Implications**: This ordering inverts much philosophy of mind. Instead of explaining how physical (第〇实在?) generates mental (第一实在), we study how mental (第一实在) gets structured into cognitive models (第二实在), remaining agnostic about ultimate ground (第〇实在). This brackets the hard problem: we don't explain why consciousness exists, but study how it organizes itself.
- **Cognitive Science Implications**: Research program becomes: given phenomenal field P (第一实在), how do cognitive structures (第二实在) emerge, stabilize, evolve? This legitimizes phenomenological methods while maintaining scientific rigor through formal (category-theoretic) tools.
