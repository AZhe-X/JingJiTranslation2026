# Reading Notes — 境集

## Overview

The collection develops a post-metaphysical framework grounded in phenomena (現象) as "first reality" (第一實在). Uses category theory to model the structure of thought/experience. Central concept: 境 (jìng) — the structured experiential domain.

### 1. 关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一

**Core argument**: Collective interests ARE real — not reducible to individual interests, but emergent at different scales (like ocean waves emerging from molecular motion).

**Key concepts**:
- **Renormalization** (重整化): Borrowed from physics. Macro-level phenomena emerge from micro-level interactions but have their own valid descriptions.
- Individuals can only know FROM their individual standpoint — this is what makes empathy possible (we understand others because we start from ourselves)
- Abstract concepts ARE renormalized phenomena — they're real, not merely nominal

**For mind**: Strong emergence claim. Mental states of individuals are one scale; collective phenomena are another. Both real. The epistemological point about perspective-dependence is crucial — phenomenal access is always from a locus.

### 2. A Thought on Knowledge

**Core argument**: Traditional JTB (justified true belief) definition is practically inoperative. We never have direct access to truth, only to phenomena. All justification ultimately bottoms out in unjustified beliefs or circular justification.

**Key moves**:
1. Belief is subjective, intrinsically unrelated to "objective truth"
2. Truth condition is methodologically impossible — we can only check against phenomena
3. Phenomena must be "digested" into beliefs to serve as justification bases
4. Therefore justification based on phenomena IS justification based on belief
5. Either circular justification (babies have knowledge??) or foundational unjustified beliefs
6. In practice: "knowledge" = "what each individual believes to be correct"

**For mind**: 
- The "digestion" process (現象 → belief) is a mental process — the author acknowledges this but doesn't theorize it
- Strong internalism about epistemic access
- The reliability of introspection is assumed rather than questioned
- What grounds the digestion process? This connects to later work on 境

### 3. 西西弗斯、班与猫

**Core argument**: Absurdity arises from seeking meaning externally when meaning is internally generated. When you stop looking outward, absurdity dissolves.

**Three cases**:
1. **Sisyphus**: Finds meaning in revolt itself (internal purpose, though directed outward)
2. **Office worker**: Feels absurd due to alienation — working for external goals, not internal ones
3. **Cat owner**: Never feels absurd — caring for a cat is intrinsically meaningful, no transcendent purpose needed

**Key claim**: 意义和感受即是两面一体 (meaning and feeling are two sides of the same thing)

**For mind**: This is a phenomenological claim about the nature of meaning. Meaning isn't cognitive/propositional but felt/experiential. The absurd is a felt disconnection, not a logical discovery. Strong affinities with existentialism but also with phenomenology of motivation.

### 4. 后形而上学 整理

**Core framework**:

**Three "realities"**:
- **第〇實在**: The supposed ultimate reality that traditional metaphysics seeks (unreachable)
- **第一實在**: Phenomena — what we actually have. NOT generated, but the starting point
- **第二實在**: Our constructions from phenomena (the "objective world" is a model)

**Types of metaphysics (形而上)**:
- **Type 0**: Recognition of constancy (恆常) — same object across time, abstract concepts
- **Type 1**: Prediction from experience
- **Type 2**: Abstraction from experience (concepts like "honesty")
- **Type 3**: Combination of abstractions (frameworks, values)

**The inversion critique**: 
Using 道德仁義禮 as example — in reality, we observe 禮 (ritual behavior), infer 義, then 仁, then 德, then 道. But we UNDERSTAND it as 道 → 德 → 仁 → 義 → 禮. The generative order gets reversed.

**Non-rationality**: The pursuit of 恆常 (constancy) and ultimate reality is NON-RATIONAL. Reason is a tool; its purpose lies outside itself. This pursuit must be *acknowledged* as non-rational.

**Post-metaphysics**: 
- Recognizes all metaphysics as constructed from phenomena
- Centers on PRACTICE (實踐) — the overlap of ideal and phenomenon
- "Self-realization" — seeing ourselves in phenomena

**For mind**: 
- This is explicitly phenomenological in orientation — phenomena are first, constructions second
- The "objective world" is a MODEL we build from experience
- Mental operations (abstraction, unification, prediction) are not explained but assumed
- The question: what IS this constructive capacity? Is it itself phenomenal?

### 5. 形而上学后的目的：诗意

**Core concepts**:

**梦境 (Dreamscape)**: The "environment" that enables meaning/purpose to arise. Examples: games, novels, rituals. Contains experiences as its purpose.

**Key claim**: 意義和感受即是兩面一體 — meaning and feeling are identical. Dreamscapes are the packaging of experience and the environment for purpose.

**Two kinds of dreamscapes**:
- **沉醉的 (Intoxicated)**: Faith, belief — you don't realize you're in a dreamscape. Functions as logical first principles.
- **清醒的 (Lucid)**: 詩意 (Poiesis) — you KNOW you're in a dreamscape but fully invest anyway. Like playing a game while knowing it's a game.

**We cannot abandon ALL dreamscapes** because feeling is already-given with existence. To have an "I" is already to have feeling.

**Post-metaphysical stance**: The POETIC — lucid engagement, knowing meaning is constructed but fully investing anyway.

**For mind**:
- Consciousness/experience is not something TO BE explained but the ground FROM WHICH we explain
- Meaning-experience is phenomenologically primitive
- The distinction between "intoxicated" and "lucid" engagement is a distinction in phenomenal quality
- Connects to discussions of "knowing that one knows" — meta-awareness

### 6. 范畴论与境 整理

**Why category theory**: To describe the STRUCTURE of thought. External (relational) rather than internal (essential). The claim: exploring external structure IS exploring essence, because any attempt to reach "internal essence" must extend outward into relations.

**Core definitions**:

**P (𝔓)**: Phenomenon — everything we experience. "First reality." Use 感受 (feeling) to refer to any part of P.

**E (境/𝔼)**: Structure on P. A CATEGORY where:
- Objects = parts of experience
- Morphisms = associations/links between experiences (also parts of experience!)
- Therefore: TOWER STRUCTURE (塔式結構) — morphisms can be objects

**Tower structure**: 
- T₀: base objects
- T₁: morphisms of T₀ become objects
- T₂: morphisms of T₁ become objects
- etc.

**Metaphysical concepts as universal properties**:
> A metaphysical concept m is an association in 𝓔 that has universal property in some subcategory 𝓔_m

Example: "Pen" (筆) is the terminal object in the subcategory containing pencils, ballpoints, etc. — the feeling you get when you see any of these similar things.

**Theseus's ship**: The "essence" is the EXPERIENCE — the feeling evoked when you think of anything related to the ship. Not ontological but practical.

**Meta-orders are DESCRIPTIVE not CONSTRUCTIVE**: 境 describes 𝔓, doesn't generate it. We can't directly assign meta-orders without choosing a construction.

**For mind**:
- This is a structural theory of mental content
- Both concepts AND associations are experiential (in 𝔓)
- The tower structure means there's no sharp concept/percept divide
- "Introspection" = using the structural position in 境 as a map to evoke specific experiences
- The claim that we can ACCESS this structure through introspection is crucial but under-argued

### 7. 范畴论与境：K1策略

**Evolution and transformation functors**:

**T_t: 𝔼_t → 𝔼_{t+1}** — evolution of experiential states over time

**F functors**: Extract or convert between domains
- F_{E,L}: Language → full 境
- F_{L→K}: Language → Knowledge
- F_{L→M}: Language → Mathematics

**Stable structures S_E**: Structures preserved across evolution. Could be:
- Innate cognitive structures (if from earliest moment)
- A posteriori frameworks (if formed later)
- Potentially identifiable through K1 strategy

**Knowledge genesis**: 
1. Language game produces statement a
2. Map to belief via F_{L→K}
3. Try to integrate into knowledge network
4. Accept/reject based on whether stable structure S_K is preserved
5. If accepted → knowledge "happens"

**Natural transformations η — THE KEY INSIGHT**:

When you UNDERSTAND something, you experience η — the alignment between:
- External structure evolution (linguistic, mathematical, etc.)
- Internal experiential evolution

**The "I get it" experience IS the η experience itself.**

Example: Looking at "1+1" and thinking, then seeing "1+1=2" and confirming. When these align without effort, you've "mastered" a.

**Self-referential structure**: η_a itself is an experience (in 𝔼), hence introspectable.

**Understanding as natural transformation**:
> When you see "The cat jumped on the table," the sentence unfolds structurally while you mentally simulate the action. When these ALIGN → η → "I understand"

**T (fullness/completion)**: A kind of terminal experience. When 境 achieves closure, we feel "complete." Tension (張力) = multiple potential universal properties, none fully satisfying.

**Philosophical experiments**: By constructing structures that evoke specific experiences, we can empirically verify claims about experiential structure.

**For mind — CRITICAL OBSERVATIONS**:

1. **Understanding is phenomenal**: The claim that understanding is constituted by felt alignment (η) is a strong phenomenological thesis. Understanding isn't propositional attitude but experiential quality.

2. **Structure and qualia**: The framework seems to bypass the hard problem by treating structure AS experiential. But is structural position the same as phenomenal character?

3. **Introspective access**: The whole strategy depends on being able to access 境-structure through introspection. Is this reliable?

4. **Natural transformations as feelings**: This is novel — treating category-theoretic structures as experienced relations.

5. **The evolution of 境**: How does this relate to neural/cognitive processes? The framework is purely phenomenological.

## 附录：关于诗意和境的一些零散想法

**Key supplements**:

1. Being limited to phenomena is NOT tragic — limitations enable (like three-color vision enabling displays).

2. Stable structures in science = seeking stable structures in specific subcategories of 境.

3. Coin-flipping as POETIC practice — must genuinely engage the constructed 境.

4. Death is transcendent to self → cannot truly "be toward death" (contra Heidegger?). We can only care about process.

5. Category theory is just ONE tool — we're already constantly constructing 境 with many tools.

6. Two questions addressed:
   - How is philosophy possible?
   - How is meaning possible? (A Kantian question for meaning?)

## Overall Assessment for Philosophy of Mind

### Strengths

1. **Phenomenological grounding**: Clear commitment to phenomena as starting point. No appeal to entities beyond experience.

2. **Structural approach**: Avoids essence-talk by focusing on relational structure. This sidesteps some metaphysical disputes.

3. **The η thesis**: Novel claim that understanding is constituted by felt structural alignment. Connects semantics to phenomenology.

4. **Integration**: Unifies meaning, understanding, knowledge, and metaphysical concepts under one framework.

5. **Practical orientation**: Philosophy not as discovery of truth but as clarification of experiential structure.

### Questions/Tensions

1. **The hard problem**: Framework treats phenomenal character as primitive but doesn't explain WHY there's something it's like. Does structural description exhaust phenomenal reality?

2. **Introspective reliability**: Heavy dependence on introspection accessing 境-structure. What about unconscious processes? Biases?

3. **Neural correlates**: Framework is purely phenomenological. How does it interface with cognitive science?

4. **Other minds**: If 境 is first-personal, how do we access others' 境? The framework seems individualistic.

5. **The tower structure**: Is mental life ACTUALLY organized this way? This seems stipulative.

6. **Non-rational foundations**: The author acknowledges pursuing constancy is non-rational. Does this undercut the framework's claims?

### Key passages to flag for translation

- Definition of 境 as structure on 𝔓
- The η explanation of understanding
- 意義和感受即是兩面一體
- The tower structure and why morphisms are also objects
- Universal properties as metaphysical concepts

## Second Reading: Critical Questions Addressed

### 1. Does structural description exhaust phenomenal character?

**Finding**: The author doesn't claim this. The framework is METHODOLOGICAL, not ontological. Footnote [^25] in 后形而上学: "第一实在只是名称，而不是现象是否是本体论上具有实在地位的论断" — "first reality" is a NAME, not an ontological claim. The framework describes structure; it doesn't claim structure is ALL there is to phenomenal character. The hard problem is sidestepped, not dissolved.

### 2. What grounds introspective reliability?

**Finding**: The author makes a MODEST claim about introspection. In K1策略: "我们可以通过自省来验证该函子的存在" — introspection verifies that certain EXPERIENTIAL STRUCTURES exist, not that they accurately track external reality. The question "can I feel this belief in my knowledge network?" is phenomenologically verifiable even if introspection is unreliable about other things.

Key insight: Introspection doesn't need to be ACCURATE about external facts. It just needs to BE an experience. And experiences are in 境 by definition.

### 3. How does the framework handle other minds?

**Finding**: First essay already addresses this: "正是因为人类个体只能从自身出发，共情才得以成立" — empathy is possible PRECISELY BECAUSE we start from individual experience. We don't need direct access to others' 境.

K1策略 adds: Intersubjectivity emerges through SHARED CONSTRAINTS. The "game" example: we achieve η-alignment with external structures (language, math, social practices). If your internal evolution and mine both achieve η with the same external structure, we understand each other — not through direct access, but through triangulation.

### 4. Is the tower structure descriptive or stipulative?

**Finding**: DESCRIPTIVE. Footnote [^10]: "在我们形成形而上的概念之后，我们脑海中的概念也成为了现象的一部分" — concepts BECOME part of phenomena after formation. The tower structure describes how experience actually layers: concepts become experiences become material for further concepts. This isn't stipulated; it's how mental life actually evolves.

### 5. Non-rational foundations — does this undercut the framework?

**Finding**: NO. The non-rational pursuit of 恒常 (constancy) is ACKNOWLEDGED, not invoked as justification. The author isn't claiming: "We must pursue constancy, therefore the framework is valid." Rather: "We DO pursue constancy (non-rationally), and the framework describes that pursuit." The framework is descriptive of what we already do.

### 6. η-experience and understanding — new appreciation

The definition of "mastery" (掌握) as η being the identity morphism is phenomenologically precise:
> "当 η_a 是单位元时，意味着...不需要经过任何额外思考来完成确认"

This captures something real: the felt difference between "I get it instantly" and "I can work it out." The η framework gives structure to this felt difference.
