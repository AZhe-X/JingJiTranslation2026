### Topic #10 — 道德仁義禮 Inversion
**Date:** 2026-02-12

**Question:** Does the author's analysis foreclose or merely bracket ontological priority claims (e.g., Confucian claims that 仁 is ontologically prior to 禮)?

**Resolution:** Framework BRACKETS rather than forecloses.

**Key Evidence:**
1. Footnote 25: "此处'第一实在'只是名称，而不是现象是否是本体论上具有实在地位的论断" — explicitly disclaims ontological commitment
2. Opening of 范畴论与境 offers THREE interpretations without choosing:
   - Structure IS essence
   - Structure REPRESENTS essence  
   - Both together
3. Author states the framework is "仅仅是描述性的" (merely descriptive)

**Initial Concern (Metaphysics):** Anti-essentialism ("structural position exhausts essence") seemed to foreclose ontological priority claims.

**Resolution Path:** Metaphysics withdrew concern after re-reading the opening, which explicitly presents the three interpretations without choosing between them.

**Consensus:** 9/9 advisors agree the question is resolved. The framework permits Confucian ontological claims about 仁's priority alongside the epistemological analysis of how we acquire the concept through observing 禮.

**Implication for Translation:** Translators can proceed knowing the framework is compatible with various ontological positions; no need for editorial intervention on this point.
