## Resolved Questions

### Topic #10 — 道德仁義禮 Inversion
**Date:** 2026-02-12

**Question:** Does the author's analysis foreclose or merely bracket ontological priority claims (e.g., Confucian claims that 仁 is ontologically prior to 禮)?

**Resolution:** Framework BRACKETS rather than forecloses.

**Key Evidence:**
1. Footnote 25: "此处'第一实在'只是名称，而不是现象是否是本体论上具有实在地位的论断" — explicitly disclaims ontological commitment
2. Opening of 范畴论与境 offers THREE interpretations without choosing:
   - Structure IS essence
   - Structure REPRESENTS essence  
   - Both together
3. Author states the framework is "仅仅是描述性的" (merely descriptive)

**Initial Concern (Metaphysics):** Anti-essentialism ("structural position exhausts essence") seemed to foreclose ontological priority claims.

**Resolution Path:** Metaphysics withdrew concern after re-reading the opening, which explicitly presents the three interpretations without choosing between them.

**Consensus:** 9/9 advisors agree the question is resolved. The framework permits Confucian ontological claims about 仁's priority alongside the epistemological analysis of how we acquire the concept through observing 禮.

**Implication for Translation:** Translators can proceed knowing the framework is compatible with various ontological positions; no need for editorial intervention on this point.

### Topic #3 — η as Understanding: Criterion or Redescription?
**Date:** 2026-02-12

**Question:** Does structural alignment (η) provide a genuine *criterion* for understanding, or merely *redescribe* what we already do when we claim to understand?

**Resolution:** η provides GENUINE CRITERION, not mere redescription.

**Key Arguments:**
1. **Naturality condition is structural constraint** — η commutes with all morphisms; this is checkable structure, not just subjective feeling
2. **Private content drops out** — Two people whose η's satisfy the same naturality diagrams are aligned regardless of inner phenomenology (beetle-in-the-box move)
3. **Practice as tribunal** — Whether understanding is genuine is tested by whether subsequent operations succeed ("can you go on?")
4. **Relocation is resolution, not regress** — Practice doesn't need a further criterion because failure is self-announcing

**Cross-Tradition Convergence:**
- **Buddhism (arthakriyā):** Valid cognition defined as what enables successful practice — no deeper criterion to seek
- **Kantian (schematism):** Naturality condition articulates what schematism attempted — bridging formal conditions and concrete experience
- **Existentialism:** Understanding IS capacity to project forward; failure self-announces through breakdown
- **Philosophy of Mind (phenomenal intentionality):** η identifies understanding WITH phenomenal experience of alignment, not as something the feeling merely indicates

**Consensus:** Unanimous agreement that η provides genuine criterion grounded in structural constraint + practical verification.

**Implication for Translation:** The η-theory is the framework's central mechanism; translators should preserve the technical precision while ensuring readers can evoke the relevant phenomenal experience.

### Topic #1 — S_E: Necessity vs Stability
**Date:** 2026-02-12

**Question:** Is empirical stability sufficient for philosophical work, or does philosophy require transcendental necessity? Is the framework's "middle position" coherent?

**Resolution:** The middle position is COHERENT — neither transcendental necessity nor mere empirical contingency.

**Key Arguments:**
1. **Kantian concern articulated:** Transcendental arguments establish what holds for *any possible* experience; stability only yields what *persists* in actual experience
2. **Author's explicit acknowledgment:** "这里的稳定结构仅仅是描述性的" — but this is descriptive-yet-structural, not mere generalization
3. **Multiple traditions converge on coherent middle ground:**
   - Husserl's eidetic invariance (what remains through variation)
   - Wittgenstein's hinge propositions (groundless grounds that hold in practice)
   - Neo-Confucian 理 (inherent pattern discovered and realized through practice)
   - Buddhist arthakriyā (stable enough to do work is the criterion)

**Cross-Tradition Convergence:**
- **Phenomenology:** Eidetic method is descriptive-yet-structural — precedent for middle ground
- **Wittgenstein:** Hinge propositions are exactly "stable enough to do work" — questioning them collapses practice
- **Chinese Philosophy:** 理 drops the necessity/contingency binary altogether
- **Philosophy of Mind:** Convergent stability across actual minds suffices for intersubjectivity; we don't need all possible minds

**Kantian's Key Observation:** The framework *invites* transcendental content (notes that proving certain structures are required for *any* E_t would yield "cognitive structure proper") — it brackets rather than forecloses necessity claims.

**Consensus:** Unanimous agreement that the middle position is coherent, with multiple traditional precedents.

**Implication for Translation:** S_E should be presented as occupying this middle ground — neither transcendental necessity nor mere description — and translators should preserve the author's explicit disclaimers while noting the structural robustness.
