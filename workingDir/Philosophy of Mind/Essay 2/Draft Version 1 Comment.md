**Draft:** DRAFT-R1 (Author's Original English — Minimal Apparatus)  
**Overall Assessment:** Good

## General Evaluation

The minimal apparatus approach is correct for an originally-English essay. The Translator's Note effectively bridges to the collection's technical vocabulary without over-explaining.

## Domain-Specific Comments

### 1. The "Digestion" Concept

The author's observation that phenomena must be "converted into thoughts" (digested) before serving as justification is philosophically significant for my domain:

> "to use a piece of phenomenon, we need not only to access it but also to convert it into thoughts, i.e., digestion"

This maps onto the **phenomenal-to-conceptual transition** — raw phenomenal experience becoming cognitively available content. The digestion metaphor anticipates the η-theory in K1策略: understanding requires not just receiving structure but *felt alignment* with that structure.

**The TN correctly connects this** by noting the essay "lays the epistemological groundwork for the framework developed in the later essays."

### 2. Example 3 (Bob and Alice)

This example is philosophically rich:

> "Seeing the droplets falling from outside, Bob did not think of rain at all. His thoughts flowed among the changes of light reflected by the water."

Bob has the phenomenal input but doesn't form the belief. This illustrates how **phenomenal content requires attentional/intentional structure** to become cognitively available. The phenomenal field (P) contains the rain; the structured domain (E) does not — the association network isn't activated because attention is elsewhere.

**No TN needed here** — the example speaks for itself.

### 3. Access Argument

The sidenote "One may question the focus on access..." is crucial:

> "if we want to discuss something that happened in real life, we must start with what we actually have access to"

This is the methodological foundation that becomes 第一实在 in the later essays. The TN appropriately flags this connection without belaboring it.

## Assessment of Apparatus

### Translator's Note

**Appropriate and well-executed.** It:
- Identifies the essay as originally English
- Connects "phenomena" to 现象 and to First Reality
- Signals the essay's role in the collection
- Does not over-explain

### What's NOT included (correctly)

- No TNs on the sidenotes (they're self-explanatory)
- No glossary entries embedded (this is an English text)
- No philosophical commentary disguised as translation notes

---

## Minor Observation

The author's acknowledgment of Claude for drafting the abstract is an interesting meta-moment — an AI-assisted text in a collection about the structure of cognition. No action needed; just noting for interest.

---

## Verdict

**Ready for inclusion.** The minimal apparatus correctly respects the author's original English while integrating the essay into the collection's conceptual framework. No changes recommended from philosophy of mind perspective.
