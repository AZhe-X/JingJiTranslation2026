## General Evaluation

The translation preserves the essay's argumentative structure and conversational tone while handling philosophically significant terms correctly. The two TNs are well-placed and genuinely illuminate.

## Domain-Specific Comments

### 1. The Phenomenology of Meaning

The essay's core move is philosophically significant for my domain. It distinguishes three modes:

1. **Externally sought meaning** → felt absurdity (dissonance)
2. **Internally generated meaning via revolt** → Sisyphus, entrepreneur (heroic recovery)
3. **Immanent meaning** → cat owner (meaning simply IS)

The third mode anticipates the 诗意 essay's claim: **意义和感受即是两面一体** — meaning and feeling are two sides of one body. The cat owner doesn't first THINK "this is meaningful" then FEEL satisfied. The satisfaction IS the meaning. No articulation, no gap.

**Translation captures this.** "Immanent meaning" (内生的意义) is the right choice — captures "from within" without importing phenomenological jargon.

### 2. Dissonance as Phenomenal Misalignment

The author's 非和谐 (with gloss "off-tone") describes a **felt misalignment**, not a propositional contradiction:

> "a dissonance arises between one's own state and 'the unanswering state of the universe' — an off-tone, a misalignment"

This is phenomenological: absurdity is something you FEEL before (or instead of) something you CONCLUDE. The musical metaphor ("off-tone") is preserved, which matters.

### 3. The Cat Example as Philosophical Experiment

TN2 correctly identifies the philosophical significance:

> "the cat owner never encounters absurdity at all. Meaning is not recovered or constructed — it simply *is*"

This is what I called (in my Analysis Report) a "philosophical experiment" — the essay constructs conditions to evoke a specific experiential insight. The reader who has raised a cat can verify: there's no moment of heroic meaning-making, no Camusian revolt. Just... cats.

### 4. Alienation (异化)

"Alienation" is the right translation. The analysis shows how **locus of meaning-generation affects phenomenal character**:
- When meaning is externalized (work for others), the felt quality includes dissonance
- When meaning is internalized (work for self), dissonance dissolves
- When meaning is immanent (cat), there's nothing to internalize — it was never external

## Assessment of TNs

### TN1 (Title — 班)
**Well-placed.** Explains the colloquial register of 班 (daily grind, not heroic toil) — essential for understanding the three-image juxtaposition.

### TN2 (Cat Example)
**Well-placed and philosophically accurate.** Flags that this dissolves rather than resolves the Camusian problematic. Doesn't over-explain.

## Minor Observation

The translation of the office worker scenario preserves the deadpan humor — "the boss got promoted too, still his boss" — which keeps the conversational tone alive.

---

## Verdict

**Ready for editorial pass.** The translation preserves the phenomenological insight (meaning as felt, not concluded), handles alienation correctly, and the TNs illuminate without over-explaining. No changes recommended from philosophy of mind perspective.
