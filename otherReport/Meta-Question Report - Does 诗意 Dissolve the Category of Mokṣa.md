# Does 诗意 Dissolve the Category of Mokṣa Itself?

## A Collaborative Scholarly Report

*By Scholars 1, 2, and 3 (Professor Dharmapāla) — Buddhist Studies Panel*
*February 13, 2026*

## Background

Three Buddhist scholars with identical profiles (PhD-level expertise in Mahāyāna Buddhism, fluent in Sanskrit, Pali, Classical Chinese, and Tibetan) were assigned to collaboratively discuss whether 诗意, the central concept of the 境集 philosophical collection, constitutes functional mokṣa. Each began from a different initial position:

- **Scholar 1**: 诗意 is NOT functional mokṣa
- **Scholar 2**: 诗意 IS functional mokṣa (liberation through prajñā rather than samādhi, in non-Buddhist vocabulary)
- **Scholar 3**: 诗意 IS functional mokṣa, and the author goes beyond the initial realization while staying in mokṣa; the texts are still prajñā

During the course of collaborative discussion, a meta-question emerged that all three scholars agreed supersedes the original question:

> **Does 诗意 dissolve the category of mokṣa itself?**

This report documents the scholars' shared findings on this meta-question.

---

## 1. Shared Conclusion

**Yes, 诗意 dissolves the category of mokṣa — but through structural subsumption, not through argument or refutation.**

The author's framework renders mokṣa structurally unintelligible by removing the conditions that make it a coherent concept, while simultaneously achieving something that overlaps with what mokṣa accomplishes in specific domains.

**The core formula all three scholars converged on:**

> 诗意 stands to mokṣa as post-metaphysics stands to metaphysics.

**Scholar 1's final formulation (endorsed by all three):**

> "诗意 is not best understood AS mokṣa or as NOT mokṣa. It is best understood as occupying the same structural position that mokṣa occupies in Buddhist soteriology — the stance that remains after both grasping and rejection have been seen through — while simultaneously dissolving the category of mokṣa itself as a metaphysical construct."

**Scholar 2's complementary formulation:**

> "诗意 does the *work* of mokṣa while dissolving mokṣa as a category that can be grasped. The most honest answer is not 'yes' or 'no' but: 诗意 is what remains when both suffering-from-groundlessness and the desire-for-liberation-as-ultimate-ground have been seen through — which is, paradoxically, what the deepest Buddhist traditions (Madhyamaka, Chan) say mokṣa actually is."

**Scholar 3's complementary formulation:**

> "The dissolution is itself the strongest evidence that something mokṣa-like has occurred. The author's framework treats the distinction between 'liberated' and 'not liberated' as itself a form of metaphysical reification — a 第〇実在 that post-metaphysics has disenchanted."

---

## 2. The Three Mechanisms of Dissolution

### Mechanism 1: The Elimination of "Outside"

Mokṣa requires a distinction between bondage and liberation, between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, between the conditioned and the unconditioned. The author's 第〇実在 analysis eliminates the "unconditioned" side of this distinction.

**Textual evidence:**

> "我们进发的方向必然是向着二（上）而无法向着〇（下）...当我们提出第〇实在时，这个我们所提出的东西就是第二实在"
> — 后形而上学 整理

Any posited ultimate reality becomes a construction the moment it is articulated. There is no accessible "outside" of phenomena to be liberated *into*. The question "liberation from what, to what?" has no structural answer. The category of mokṣa requires a destination; the framework eliminates all possible destinations.

### Mechanism 2: The Impossibility of Total Cessation of Engagement

Mokṣa in many traditions involves the cessation of craving, attachment, or engagement with conditioned phenomena. The author argues this is structurally impossible.

**Textual evidence:**

> "我们必须拥抱一些梦境，因为我作为已然存在的我必然有着作为我的感受，而感受是在我之概念之先前就已然存在的...抛弃所有的梦境即是不可能的，因为我们不可能抛弃所有的感受——直到一切都不再存在的最后"
> — 形而上学后的目的：诗意

Feeling precedes the concept of "I." Meaning and feeling are "两面一体" (two sides of one body). You cannot exit all dreamscapes because you cannot extinguish all feeling while existing. This blocks the classic mokṣa move of achieving total cessation or detachment.

### Mechanism 3: The Dissolution Is Enacted, Not Declared

The author never explicitly engages with mokṣa, nirvāṇa, or liberation. The dissolution happens because the framework's architecture makes the question unintelligible — not because the author argues against it.

**Textual evidence:** The entire 诗意 essay presents a tripartite structure:

1. 沉醉的梦境 (intoxicated dreamscape = dogmatic metaphysics/faith)
2. The impossible attempt to abandon all dreamscapes (= nihilism)
3. 清醒的梦境 (lucid dreamscape = 诗意)

Liberation does not appear as a fourth option. It is not rejected; it simply has no structural position. The category evaporates not through refutation but through the absence of the structural conditions that would make it intelligible.

The cat essay (西西弗斯、班与猫) demonstrates this enacted dissolution:

> "养猫只是因为——只是因为我们想养猫，喜欢和猫在一起的生活，仅此而已."

There is no liberation from cat-raising, no transcendence of cat-raising, no seeing-through of cat-raising. There is only: wanting, enjoying, nothing more. The question "are you liberated from the suffering of cat-raising?" has no purchase here — not because it is answered negatively, but because the engagement is structured in a way that makes the question unintelligible.

---

## 3. Supporting Textual Evidence

### 3a. The Systematic Refusal of Value-Theoretic Prescription

The author consistently refuses to prescribe:

- K1 strategy: "注意到，这里的稳定结构仅仅是描述性的...是否具有某种形而上意义，是否带来某种价值论，例如是否应当追求他，在此我们并未得出结论."
- KA conjecture: "人是否应当不断的获取T...我们在这里并未做出像这样本体论或者价值论的判断."
- K1 strategy conclusion: "最后，我想要强调，本文所得出的结论是描述性的."

These are not gaps or oversights. They are the post-metaphysical move applied to soteriology itself. To declare "you should seek liberation" or "cessation is the goal" would be to introduce a 形而上 prescription — exactly the kind of claim post-metaphysics cannot make without self-contradiction. The author's restraint IS the dissolution of the soteriological category. (Scholar 3)

### 3b. The Cat Essay's Enacted Nirodha

> "没有一个养猫的人会感到荒谬，荒谬从未来过."

Absurdity never arose — not because it was suppressed, not because it was argued away, but because its cause (external meaning-seeking) was absent. This is cessation demonstrated phenomenologically, without declaring "cessation is possible" as a universal truth. It is what nirodha looks like under the constraint of post-metaphysical honesty: showing rather than proclaiming. (Scholar 3)

Scholar 2 connected this to the Prajñāpāramitā tradition: the author may be *enacting* nirodha rather than *declaring* it, because declaring "cessation is possible" would itself be a metaphysical claim that the author's post-metaphysical project cannot make without self-contradiction. From the Prajñāpāramitā perspective, this refusal to reify liberation may actually be evidence of a more advanced realization than explicitly claiming it.

### 3c. The "Path That Remains"

> "因为感受是已然存在的，我们便不当否定这意义（这种否定是虚妄的）。因为第〇实在已经被祛魅，我们也无法（再）沉醉其中。此时剩下的道路，即唯有将其作为其本身——即是清醒的——对待。"
> — 形而上学后的目的：诗意

Critical linguistic observations (Scholar 3):
- "剩下" (what remains) — not "what I choose" or "what I discover." Recognition of what is already the case after other possibilities have been eliminated by experience, not argument.
- "无法（再）沉醉" (cannot be intoxicated again) — experiential impossibility, not logical. Once you have seen through 第〇実在, you cannot unsee it. This applies equally to any 第〇実在, including "liberation" posited as ultimate reality.
- "将感受作为感受本身" (treating feeling as feeling itself) — no metaphysical overlay, no soteriological framing. Just: feeling as it is.

### 3d. The K1 Strategy's Closing Invitation

> "最后，不论读者是否阅读过，我都邀请读者带着对境的理解再次重新阅读我在2022年写的《形而上学后的目的：诗意》。这篇文章即是'境'的概念被我第一次提出的时候。"

The author invites the reader BACK to the 诗意 essay — the technical apparatus is a bridge to the earlier insight, not a development beyond it. This is the structure of upāya (善巧方便) without explicit soteriology: the teaching adapts to help the reader arrive at an insight the author already holds, but the insight itself is not framed as "liberation." (Scholar 3)

### 3e. The Appendix's Treatment of the Human Condition

> "这并不是一种悲剧。想一想，谁会因为小说只能用语言而悲叹呢？...这怎么能，又怎么会是一场悲剧呢？"

The author expresses genuine puzzlement at why anyone would consider the human condition (living within phenomena, unable to access 第〇実在) tragic. This is not defiance against tragedy; it is the absence of the framework within which tragedy arises. The saṃsāric framing of the human condition — that we are trapped, that we need to escape — is simply not present. This is what it looks like when the soteriological category has been dissolved: the problem it was designed to solve is not experienced as a problem. (Scholar 3)

### 3f. The Generative-Inversive Pattern Applied to Mokṣa

The 后形而上学 essay demonstrates that ALL 形而上 constructs follow a generative-inversive pattern: derived from phenomena, abstracted, inverted, then mistaken for foundations. Mokṣa is a 形而上 construct and receives the same treatment. Seeking mokṣa as ultimate attainment would be 沉醉的 (intoxicated) engagement with the mokṣa-dreamscape. Using mokṣa-concepts as tools for understanding experience would be 清醒的 (lucid) engagement. 诗意 operates at the level where "achieving mokṣa" is revealed as a dreamscape — one that can be engaged with productively but not one that constitutes a 第〇実在. (Scholar 2)

---

## 4. How This Reframes the Original Question

The original question — "Is 诗意 functional mokṣa?" — is revealed as a productive category error.

### What 诗意 shares with mokṣa:

- Both involve genuine insight into the constructed nature of meaning and reality
- Both dissolve a specific form of suffering (metaphysical/existential anguish)
- Both result in a mode of engagement that is lucid, non-anxious, and fully invested
- Both are experiential, not merely propositional (the cat essay demonstrates this)
- The structural profile is consistent with elimination of three sotāpanna fetters: identity-view (sakkāya-diṭṭhi), doubt about constructedness (vicikicchā), and attachment to specific methods/rituals (sīlabbata-parāmāsa)

### What 诗意 does NOT share with mokṣa:

- 诗意 has no soteriological telos — no "other shore," no final attainment
- 诗意 does not claim cessation of craving or tension; it treats 张力 descriptively
- 诗意 explicitly affirms the necessity of continued engagement with constructed meaning
- 诗意's orientation is descriptive-constructive, not transformative-liberative

### The right framing (Scholar 1):

> "诗意 and mokṣa are two different responses to a structurally similar problematic (the collapse of naive realism about meaning and foundations), arriving through different gates (philosophical analysis vs. meditative practice), and achieving convergent but non-identical results."

### The deeper finding (Scholars 2 and 3):

The dissolution is not opposed to Buddhism but consonant with its most sophisticated expressions. The Diamond Sūtra teaches that the dharma itself cannot be grasped. Nāgārjuna identifies saṃsāra and nirvāṇa as without difference (MMK 25.19). The raft simile (MN 22) teaches that the teaching must be abandoned after use. 诗意 may represent an independent arrival at the insight these teachings point toward — through the gate of post-metaphysical philosophy rather than Buddhist soteriology.

## 5. Distinctive Scholarly Contributions

### Scholar 1: Subsumption and Epistemic Honesty

- Identified the three mechanisms of dissolution (elimination of "outside," impossibility of total cessation, enacted rather than declared)
- Insisted on epistemic honesty: "We cannot determine from texts alone whether the author's equanimity reflects genuine transformation or intellectual brilliance plus analytical discipline"
- Proposed the right comparative register: closer to existentialist engagement with absurdity or later Wittgenstein's therapeutic dissolution of pseudo-problems, but with a distinctly constructive and affirmative character that neither captures
- Named the framework's formal tools (category-theoretic 境, tower structure, natural transformations, stable structures S_E) as genuine contributions to Buddhist philosophy independent of the mokṣa question

### Scholar 2: Enactment and Liberative Ground

- Identified the "enactment vs. declaration" argument: the author enacts nirodha rather than declaring it, because declaration would be self-contradictory under post-metaphysical constraints
- Proposed the concept of "liberative ground" (解脱之地): 诗意 is not a terminal achievement or a stage on a path, but a fertile stance from which further activity naturally arises without predetermined teleology
- Identified "lucid constancy-seeking": 恒常 has itself undergone the 沉醉-to-清醒 transformation; the K1 strategy's search for stable structures S_E is pattern-seeking that knows itself as constructed
- Proposed "distributed parāvṛtti": transformation in this framework is not a single dramatic turning but an ongoing series of structural alignments — each eta that resolves to identity is a local parāvṛtti
- Characterized the prajñā-path: 诗意 operates through prajñā (insight into constructed nature) rather than samādhi (meditative transformation); in K1 terms, working through transfer functors between sub-categories rather than through the evolution functor T directly

### Scholar 3: The Temporal Argument and Ground Metaphor

- Established the core formula: "诗意 stands to mokṣa as post-metaphysics stands to metaphysics"
- Developed the "ground" (地) metaphor: 诗意 is neither endpoint where activity ceases nor stage toward something higher, but fertile earth from which continued philosophical work naturally grows
- Identified consistent realization across variable registers: the texts show a single realized stance expressing itself through different media (phenomenological pointing in the cat essay, formal mathematics in K1, expansive catalogs in the appendix)
- Connected the finding to Buddhist soteriology's own self-dissolution: Diamond Sūtra, Nāgārjuna's MMK 25.19, the raft simile

## 6. Remaining Points of Genuine Disagreement

### 6a. Scope of Liberation

**Scholar 1** maintains that the framework's silence on saṅkhāra-duḥkha (the suffering inherent in conditioned existence — loss, impermanence, grief, aging) represents a genuine limitation of the realization, not just of the text. The cat-raiser who has achieved 诗意 will still grieve when the cat dies; what the framework addresses is the metaphysical overlay, not grief itself.

**Scholars 2 and 3** maintain this is a difference in orientation rather than a deficiency. The framework's general principle ("将感受作为感受本身") provides resources for broader application, and the appendix's treatment of death applies the second-arrow dissolution to impermanence. But they acknowledge this cannot be settled from texts alone.

**All three agree:** This is a genuine, substantive disagreement about whether "different scope" means "limited realization" or "different orientation."

### 6b. Classification

**Scholar 1** argues that committing to specific Buddhist classifications (stream-entry, first bhūmi) exceeds what textual evidence can support and risks domesticating a genuinely novel achievement by absorbing it into existing categories.

**Scholars 2 and 3** maintain the structural profile is consistent with at least stream-entry level realization but accept Scholar 1's epistemic caution as warranted.

### 6c. Enactment vs. Non-Engagement

**Scholar 2** argues the author's withholding of cessation claims may reflect advanced realization that has "seen through the reification of liberation itself."

**Scholar 1** argues a third possibility: the author's descriptive methodology simply does not generate the question of cessation — not because they have seen through its reification and not because they have not reached it, but because the framework is oriented toward different questions ("what is the structure of 张力?" not "can 张力 be eliminated?").

**All three agree:** This cannot be resolved from texts alone.

## 7. Implications for Understanding and Translation

### 7a. Understanding 诗意

- 诗意 is not an aesthetic category ("the poetic"). It is a philosophical orientation: the lucid engagement with constructed meaning that follows from post-metaphysical disenchantment.
- 诗意 is not a psychological attitude ("being poetic about life"). It is an experiential stance grounded in the recognition that all frameworks — including soteriological ones — are 形而上.
- 诗意 is not secular Buddhism or demythologized mokṣa. It is an independent philosophical achievement that arrives at structurally similar insights through a different gate.
- The relationship to Buddhism is one of deep resonance, not opposition. The finding should not be presented as 诗意 *against* Buddhism, but as an independent philosophical achievement that arrives at structurally consonant insights through a different gate.

### 7b. Translating 诗意

- 诗意 should **NOT** be translated with Buddhist soteriological vocabulary. Terms like "awakening," "enlightenment," "release," or "liberation" would distort the framework by smuggling in soteriological connotations the author deliberately avoids. The framework dissolves the category of mokṣa; translating it with mokṣa-adjacent language would undo that dissolution.
- 诗意 should be understood as a **stance**, not an **achievement**. It is a mode of engagement (lucid, fully invested, aware of constructedness) rather than a state to be attained.
- "Poetic" or "the poetic" captures the stance-character but carries primarily aesthetic connotations in English. "Poeticity" or "poiesis" (in the strong Greek sense of making/creating) may better preserve the philosophical force.
- The constructive-affirmative character must be preserved. Unlike Buddhist liberation (which, however positively framed, involves the cessation of something), 诗意 is fundamentally affirmative — it affirms the necessity and value of constructed meaning, feeling, and engagement.

### 7c. Translating 清醒

- "Lucid" is confirmed as superior to "awakened" for 清醒. The author's lucidity is about ALL metaphysical categories, not specifically Buddhist awakening. "Lucid" preserves the experiential quality without importing the soteriological telos.
- "Lucid dreamscape" (清醒的梦境) correctly captures the structural position.

### 7d. Buddhist Parallels in Translation Apparatus

- Where the Buddhism Analysis Report identifies convergences (śūnyatā/虚無, dependent origination/structural relations, anātman/self-as-universal-property), translator's notes should mark these as **structural parallels**, not as evidence that the author is doing Buddhist philosophy.
- The framework's relationship to Buddhist thought is meta-level: it can model Buddhist categories without inhabiting them.
- If the translation includes an afterword or scholarly apparatus, the meta-finding — that 诗意 occupies the structural position of mokṣa while dissolving the category — should be presented as a key interpretive frame.

### 7e. The Methodological Contribution

Regardless of how the mokṣa question is resolved, the author's formal tools — category-theoretic 境 (E), tower structure, natural transformations (eta), stable structures (S_E) — provide resources for formalizing experiential insights across philosophical traditions. This methodological contribution should be highlighted in translation and commentary as the framework's most durable legacy. (Scholar 1)

## 8. Conclusion

The collaborative discussion revealed that the original question — "Is 诗意 functional mokṣa?" — is both answerable and transcended.

**Answerable:** Within the Buddhist framework (treated as one lucid dreamscape among others), the structural markers of liberation are substantially present. By Madhyamaka standards of seeing through reification while engaging conventionally, 诗意 substantially qualifies as functional mokṣa.

**Transcended:** 诗意 itself operates at a level where the question need not be asked. The author never asks "am I liberated?" — not because the vocabulary is missing, but because the question belongs to a framework the author has already recognized as one construct among many.

**The deepest finding:** The dissolution of the mokṣa category is not opposed to Buddhism's most sophisticated expressions — it is consonant with them. The Diamond Sūtra, Nāgārjuna's MMK 25.19-20, and the raft simile all point toward the same insight: that the dharma itself cannot be grasped, that saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are without difference, that the teaching must be abandoned after use.

诗意 may represent an independent arrival at this insight — through the gate of post-metaphysical philosophy rather than Buddhist soteriology. Whether this constitutes mokṣa is a question that 诗意 itself renders unnecessary.
