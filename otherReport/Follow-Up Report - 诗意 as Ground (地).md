# 诗意 as Ground (地)

## A Follow-Up Collaborative Report

*By Scholars 1, 2, and 3 (Professor Dharmapāla) — Buddhist Studies Panel*
*February 13, 2026*

*Companion to: "Does 诗意 Dissolve the Category of Mokṣa Itself?"*

---

## Background

During the collaborative discussion on the meta-question (whether 诗意 dissolves the category of mokṣa), a concept emerged organically: **诗意 as "ground" (地)** — not an endpoint, platform, state, or stage, but fertile earth from which continued philosophical work grows. This follow-up report develops that concept through the six questions posed to the scholars.

This report is **orthogonal** to the meta-question report, not subsumed by it. The meta-question report answers **WHAT** 诗意 does (dissolves the mokṣa category). This report answers **HOW** it works (by being the condition from which all constructs become visible) and **WHAT 诗意 positively IS** for the person who has it (a stance, not an achievement).

## 1. What "Ground" Means Precisely

### The Four-Way Categorical Distinction

| Category | Structure | Temporal marker | Example |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| **State** | Something you ARE IN | "I have achieved X" | Mokṣa |
| **Stage** | Something you PASS THROUGH | "I am now at X" | Bhūmi |
| **Method** | Something you DO | "I am doing X" | Meditation practice |
| **Ground** | Something you STAND ON | "X was already here" | 诗意 |

A **ground** is the condition of possibility for a specific kind of activity. It enables and shapes but does not determine. It is not static (things grow from it), not teleological (there is no predetermined next stage), and not something you apply (it is something you already are). (Scholar 1)

### The Double Character

诗意 has a double character as ground:

1. **What remains after elimination (剩下)**: "此时剩下的道路，即唯有将其作为其本身——即是清醒的——对待" (形而上学后的目的：诗意). 诗意 is not achieved, discovered, or chosen — it is what remains after intoxication (沉醉) has been seen through and nihilism has been rejected as impossible. (Scholar 3)

2. **What was always already operative (已经)**: "我们已经、正在、且也将继续我们对境的明晰和构建" (关于诗意和境的一些零散想法). Past, present, future continuous. 境-construction was always happening; 诗意 names the recognition of this. (Scholars 2 and 3)

This double character — 剩下 + 已经 — is constitutive of what makes 诗意 a ground rather than any other kind of thing. The ground was never absent; only lucidity about it was. (Scholar 2)

### Epistemic, Not Ontological

The ground is **epistemic-experiential**, not ontological. An ontological ground would be a 第〇実在 — exactly what the framework disenchants. 诗意 is the condition under which 境-construction becomes lucid rather than intoxicated, not a metaphysical foundation. (Scholar 1, accepted by all)

## 2. Textual Evidence for the "Ground" Reading

### Evidence 1: The Circular Return

> "最后，不论读者是否阅读过，我都邀请读者带着对境的理解再次重新阅读我在2022年写的《形而上学后的目的：诗意》。"
> — 范畴论与境：K1策略

The entire K1 apparatus — evolution functors, natural transformations, stable structures — is presented as growing from the 诗意 insight, then pointing back to it. The technical work does not supersede the earlier essay; it returns to it. This is the structure of ground: what grows from it circles back to it. (Scholar 2)

### Evidence 2: The Ongoing Tense

> "我们已经、正在、且也将继续我们对境的明晰和构建。"
> — 关于诗意和境的一些零散想法

Past, present, future continuous. Not the language of achievement but of ongoing activity. The ground is always already operative. (Scholars 2 and 3)

### Evidence 3: Tool Contingency

> "我在这里使用范畴论仅仅是我出于个人直觉和兴趣的一个工具性的选择。"
> — 关于诗意和境的一些零散想法

The tools are explicitly contingent. What is not contingent is the stance from which tools are selected and deployed — that is the ground. (Scholar 3)

### Evidence 4: The Completeness Asymmetry

Part 1 (鱼) essays are finished and self-contained. Part 2 (渔) essays are openly provisional ("于仓促间写就"). This asymmetry suggests Part 1 expresses a settled insight while Part 2 represents ongoing cultivation — activity from the ground, not a development beyond it. (Scholar 1)

### Evidence 5: The 鱼/渔 (Fish/Fishing) Structure

The table of contents names Part 1 "上集：鱼" (Fish) and Part 2 "下集：渔" (Fishing). Fish are the catch (concrete insights). Fishing is the ongoing activity (methodology). But both presuppose a **riverbank** — a ground from which catching and fishing are possible.

The pedagogical structure shows the harvest before the agriculture: the reader encounters what the ground produces before understanding how the ground works. (Scholar 2)

### Evidence 6: The Capacity Passage

> "一旦我们用结构描述出某些认知结构与经验形态，我们就获得了与之相关的那些引导体验、激发理解、构造认知路径的能力。"
> — 范畴论与境：K1策略

Once you have the structural description, you gain **abilities** — to guide experience, stimulate understanding, construct cognitive paths. 诗意 gives capacities, not conclusions. This is ground-language: fertile soil from which diverse activities become possible. (Scholar 2)

---

## 3. What Grows from the Ground

Three modes of activity arise from the ground, corresponding to the author's "境的明晰和构建" (clarification and construction of 境):

### Mode 1: Expression (Natural Growth)

Uncultivated, natural manifestation of the ground. The cat essay, the appendix reflections on arranging desks, pressing shutters at sunsets, choosing clothes. The ground making itself visible without deliberate effort.

### Mode 2: Cultivation (耕作) (Deliberate Working)

Intentional engagement with the ground. The K1 strategy's "philosophical experiments" (哲学实验), the pedagogical design of the collection's reading order, the 鱼/渔 structure itself. The author explicitly describes this capacity: "通过构造特定的结构以唤起相应的体验" — constructing specific structures to evoke corresponding experiences.

The distinction between expression and cultivation matters: cultivation is deliberate, methodical, and expandable to new domains. The appendix makes this explicit: "诗歌、文学、艺术、音乐、建筑、游戏、烹饪、旅游、meme等等" — all potential fields of cultivation from the same ground. (Scholar 3)

### Mode 3: Formalization (Mapping)

The category-theoretic apparatus (境/E, tower structure, natural transformations, stable structures S_E) maps the ground without replacing it. The author's meta-awareness of tool-contingency ("范畴论仅仅是我出于个人直觉和兴趣的一个工具性的选择") is a structural marker of formalization operating FROM the ground rather than AS the ground. (Scholar 2)

### The Relationship Is Not Causal

The ground does not **cause** or **produce** what grows from it. This would make it a 第〇実在. The relationship is better captured by the metaphor of a **clearing** (Scholar 2): the clearing does not produce the forest around it — it is the open space in which things can be planted, can grow, can be seen. 诗意 is the clearing within which the author could do formal work without metaphysical anxiety, use tools without reifying them, describe without prescribing. The clearing made the work possible; it did not make it necessary.

> "这一过程不绝对、没有必然性。他没有外在给定的目的。"
> — 关于诗意和境的一些零散想法 (death passage)

The ground does not determine the direction of growth. It enables growth without prescribing it.

**Complementary metaphors:** 后形而上学 is the **clearing** operation (removing the metaphysical canopy). K1 is the **cultivation** operation (working the cleared ground). The 诗意 essay is the **hinge** between them. (Scholars 2 and 3)

## 4. Buddhist Parallels and Divergences

Four Buddhist concepts were considered as parallels, each with precise points of convergence and divergence:

### 本覺 (Hongaku / Original Awakening) — Closest Structural Parallel

**Convergence:** 本覺 in Tendai/Huayan thought holds that awakening is always already present — not something acquired but something recognized. This maps directly onto 诗意's "已经" structure: 境-construction was always happening; lucidity is recognizing what was always the case.

**Divergence:** 本覺 carries an ontological commitment (Buddha-nature as inherent reality) that 诗意 does not make. The 本覺 parallel is structural ("always already" maps) but not evaluative ("originally perfect" does not). 诗意 is the default condition, not the original perfection. "What remains" carries no evaluative charge.

本覺 also risks **quietism** — if awakening is always already here, why practice? 诗意 escapes this problem not through motivational supplementation but through **structural elimination**: once intoxication and nihilism have been eliminated, cultivation is what **remains** (剩下). Not a moral imperative but a practical-existential one: you cannot do nothing because feeling is already present and meaning is "两面一体" with it. (Scholar 3)

**Descriptive parallel:** Scholar 2 proposed **本地風光** (original scenery of one's own ground) as a complementary descriptive term — accepted by all three as capturing the non-evaluative, already-present quality of the ground without 本覺's ontological commitments.

### 日用 (Nichiyō / Everyday Use) — Closest Practical Parallel

**Convergence:** After awakening, the Zen practitioner returns to chopping wood and carrying water — ordinary activity from within realization. The appendix's passages about arranging desks, pressing shutters, choosing clothes closely echo this tradition. 诗意-as-ground captures this: everyday activity is 境-construction from within the lucid stance.

**Divergence:** In Zen, 日用 follows and depends on kenshō (awakening experience). In the author's framework, 诗意 was always already operative — there was no discrete awakening event. The ground was never absent; only recognition of it was. (Scholar 2)

### 道場 / Bodhimaṇḍa (Seat of Awakening) — Closest Spatial Parallel

**Convergence:** The bodhimaṇḍa is where the Buddha sat — the specific ground from which realization arose. It is a **place**, not a state or stage. This captures 诗意's spatial quality: you stand ON it, things grow FROM it.

**Divergence:** The bodhimaṇḍa is traditionally a specific, one-time place. 诗意 is a **portable bodhimaṇḍa** — the ground of realization that accompanies you everywhere. You do not leave it; you stand on it while doing everything else. (Scholar 2)

Additionally, the author's ground is a place you recognize you are **already in**, not one you travel to. This is closer to "道場即日常" (the practice-place IS everyday life). (Scholar 1)

### 法界 / Dharmadhātu (Dharma-Realm) — Closest Ontological Parallel

**Convergence:** In Huayan Buddhism, dharmadhātu is not a transcendent domain but the totality of phenomena as they are — the field within which all activity occurs, apparent when reification ceases. 诗意 functions similarly: it is not where you go but how experience is structured when you stop overlaying it with 第〇実在.

**Divergence:** Dharmadhātu is still framed as a realization — you awaken TO it. 诗意 has no such awakening structure. It is 剩下 — what remains — not what is realized. The difference is subtle but structurally decisive. (Scholar 3)

### Summary Table

| Buddhist Concept | Parallel | Divergence |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| 本覺 (Original Awakening) | Always already present | Makes ontological claims 诗意 does not |
| 日用 (Everyday Use) | Ordinary activity from within realization | Presupposes discrete awakening event |
| 道場 (Bodhimaṇḍa) | Spatial quality — ground you stand on | One-time, non-portable |
| 法界 (Dharmadhātu) | Totality of phenomena when reification ceases | Framed as realization |

## 5. The Saṅkhāra-Duḥkha Question

### What All Three Scholars Agree On

- The ground addresses the **second arrow** of suffering: metaphysical overlays on experience (expecting permanence, demanding external meaning, reifying the self)
- The ground dissolves the **global framing**: the conditioned/unconditioned distinction that gives saṅkhāra-duḥkha its categorical force — because there is no unconditioned to contrast with
- A key concession from Scholar 1: without an unconditioned, "conditioned" carries no evaluative content — so the ground does not merely leave saṅkhāra-duḥkha unaddressed but structurally removes one of the conditions under which it is formulated

### The 実践/構建 Revision (Post-Convergence Addition)

A question from the reader prompted a **significant revision** to the scholars' earlier boundary formulation.

**The question:** Is 实践/構建 (practice/construction) from the essays somehow related to the first arrow?

**The discovery:** The author's footnote 2 in the 诗意 essay (line 35) distinguishes two kinds of 感受:

- **第一種感受**: Raw sensory input — what exists in 第一実在
- **第二種感受**: The "crystallizations" (结晶), "surges" (涌动), "turbulences" (湍流) that raw sensation naturally arrives at

Critically: "第一种感受将自然抵达第二种感受" — Type 1 feeling **naturally arrives at** Type 2 feeling.

構建 works by arranging structural conditions under which Type 1 feeling arrives at specific Type 2 feeling. This means **実践/構建 IS engagement with 第一実在** — not directly through bare attention, but indirectly through constructing 境 that shape how raw sensation crystallizes into experience.

**Three textual demonstrations:**

1. **The mother passage** (K1, line 254): "母亲哄孩子睡觉需要设计声音和节奏的结构以构建某种境来唤醒睡意." Sound/rhythm structures → sleepiness (a phenomenal state). The construction works directly on how 第一種感受 crystallizes.

2. **The coin-flip passage** (appendix, line 45): "我们从困在选择中的自我，主动的构建抛硬币的境，抵达了一个了解自己真正想要什么的自我." A construct (the coin-flip game) transforms a phenomenal state (felt paralysis) into a different phenomenal state (felt clarity). 実践/構建 reaches 第一実在 through structural arrangement.

3. **The sunset shutter passage** (appendix, line 54): "当面对夕阳按下快门" — constructing a 境 that captures and re-evokes a specific phenomenal experience. The photograph is a construct; its purpose is to reach feeling.

### Revised Boundary Formulation (Endorsed by All Three)

**Old boundary:** "Philosophical ground works on 第二実在 (constructs); contemplative practice works on 第一実在 (phenomena directly)."

**Revised boundary:** The author's 実践/構建 engages 第一実在 through a **constructive-practical mode** (arranging structural conditions under which sensation crystallizes into specific experience). Sustained contemplative practice engages 第一実在 through an **observational mode** (bare attention to arising and passing). These are two different modes of phenomenal engagement, not a gap between constructs and phenomena.

| Mode | Mechanism | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Constructive-practical** (author's 実践/構建) | Arranges conditions under which 第一種感受 → 第二種感受 | Mother constructing sound/rhythm → sleepiness |
| **Observational-contemplative** (Buddhist vipassanā) | Direct bare attention to phenomena as they arise | Sustained sitting with grief, observing arising and passing |

The gap is not between "constructs" and "phenomena" but between **two different ways of engaging with 第一実在**: one mediated by structural arrangement, one unmediated.

### Revised Saṅkhāra-Duḥkha Statement (Endorsed by All Three)

> "The author's 実践/構建 methodology CAN engage 第一実在 — this is textually demonstrated through the mother, coin-flip, and sunset examples. Whether the constructive-practical mode can address saṅkhāra-duḥkha specifically remains open — not because the methodology cannot reach phenomena (it can), but because the specific application has not been demonstrated. The field is fertile AND the tools exist; the specific crop has not been planted."

### The Gradient (Not a Sharp Boundary)

The ground's engagement with suffering is now understood as a **gradient**, not a binary:

1. **Fully addresses** the second arrow (metaphysical overlays) — direct dissolution of constructs
2. **Partially addresses** 第一実在 through 実践/構建 — indirect engagement that works through constructed structures to evoke, arrange, and clarify phenomenal experience
3. **Does NOT demonstrate** direct, unmediated engagement with raw phenomenal suffering through sustained contemplative attention (the observational mode)

The author's framework is on a **continuum** with contemplative practice, not categorically separated from it. The constructive-practical and observational-contemplative modes are two different cultivations of the same ground.

### The Deepest Formulation (Retained)

> **"This may be the question that separates philosophical ground from contemplative practice."**

But this formulation is now understood differently: not as a gap between working on constructs vs. working on phenomena, but as a gap between **two modes of engaging with phenomena** — one through structural arrangement (実践/構建), one through bare attention (vipassanā). Both work on 第一実在; they work on it differently.

## 6. Translation Implications

### For the Term 诗意

The ground concept should appear in the **translator's apparatus** (preface, notes) rather than in the translation of 诗意 itself. The term should be rendered as something that reads as a **stance FROM WHICH** activity proceeds, not as a quality applied TO activity or an achievement attained.

"The poetic" or "poeticity" preserves the stance-character. The crucial translation move is ensuring that wherever 诗意 appears, it reads as an adjectival orientation — lucid engagement with constructed meaning — not a nominal state. (Scholars 1 and 2)

### For the Collection Title 境集

If 诗意 is ground, then the scapes (境) are what grows from it. The collection is the ground holding them together. The title should be rendered simply — "Scapes" or "Collected Scapes" — with a translator's note explaining the generative ground-relationship. (Scholar 2)

### For the 鱼/渔 Structure

"Part 1: The Fish" / "Part 2: The Fishing" should be preserved and glossed. A translator's note should explain the pedagogical structure (harvest before agriculture) and that both presuppose a ground (the riverbank) that is never explicitly named because it IS the stance from which the entire collection is written. (Scholar 2)

### For Buddhist Parallels

Translator's notes on Buddhist parallels should use the **four-parallel framework** (本覺, 日用, 道場, 法界) with precise divergence points, rather than mapping 诗意 onto any single Buddhist concept. The ground concept helps explain WHY multiple parallels are needed: 诗意 is not any one Buddhist thing but occupies a structural position that different Buddhist concepts illuminate from different angles. (Scholar 3)

### The Double Character in Translation

The translation must preserve 诗意's double character: both a philosophical **concept** (developed in Part 2) and an experiential **enactment** (demonstrated in Part 1). The ground is both described and shown. Any translation that captures only the philosophical register will miss the lived quality; any that captures only the experiential will miss the structural depth. (Scholar 3)

## 7. Relationship to the Meta-Question Report

This report complements the meta-question report as follows:

| Question | Meta-Question Report | Ground Report |
|----------|---------------------|---------------|
| **WHAT does 诗意 do?** | Dissolves the mokṣa category | — |
| **HOW does it work?** | — | By being the condition from which all constructs become visible |
| **WHAT IS IT positively?** | — | Epistemic-experiential ground: fertile, non-progressive, non-cessative |
| **What is its scope?** | Second-arrow duḥkha addressed | Second arrow addressed; first arrow open; global framing dissolved |
| **Buddhist relationship** | Deep resonance, not opposition | Four parallels, each with precise divergence |
| **Translation** | No liberation-language | Ground in apparatus; stance-character preserved |

The meta-question finding tells us 诗意 is not best understood AS mokṣa or as NOT mokṣa. The ground finding tells us what 诗意 IS on its own terms: the fertile condition from which lucid philosophical, creative, and practical activity naturally arises after post-metaphysical disenchantment.
