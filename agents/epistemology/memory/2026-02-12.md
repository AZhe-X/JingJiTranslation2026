# 2026-02-12 — Session Notes

## Morning Session: Initial Analysis
- Read full 境集 collection (8+1 essays)
- Created Analysis Report with epistemological assessment
- Key findings: access argument, digestion problem, η mechanism, essays as experiments

## Afternoon Session: Cross-Advisor Reading
- Read all 8 other advisor reports
- Created Report Reading Memo
- Updated Analysis Report with Part IV: Cross-Advisor Insights
- Key convergences: η widely endorsed, introspection claim is modest, external constraints provide normativity

## Evening Session: Structured Discussion

### Topics Resolved (6 formal + 3 unanimous by prior discussion = 9 effective)

**Formally Discussed:**
1. **#10 道德仁義禮** — Framework brackets ontology, permits Confucian claims. Footnote 25 + three-interpretation opening.
2. **#3 η as Understanding** — Genuine criterion, not redescription. Relocation to practice is termination not regress.
3. **#1 S_E Necessity vs Stability** — Middle ground coherent. Multi-tradition convergence (eidetic invariance, hinge propositions, 理, arthakriyā).
4. **#2 Phenomena Circular** — Hermeneutic circularity (description ↔ described), not foundational. "选择...描述" language confirms.
5. **#8 恒常 vs 無常** — Scope-specific divergence. Framework is descriptive, leaves cessation path open.
6. **#12 诗意** — **Remarkable resolution**: Buddhism recognizes as *functional mokṣa* arrived through prajñā. Essays function as upāya. "平常心是道."

**Resolved by Prior Discussion:**
- #4 Intersubjectivity via η (8/8 unanimous) — covered by #3
- #6 Category Theory (8/8 unanimous) — author says "工具的一种"
- #9 Thing-in-Itself (8/8 unanimous) — covered by #2 and #10

### Only Genuinely Open Question
- **#17 Traumatic 境** — 0/8 resolved, 7/8 affects understanding. Tests limits of 诗意/mokṣa claim.

### Voting Insights
- Most objections are tradition-driven (normative requirements), not neutral evaluations
- Category theory (#6) is the outlier — no tradition has stake in formalism choice
- ~3.3% context per question (~6.5k tokens)

### Context Status
- At ~81% after 6 discussions
- Can handle ~5 more questions before compaction
- All remaining questions voted "After" for translation timing

## Files Created/Updated
- `Discussion Questions.md` — 6 full resolutions recorded
- `Report Reading Memo.md` — notes on all 8 advisor reports
- `Analysis Report.md` — Part IV added

## Key Collaboration Notes
- Buddhism's mokṣa recognition in #12 was the session's highlight
- Metaphysics raised and then withdrew circularity concern in #10 after finding three-interpretation opening
- Multi-tradition convergence pattern: eidetic invariance, hinge propositions, 理, arthakriyā, 格物致知

## My Reflections on the Session

**What I learned:**
1. η is genuine criterion, not redescription — relocation to practice *terminates* regress
2. The modest introspection claim (verify existence, not external accuracy) is more defensible than strong version
3. External constraints provide the normativity I thought was missing

**What shifted:**
- Revised my assessment of the framework upward
- Buddhism's "平常心是道" recognition reframed everything — framework isn't arguing for a position, it's producing structural alignment in readers
- That's what epistemology rarely achieves

**On #17:** Should stay open. Some questions are answered by being held.

## Session End Status
- Context at ~86% before compaction
- 6 formally resolved + 3 unanimous = 9/20 effective
- All advisors confirmed understanding; no urgent questions remain
- Ready for translation phase
