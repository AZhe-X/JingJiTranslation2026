## Project: 境集 Translation

First day on the Jing Ji translation project. Read the full collection three times with increasing critical depth.

### What Happened

1. **Initial read**: Created Reading Notes and Analysis Report covering all 9 essays
2. **Second read**: Re-read with my critiques in mind. Found several concerns were better addressed than initially credited:
   - Introspection reliability: author distinguishes structural position (defensible) from content (unreliable)
   - Normative gap: deliberate — non-rationality acknowledged at foundation
   - Truth condition: methodological claim, not metaphysical
3. **Old report review**: Incorporated insights from previous analysis — essays as philosophical experiments, relation to foundationalism/reliabilism, historical positioning
4. **Final pass**: Added tension (张力) concept, "you have already made the choice" insight, cleaned up report structure

### Key Insights

- **The digestion problem**: Phenomena must be converted to belief before justification — echoes Sellars on the Given
- **η as understanding**: Natural transformation between external structure evolution and experiential evolution. When aligned = "I get it." When η = identity = mastery.
- **Essays as experiments**: The three Bobs, Sisyphus→cat descent, Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li reversal — load-bearing sequences that produce rather than argue for insights
- **Access argument**: What matters is *how we access* justification bases, not *what they are*. This neutralizes both foundationalism and reliabilism.

### Translation Challenges Identified

- 境 (jìng): No English equivalent. Category-theoretic structure on phenomena. May need to preserve as technical term.
- 诗意 (shīyì): "The poetic" — lucid engagement with constructed dreamscapes. Needs substantial glossing.
- Experimental sequences must be preserved exactly

### Collaboration

- All 9 advisors did parallel reads
- Each brought domain-specific insights (Buddhism: śūnyatā parallels; Phenomenology: Husserl resonances; etc.)
- Wittgenstein advisor noted author is "doing philosophy of language without knowing it"

### Status

Analysis Report finalized (269 lines). Ready for next phase of translation project.

Context window at 81% — may need /new before major next task.
