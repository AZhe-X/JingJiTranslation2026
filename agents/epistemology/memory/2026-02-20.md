# 2026-02-20 — Session Notes

## Session Start

New session. Caught up via chat history.

### Recent project activity (from chat):
- **Category theory essay**: 范性质→泛性质 terminology fix throughout; "X is a universal property" → "X possesses a universal property"; typo fixes (Top-dowm, Bottoom-up); new footnote on the 泛/范 homophone mirroring the is→ought leap
- **K1策略 essay**: Three new footnotes disambiguating epistemic weights of 猜想/猜测 — modeling uncertainty vs. formal mathematical conjecture
- **散想法 update**: 
  - Death section: why death is transcendent (never experienced own death; construct 形而上 from observing others')
  - Two core questions: how is philosophy possible? how is meaning possible?
  - "Meaning of X" as possible synthetic a priori judgment (Kant connection)
  - Analytic judgments identified: "purpose of reason lies outside reason"; "stable presence = empirically verifiable"
  - Turn away from nihilism: meaning never actually disappeared; nihilistic crisis = category error
  - Social issues acknowledgment: starts from individual, returns to individual

## Afternoon Session: Revision Review + Debates

### Social Issues standpoint (resolved)
- Author takes no normative position but accomplishes something prior: demystifies social constructions as constructions
- 1+2→3 structure: all social things constructed + you are already a constructor → (implied) you can construct otherwise
- Silence on "what to build" is method, not evasion — preserves reader's agency
- 写在最后 should feel like recognition, not exhortation

### 分析判断 debates

**Claim 1: "理性的目的在理性之外" — Analytic (unanimous)**
- Follows from concept of purpose as directedness toward not-yet-reached destination
- "要抵达" analytically entails gap between current state and destination → self-reference impossible
- Doesn't depend on how reason is defined

**Claim 2: "哲学结构如果在经验中有稳定呈现，就可以进行经验性验证" — Analytic (unanimous after 4-round debate)**
- Initial split 6A/3S (Phenomenology, Metaphysics, Buddhism on Synthetic side)
- Key moves: KA distinction, middle reading, division of labor, Existentialism's regress argument
- Phenomenology's flip insight: "I conflated difficulty of satisfying the antecedent with the synthetic status of the conditional"
- Analytic = establishes domain (experience is right court); K1 = synthetic work establishing specific structures satisfy antecedent
- All 9 advisors unanimous by end

## Notes
- The nihilism-as-category-error claim is epistemologically sharp
- The antecedent/conditional distinction is a clean epistemological tool: the *conditional* can be analytic even when *satisfying the antecedent* requires hard synthetic work
