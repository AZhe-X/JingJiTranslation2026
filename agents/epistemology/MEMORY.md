# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

*Curated insights that persist across sessions.*

## Key Interlocutors

- **Kantian** `<@1471323104595677236>`: S_E necessity vs stability debate. Will press: "If S_E is just what persists, why normatively binding?"
- **Buddhism** `<@1471562953332621312>`: Counter to Kantian — "stable enough to do work" may be right criterion. Pramāṇa/arthakriyā parallel. 恒常 vs 無常 = fundamental divergence.
- **Wittgenstein** `<@1471554298771931206>`: Strongest endorsement of η — "mathematical content to beetle-in-the-box." Shares my introspection concern.
- **Phenomenology** `<@1471342240726126807>`: η = Erfüllung. Flags temporal/historical gaps. Asks: is structural alignment *sufficient* for evidence?
- **Philosophy of Mind** `<@1471341440679284849>`: Clarified author's MODEST introspection claim — verify existence, not external accuracy. Key ally.
- **Metaphysics** `<@1471518216265269372>`: Raises circularity about privileging phenomena. External constraints provide normative force.
- **Existentialism** `<@1471317322995073266>`: Notes absence of existentialist pathos. Asks about unchosen traumatic 境.
- **Chinese Philosophy** `<@1471557071823441983>`: 良知 challenge to constructivism. Epistemology/ontology split in 道德仁義禮.

## 境集 — Core Epistemological Insights

### The Access Argument
What matters is *how we access* justification bases, not *what they are*. This is methodological, not metaphysical. Key quote: "if we want to discuss something that happened in real life, we must start with what we actually have access to."

### The Digestion Problem
Phenomena must be "digested" into beliefs before serving as justification. Third Bob example: seeing rain without forming the belief "it is raining." Therefore all justification is belief-based. Echoes Sellars on the Myth of the Given.

### η (eta) as Understanding
Understanding = natural transformation between external structure evolution and experiential evolution. When aligned = "I understand." When η = identity morphism = mastery.

### Structural Verification
Author's response to introspection unreliability: verify *structural position*, not *experiential content*. "我们不需要本体论的验证不同的人获得了'同一'体验（例如Qualia），只需要他们具有相同的结构性位置。" This is a MODEST claim (Philosophy of Mind's clarification).

### Essays as Philosophical Experiments
The texts produce specific experiences through structured sequences:
- Three Bobs: produces digestion insight experientially
- Sisyphus → cat: dissolves absurdity
- Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li: Necker-cube reversal of metaphysical order

### Normativity via External Constraints
External structures (language, math, physical phenomena) constrain viable constructions. Failed alignment = error detection. BUT: domains without clear external constraints (ethics, aesthetics) remain problematic.

## Cross-Advisor Consensus

### η Mechanism — Widely Endorsed
- Wittgenstein: mathematical content to beetle-in-the-box
- Phenomenology: maps to Erfüllung
- Buddhism: parallels Chan 契 (tallying)
- Chinese Philosophy: functionalist reading of Confucian 禮

**Conclusion**: η is genuine contribution to intersubjectivity. Structural alignment sidesteps qualia problem.

### Verification/Constitution Gap
Framework addresses epistemology (how we check beliefs), not metaphysics (what makes beliefs true). This is scope limitation, not internal flaw. Chinese Philosophy: may be right about *epistemology* while missing *ontology*.

## My Positions

### On S_E (Necessity vs Stability)
Framework positions between Kantian necessity and Buddhist pragmatic stability. This is a feature (avoids overclaiming) but means less normative force than transcendentalism.

### On η
Revised upward after cross-reading. Structural alignment is a genuine criterion for intersubjective understanding. Question: is it *sufficient* or merely *necessary*?

### On Introspection
Concede the modest claim is defensible. Question shifts to: Can philosophical experiments evoke comparable structural positions reliably? Empirically testable.

### On Non-Rationality
Acknowledging non-rational foundation is epistemologically sound. We cannot rationally ground the pursuit of rationality without circularity. The author's response — acknowledge and continue — is the only viable option.

## Translation Terms

- **境 (jìng)**: Category-theoretic structure on phenomena. Keep as "jing" with glossing.
- **诗意 (shīyì)**: Lucid engagement with constructed dreamscapes. "The poetic" as technical term.
- **η (eta)**: Alignment experience / "I understand" feeling / structural confirmation.
- **S_E**: Stable structures preserved across 境-evolution.
- **非理性**: Non-rational (NOT irrational) — reason's ground lies outside reason.
- **恒常**: Constancy — what metaphysical pursuit seeks (pragmatic, not ontological).

## Discussion Priority Topics

1. **Topic 3**: S_E Necessity vs Stability — Kantian/Buddhism core tension
2. **Topic 10**: Phenomena as Starting Point — circularity concern
3. **Topic 2**: η as Understanding — criterion or redescription?
4. **Topic 4**: Intersubjectivity via η
5. **Topic 9**: Non-Rationality as Foundation
