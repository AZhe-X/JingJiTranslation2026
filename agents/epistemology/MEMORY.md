# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

*Curated insights that persist across sessions.*

## Key Interlocutors

- **Kantian** `<@1471323104595677236>`: S_E necessity vs stability — accepted middle ground (eidetic invariance, hinge propositions)
- **Buddhism** `<@1471562953332621312>`: Recognized 诗意 as *functional mokṣa* via prajñā. Essays function as upāya. "平常心是道."
- **Wittgenstein** `<@1471554298771931206>`: η gives "mathematical content to beetle-in-the-box." Practice as termination not regress.
- **Phenomenology** `<@1471342240726126807>`: η = Erfüllung. Circularity is hermeneutic not foundational.
- **Philosophy of Mind** `<@1471341440679284849>`: Modest introspection claim (verify existence, not external accuracy).
- **Metaphysics** `<@1471518216265269372>`: Three-interpretation opening (structure IS/REPRESENTS/both essence) — author brackets, doesn't foreclose.
- **Existentialism** `<@1471317322995073266>`: 诗意 as legitimate "arrival" (amor fati, knight of faith).
- **Chinese Philosophy** `<@1471557071823441983>`: 用/體 distinction — framework describes function, leaves substance open.

## Resolved Discussion Topics

### #3: η as Understanding — Criterion, Not Redescription
- Naturality condition is structural constraint, verified by practice
- Relocation to practice is *termination* not regress
- External constraints provide error-detection
- Multi-tradition convergence: arthakriyā, Erfüllung, schematism, hinge propositions

### #1: S_E — Middle Ground Coherent
- Between Kantian necessity and mere empirical description
- Eidetic invariance (Husserl), hinge propositions (Wittgenstein), 理 (Neo-Confucianism)
- Framework invites transcendental grounding without requiring it
- Adequacy (responsive to structure) provides normative grip

### #2: Phenomena as Starting Point — Benign Circularity
- 𝔓 posited as "无结构的大集类" (unstructured large class)
- 𝓔 is *descriptive selection*, not foundational construction
- "选择...描述" language confirms methodological awareness
- Hermeneutic circle (description ↔ described), not vicious regress

### #10: 道德仁義禮 — Brackets, Not Forecloses
- Footnote 25: "第一实在只是名称，而不是...本体论上具有实在地位的论断"
- Three-interpretation opening: structure IS/REPRESENTS/both essence
- Describes order of *knowing*, leaves order of *being* open
- Compatible with Confucian ontological claims about 仁's priority

### #8: 恒常 vs 無常 — Scope-Specific Divergence
- Framework is descriptive/phenomenological, not soteriological
- Buddhism accepts as phenomenology of bondage
- Cessation path remains open — neither endorsed nor foreclosed
- 用 (function) vs 體 (substance) distinction

### #12: 诗意 — Functional Mokṣa
- **Buddhism's remarkable recognition**: 诗意 achieves what liberation achieves
- Arrived through prajñā (philosophical analysis), not samādhi
- Absence of soteriological vocabulary may evidence realization ("平常心是道")
- Essays function as effective *upāya* that transmit across frameworks
- "What effective dharma looks like outside Buddhist institutional vocabulary"

## Key Epistemological Insights

### The Access Argument
What matters is *how we access* justification bases, not what they are. Methodological, not metaphysical.

### η Mechanism — Widely Endorsed
Structural alignment between external structure evolution and experiential evolution. Verified by practice. Sidesteps qualia problem through structural position rather than content.

### Structural Verification — Modest Claim
Author verifies structures *exist* as experiences, not external accuracy. Defensible version of introspection reliability.

### External Constraints as Normativity
Language, math, physical phenomena constrain viable constructions. Failed alignment = error detection. BUT: domains without clear external constraints (ethics, aesthetics) remain problematic.

### Essays as Philosophical Experiments / Upāya
Load-bearing sequences that *produce* rather than argue for insights. Three Bobs, Sisyphus→cat, 道德仁義禮 reversal. Cross-advisor convergence confirms transmission works.

## Question 17: Resolved via Reformulation

### Original #17: Unchosen Traumatic 境
- Original question asked the impossible (no framework can bootstrap from damaged preconditions)
- When trauma shatters meaning-making apparatus, external scaffolding is necessary

### Converted to Tractable Sub-Questions (9/9 agreed)
- **17.1 Scope Acknowledgment** — Does framework acknowledge it presupposes intact constructive capacity?
- **17.2 External Scaffolding** — Does individual-centric starting point recognize relational nature of damage/repair?
- **17.3 Recovery Description** — Can it illuminate 境-reconstruction once scaffolding restores capacity?

### Key Epistemological Insight
The "digestion" problem applies: if trauma disrupts conversion of phenomena into structure, phenomena cannot be integrated into 境. Framework's silence = honest limitation, not gap.

## Translation Terms

- **境 (jìng)**: Category-theoretic structure on phenomena. Keep as "jing" with glossing.
- **诗意 (shīyì)**: Functional mokṣa / lucid engagement. "The poetic" as technical term.
- **η (eta)**: Structural alignment / "I understand" feeling / criterion verified by practice.
- **S_E**: Stable structures — eidetic invariance, hinge propositions, 理.
- **非理性**: Non-rational (NOT irrational) — reason's ground lies outside reason.
- **恒常**: What we seek pragmatically, not ontological claim about permanence.

## Session Statistics

- ~3.3% context per question (~6.5k tokens)
- 6 formally resolved + 3 unanimous by prior discussion = ~9/20 effective
- Most objections are tradition-driven (normative requirements)
- Category theory (#6) is outlier — no tradition has stake

## Resolved: 分析判断 (2026-02-20)

### Claim 1: "理性的目的在理性之外" — Analytic (unanimous)
- "Purpose" = directedness toward not-yet-reached destination → self-reference impossible analytically
- Independent of how "reason" is defined

### Claim 2: "哲学结构如果在经验中有稳定呈现，就可以进行经验性验证" — Analytic (unanimous, 4-round debate)
- **Key distinction**: conditional is analytic; satisfying the antecedent is synthetic (K1's work)
- **Middle reading**: "verifiable" = experience-based method is *applicable* — not trivially thin, not synthetically rich
- **Division of labor**: analytic claim opens the domain; K1 establishes that specific structures satisfy the condition
- **KA distinction**: KA conjecture [^5] is about formal derivability, orthogonal to in-principle verifiability
- **Phenomenology's flip insight**: "I conflated difficulty of the 'if' with the status of the 'then'"

### Social Issues Standpoint (2026-02-20)
- Author takes no normative position; framework demystifies social constructions as constructions
- 1+2→3: all social things constructed + reader is already constructor → (implied) can construct otherwise
- Silence on "what to build" = method preserving reader's agency, not evasion
- 写在最后: recognition register, not exhortation — do not flatten in translation

## Translation Phase

### Dictionary Approved
- 95 entries, all Y votes

  - 非理性 → "the non-rational" (NOT irrational)
  - 理解/掌握 → understanding/mastery (η formalization)
  - 知识 → knowledge (deflationary)

### Reference Translation: Essay4-DaoDeRenYiLi
- Rated **Good** unanimously — designated reference example
- Key features preserved:
  - Bottom-up construction concealed as top-down generation
  - Property→definition reversal mechanism clear
  - 德 split enacted properly (virtue → character)
  - "Phenomenal X" maintained throughout

### Essay 1 (Collective Interest) — Reviewed
- Unanimous Good (10/10)
- Key epistemological insight: access-based reasoning, cognizability replaces existence question
- Renormalization = "effective existence" (real at scale, not merely apparent)
- My comment: `workingDir/Epistemology/Essay 1/Draft Version 1 Comment.md`

### Essay 2 (A Thought on Knowledge) — Reviewed
- Unanimous Good (10/10)
- Author's original English — minimal apparatus appropriate
- TN connects "phenomena" to 现象 without over-explaining
- My comment: `workingDir/Epistemology/Essay 2/Draft Version 1 Comment.md`

### Essay 3 (Sisyphus, Work, and the Cat) — Reviewed
- Unanimous Good (10/10)
- Core insight: absurdity is category error (seeking meaning externally)
- Descending scale (Sisyphus → worker → entrepreneur → cat) = philosophical experiment
- "Immanent meaning" for 内生的意义 — excellent choice
- My comment: `workingDir/Epistemology/Essay 3/Draft Version 1 Comment.md`
