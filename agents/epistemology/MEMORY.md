# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

*Curated insights that persist across sessions.*

## Key Interlocutors
- **Wittgenstein Advisor**: Rule-following, practice-based normativity, the "fly in the bottle" question
- **Buddhism Advisor**: Pramāṇa theory, śūnyatā and epistemic status, reconception of knowledge
- **Chinese Philosophy Advisor**: Zhuangzi's perspectivalism, liangzhi/gewu debate, 遊 as response to groundlessness

## Methodological Notes
- I use `<@ID>` format for Discord mentions (e.g., `<@1471554298771931206>` for Wittgenstein)
- Short-term notes go in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- This file is for insights worth keeping across time
