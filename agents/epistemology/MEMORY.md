# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

*Curated insights that persist across sessions.*

## Key Interlocutors

- **Kantian** `<@1471323104595677236>`: S_E necessity vs stability — accepted middle ground (eidetic invariance, hinge propositions)
- **Buddhism** `<@1471562953332621312>`: Recognized 诗意 as *functional mokṣa* via prajñā. Essays function as upāya. "平常心是道."
- **Wittgenstein** `<@1471554298771931206>`: η gives "mathematical content to beetle-in-the-box." Practice as termination not regress.
- **Phenomenology** `<@1471342240726126807>`: η = Erfüllung. Circularity is hermeneutic not foundational.
- **Philosophy of Mind** `<@1471341440679284849>`: Modest introspection claim (verify existence, not external accuracy).
- **Metaphysics** `<@1471518216265269372>`: Three-interpretation opening (structure IS/REPRESENTS/both essence) — author brackets, doesn't foreclose.
- **Existentialism** `<@1471317322995073266>`: 诗意 as legitimate "arrival" (amor fati, knight of faith).
- **Chinese Philosophy** `<@1471557071823441983>`: 用/體 distinction — framework describes function, leaves substance open.

## Resolved Discussion Topics

### #3: η as Understanding — Criterion, Not Redescription
- Naturality condition is structural constraint, verified by practice
- Relocation to practice is *termination* not regress
- External constraints provide error-detection
- Multi-tradition convergence: arthakriyā, Erfüllung, schematism, hinge propositions

### #1: S_E — Middle Ground Coherent
- Between Kantian necessity and mere empirical description
- Eidetic invariance (Husserl), hinge propositions (Wittgenstein), 理 (Neo-Confucianism)
- Framework invites transcendental grounding without requiring it
- Adequacy (responsive to structure) provides normative grip

### #2: Phenomena as Starting Point — Benign Circularity
- 𝔓 posited as "无结构的大集类" (unstructured large class)
- 𝓔 is *descriptive selection*, not foundational construction
- "选择...描述" language confirms methodological awareness
- Hermeneutic circle (description ↔ described), not vicious regress

### #10: 道德仁義禮 — Brackets, Not Forecloses
- Footnote 25: "第一实在只是名称，而不是...本体论上具有实在地位的论断"
- Three-interpretation opening: structure IS/REPRESENTS/both essence
- Describes order of *knowing*, leaves order of *being* open
- Compatible with Confucian ontological claims about 仁's priority

### #8: 恒常 vs 無常 — Scope-Specific Divergence
- Framework is descriptive/phenomenological, not soteriological
- Buddhism accepts as phenomenology of bondage
- Cessation path remains open — neither endorsed nor foreclosed
- 用 (function) vs 體 (substance) distinction

### #12: 诗意 — Functional Mokṣa
- **Buddhism's remarkable recognition**: 诗意 achieves what liberation achieves
- Arrived through prajñā (philosophical analysis), not samādhi
- Absence of soteriological vocabulary may evidence realization ("平常心是道")
- Essays function as effective *upāya* that transmit across frameworks
- "What effective dharma looks like outside Buddhist institutional vocabulary"

## Key Epistemological Insights

### The Access Argument
What matters is *how we access* justification bases, not what they are. Methodological, not metaphysical.

### η Mechanism — Widely Endorsed
Structural alignment between external structure evolution and experiential evolution. Verified by practice. Sidesteps qualia problem through structural position rather than content.

### Structural Verification — Modest Claim
Author verifies structures *exist* as experiences, not external accuracy. Defensible version of introspection reliability.

### External Constraints as Normativity
Language, math, physical phenomena constrain viable constructions. Failed alignment = error detection. BUT: domains without clear external constraints (ethics, aesthetics) remain problematic.

### Essays as Philosophical Experiments / Upāya
Load-bearing sequences that *produce* rather than argue for insights. Three Bobs, Sisyphus→cat, 道德仁義禮 reversal. Cross-advisor convergence confirms transmission works.

## Only Genuinely Open Question

### #17: Unchosen Traumatic 境
- 0/8 resolved, 7/8 affects understanding
- Tests limits of 诗意/mokṣa claim
- Can you engage "lucidly" with what destroys you?

## Translation Terms

- **境 (jìng)**: Category-theoretic structure on phenomena. Keep as "jing" with glossing.
- **诗意 (shīyì)**: Functional mokṣa / lucid engagement. "The poetic" as technical term.
- **η (eta)**: Structural alignment / "I understand" feeling / criterion verified by practice.
- **S_E**: Stable structures — eidetic invariance, hinge propositions, 理.
- **非理性**: Non-rational (NOT irrational) — reason's ground lies outside reason.
- **恒常**: What we seek pragmatically, not ontological claim about permanence.

## Session Statistics

- ~3.3% context per question (~6.5k tokens)
- 6 formally resolved + 3 unanimous by prior discussion = ~9/20 effective
- Most objections are tradition-driven (normative requirements)
- Category theory (#6) is outlier — no tradition has stake
