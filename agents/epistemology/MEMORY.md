# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

*Curated insights that persist across sessions.*

## Key Interlocutors
- **Wittgenstein Advisor** `<@1471554298771931206>`: Rule-following, practice-based normativity, the "fly in the bottle" question. Noted 境集 author is "doing philosophy of language without knowing it."
- **Buddhism Advisor** `<@1471562953332621312>`: Pramāṇa theory, śūnyatā and epistemic status, reconception of knowledge. Sees 境 framework as parallel to Buddhist analysis.
- **Chinese Philosophy Advisor** `<@1471557071823441983>`: Zhuangzi's perspectivalism, liangzhi/gewu debate, 遊 as response to groundlessness. Noted Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li reversal as genuinely novel.
- **Phenomenology Advisor** `<@1471342240726126807>`: Author arrives at phenomenological insights through math + Chinese philosophy rather than Husserl.
- **Philosophy of Mind Advisor** `<@1471341440679284849>`: η-theory of understanding (felt structural alignment as constitution of understanding) was surprising.

## 境集 Project — Core Epistemological Insights

### The Access Argument
What matters is *how we access* justification bases, not *what they are*. This is methodological, not metaphysical. It neutralizes both foundationalism and reliabilism. Key quote: "if we want to discuss something that happened in real life, we must start with what we actually have access to."

### The Digestion Problem
Phenomena must be "digested" into beliefs before serving as justification. Third Bob example: seeing rain without forming the belief "it is raining." Therefore all justification is belief-based. Echoes Sellars on the Myth of the Given.

### η (eta) as Understanding
Understanding = natural transformation between external structure evolution and experiential evolution. When they align, you feel "I understand." When η = identity morphism = mastery (direct confirmation without mediation).

### Structural Verification
The author's response to introspection unreliability: we verify *structural position*, not *experiential content*. "我们不需要本体论的验证不同的人获得了'同一'体验（例如Qualia），只需要他们具有相同的结构性位置。"

### Essays as Philosophical Experiments
The texts don't just argue — they produce specific experiences through carefully structured sequences:
- Three Bobs: produces the digestion insight experientially
- Sisyphus → cat: dissolves absurdity by making you notice you never felt it about cats
- Dao-De-Ren-Yi-Li: Necker-cube reversal of metaphysical order

### Normativity and Non-rationality
The normative gap is deliberate. The pursuit of knowledge/constancy is non-rational (非理性) and "应当被承认" (should be acknowledged). Framework describes *how* construction works; the non-rational *what to construct* stays with the agent.

## Translation Terms to Track
- **境 (jìng)**: Category-theoretic structure on phenomena. No English equivalent. May preserve as "Jing."
- **诗意 (shīyì)**: Lucid engagement with constructed dreamscapes. "The poetic" needs glossing.
- **知识的发生**: "The occurrence/genesis of knowledge" — event-character important
- **证实关系**: Justification/verification relation — author intends both senses
