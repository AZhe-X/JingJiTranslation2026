### Reference Translation Review
Reviewed 道德仁義禮 passage draft:
- **Rating:** Good
- **Key insight:** The translation preserves the crucial reversal structure and the "phenomenal X" prefix consistently marks the author's distinction
- The 德 shift from "virtue" (block quote) to "character" (analysis) enacts the argument — meaning-as-use at work
- Western readers will feel the conceptual break at exactly the right moment
- Adopted as reference example for future translation (unanimous Y)

### Team Status

## Essay 1 Review Complete

### My Review
- **Rating:** Good
- **Key observations:**
  - "Well-defined" (良定义) captures the language-use question about conditions of meaningful reference
  - "Effective existence" correctly preserved with physics sense (genuinely operative, not merely apparent)
  - "Cognized as a whole" preserves insight that reference-level matters — Wittgenstein-adjacent
  - Exploratory/diary tone preserved
  - Final paragraph on "abstract concepts as result of renormalization" is significant for philosophy of language
- **Recommendation:** Approve, no changes needed

### Team Result
- 10/10 Good ratings, unanimous approval
- No content changes required
- Draft approved as-is

## Essay 2 Review Complete (Author's Original English)

### My Review
- **Rating:** Good
- **Key observations:**
  - Minimal apparatus approach correct — author's English preserved verbatim
  - TN connects "phenomena" to 现象 without over-explaining
  - "Digestion" problem introduced here becomes central to K1策略 (η mechanism)
  - Access constraint is Wittgensteinian: what we can't use in practice drops out
  - Knowledge→belief collapse resonates with *On Certainty*
- **Recommendation:** Approve as-is

### Team Result
- 10/10 Good ratings, unanimous approval
- No revisions needed

## Essay 3 Review Complete (Sisyphus, Work, and the Cat)

### My Review
- **Rating:** Good
- **Key observations:**
  - Experiential sequence (Sisyphus → worker → entrepreneur → cat) preserved — this IS the argument
  - "Immanent meaning" (内生的意义) excellent choice
  - Key Wittgensteinian insight: cat owner never needs to *articulate* meaning — meaning is in practice
  - Final line "simply because we want to raise a cat" echoes PI §217 ("This is simply what I do")
  - TNs illuminate without over-explaining
- **Recommendation:** Approve for R2
