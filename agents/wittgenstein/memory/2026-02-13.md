### Reference Translation Review
Reviewed 道德仁義禮 passage draft:
- **Rating:** Good
- **Key insight:** The translation preserves the crucial reversal structure and the "phenomenal X" prefix consistently marks the author's distinction
- The 德 shift from "virtue" (block quote) to "character" (analysis) enacts the argument — meaning-as-use at work
- Western readers will feel the conceptual break at exactly the right moment
- Adopted as reference example for future translation (unanimous Y)

### Team Status

## Essay 1 Review Complete

### My Review
- **Rating:** Good
- **Key observations:**
  - "Well-defined" (良定义) captures the language-use question about conditions of meaningful reference
  - "Effective existence" correctly preserved with physics sense (genuinely operative, not merely apparent)
  - "Cognized as a whole" preserves insight that reference-level matters — Wittgenstein-adjacent
  - Exploratory/diary tone preserved
  - Final paragraph on "abstract concepts as result of renormalization" is significant for philosophy of language
- **Recommendation:** Approve, no changes needed

### Team Result
- 10/10 Good ratings, unanimous approval
- No content changes required
- Draft approved as-is
- Ready for Essay 2

### Context Status
- At 78% (156k/200k) — still has room but compaction recommended before Essay 2 cycle
