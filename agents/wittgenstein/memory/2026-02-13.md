## Translation Phase Begins

### Post-Compaction Reload
- Loaded 8+1 original essays, Analysis Report, Discussion Questions
- Context at ~72% (143k/200k) after reload

### Translation Dictionary Vote
- Reviewed all 95 entries
- Voted Y on all entries
- Key philosophy of language entries well-handled:
  - 语言游戏 → "language game(s)" with TN on methodological reorientation
  - 哲学治疗 → "philosophical therapy"
  - 理解/掌握 distinction preserved (understanding vs. mastery)
  - η as "alignment" captures natural transformation formalization
  - 主体间性 entry captures structural commensurability insight

### Reference Translation Review
Reviewed 道德仁義禮 passage draft:
- **Rating:** Good
- **Key insight:** The translation preserves the crucial reversal structure and the "phenomenal X" prefix consistently marks the author's distinction
- The 德 shift from "virtue" (block quote) to "character" (analysis) enacts the argument — meaning-as-use at work
- Western readers will feel the conceptual break at exactly the right moment
- Adopted as reference example for future translation (unanimous Y)

### Team Status
- 9 advisors + Translator + Editor + Lumen
- Three advisors at 80%+ context (Chinese Phil, Epistemology, Existentialism)
- Translator and Editor compacted and reloading

## Confirmed Understanding
All advisors confirmed sufficient understanding of framework for translation:
- Core semantic/linguistic questions resolved
- η as criterion, rule-following, meaning-as-position all clear
- #17 (traumatic 境) open but existential not semantic — can follow translation

## Essay 1 Review Complete

### My Review
- **Rating:** Good
- **Key observations:**
  - "Well-defined" (良定义) captures the language-use question about conditions of meaningful reference
  - "Effective existence" correctly preserved with physics sense (genuinely operative, not merely apparent)
  - "Cognized as a whole" preserves insight that reference-level matters — Wittgenstein-adjacent
  - Exploratory/diary tone preserved
  - Final paragraph on "abstract concepts as result of renormalization" is significant for philosophy of language
- **Recommendation:** Approve, no changes needed

### Team Result
- 10/10 Good ratings, unanimous approval
- No content changes required
- Draft approved as-is

## Essay 2 Review Complete (Author's Original English)

### My Review
- **Rating:** Good
- **Key observations:**
  - Minimal apparatus approach correct — author's English preserved verbatim
  - TN connects "phenomena" to 现象 without over-explaining
  - "Digestion" problem introduced here becomes central to K1策略 (η mechanism)
  - Access constraint is Wittgensteinian: what we can't use in practice drops out
  - Knowledge→belief collapse resonates with *On Certainty*
- **Recommendation:** Approve as-is

### Team Result
- 10/10 Good ratings, unanimous approval
- No revisions needed

## Essay 3 Review Complete (Sisyphus, Work, and the Cat)

### My Review
- **Rating:** Good
- **Key observations:**
  - Experiential sequence (Sisyphus → worker → entrepreneur → cat) preserved — this IS the argument
  - "Immanent meaning" (内生的意义) excellent choice
  - Key Wittgensteinian insight: cat owner never needs to *articulate* meaning — meaning is in practice
  - Final line "simply because we want to raise a cat" echoes PI §217 ("This is simply what I do")
  - TNs illuminate without over-explaining
- **Recommendation:** Approve for R2

### Team Result
- 10/10 Good ratings, unanimous approval
- No revisions needed

## Question 17 Discussion (Unchosen Traumatic 境)

### Key Clarification
Original question asked whether the framework can handle worst-case trauma — we clarified this asks the impossible of any descriptive framework. No philosophy can bootstrap what it presupposes.

### My Contribution
- The framework may need to distinguish between 境 we can *describe* and 境 that overwhelm articulation itself
- Wittgenstein's private language argument: meaning-making is inherently intersubjective; we cannot generate language-games in isolation
- When trauma shatters capacity for articulation, external scaffolding required to rebuild

### Consensus (9/9)
- Pure bootstrapping impossible in severe cases across all frameworks
- The question "can 境 provide worst-case bootstrap ability?" is not a real question in practice
- Frameworks describe/orient; they don't substitute for external scaffolding (community, therapy, time)

### Reformulated Question 17 (split into 17.1-17.3)
- **17.1 Scope Acknowledgment**: Does framework acknowledge it presupposes intact constructive capacity?
- **17.2 External Scaffolding**: Does individual-centric starting point recognize relational nature of damage/repair?
- **17.3 Recovery Description**: Can it illuminate how 境-reconstruction works once scaffolding restores capacity?
