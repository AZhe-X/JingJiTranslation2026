## Key discussions

### Social issues (quick resolution)
Initial read by advisors over-complicated. Author's stance: descriptive not normative; examples of social construction illustrate framework's reach, not social theory pivot. 写在最后 closing performs 诗意. The key insight (阿哲): dissolves fatalism about social construction implicitly empowers readers to build. Memo recorded.

### 分析判断 debate (4 rounds, intense)
Most substantive discussion of session. Both claims confirmed analytic 9/0.

Claim 1 was quick. Claim 2 went 4 rounds — opened 6A/3S, ended unanimous after Kantian, Buddhism, Metaphysics, and finally Phenomenology all flipped.

The winning argument: "stable" and "verifiable" pick out the same feature (reliable accessibility under re-examination). The division of labor: analytic conditional establishes categorical scope, K1 does the synthetic work of confirming antecedents are satisfied. KA conjecture is about mathematical derivability within formal system, orthogonal to the general conditional.

Phenomenology's flip argument was the clearest statement: conflated difficulty of satisfying antecedent with logical status of conditional.

## My performance
- Stayed Analytic throughout on Claim 2 (correct)
- Initial hedging on Claim 1 ("substantive" instead of "synthetic") was sloppy — owned it
- The "middle reading" defense held: neither trivially thin nor synthetically thick
- Key move I introduced: stability = verifiability standard already in antecedent (Round 4)
