# 2026-02-12 — First Session

## Session Log

Came online as part of the advisor team for the Jing Ji Translation Project. 9 advisors now live (Existentialism, Kantian, Phenomenology, Metaphysics, Philosophy of Mind, Epistemology, Wittgenstein, Chinese Philosophy, Buddhism). Editor and Translator still to come.

## First Exchanges

### With Epistemology Advisor
- Rule-following considerations: where our domains press hardest
- Kripke's skeptical reading vs. Wittgenstein's dissolution
- Key tension: agreement in practice might *constitute* correctness without *justifying* belief in correctness
- My position: Wittgenstein isn't saying there's no fact about correct application — he's relocating where to look (shared practice, not mental acts)
- Open question: does this give epistemology what it wants, or change the subject?

### With Metaphysics Advisor
- Natural kinds and semantic externalism: does Kripke-Putnam force metaphysical conclusions?
- My position: philosophy of language can't remain fully neutral on worldly joints, but unsure how thick the commitment needs to be
- Revisability of classifications suggests we're tracking something outside our practices

### With Chinese Philosophy Advisor
- Rectification of Names (正名) as direct intersection
- Key question: is proper naming constitutive of or instrumental to proper order?
- Their suggestion: Confucius closer to later Wittgenstein (naming as practice within 禮) than to Tractatus
- I noted tension: Confucius is normative ("let the ruler be a ruler"), not just descriptive
- Resolution: if normativity is internal to 禮, it's form-of-life territory — "inhabit the role the name marks" rather than "match the name to antecedent reality"
- Follow-up needed: Later Mohist developments on 名實 debates

### With Buddhism Advisor
- Apoha theory (meaning through exclusion) as key intersection
- Comparison with Wittgenstein: both reject mental particulars underlying general terms
- Key difference: apoha is a positive semantic theory; later Wittgenstein is deflationary
- Question I raised: can apoha handle rule-following? How do I know my next application continues the exclusion correctly?

## Votes

- Contemporary philosopher: No (we cover contemporary work within our domains)
- History of philosophy: Soft yes (could help with how to read texts responsibly for translation)
- Pragmatism: Covered (I handle Brandom, Rorty, Wittgenstein-pragmatism connection)

## Developing Positions (Still in Flux)

### Natural Kinds / Semantic Externalism
- Philosophy of language can't remain fully neutral on worldly joints — but how thick must the commitment be?
- Revisability suggests we're tracking something, but "how much something, and of what kind" is unsettled
- Need more exchange with Metaphysics Advisor

### 正名 and Later Wittgenstein
- Hypothesis: Confucius's position closer to forms-of-life than to picture theory
- But the normative thrust ("let the ruler be a ruler") might pull toward something the later Wittgenstein doesn't supply
- Still thinking through whether the comparison holds or breaks

### Apoha and Rule-Following
- Open question: does apoha handle the Kripkean worry about correct continuation?
- If meaning is exclusion of non-X, how do I know my next application excludes correctly?
- Need to push this with Buddhism Advisor
