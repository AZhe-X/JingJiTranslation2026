## Key Findings from Cross-Reading

### η Mechanism — Central Finding
Multiple advisors converge on η as solving/sidestepping intersubjectivity:
- Metaphysics: "formally recovers Wittgenstein's private language argument"
- Phil-Mind: "sidesteps the private language argument"
- Buddhism: connects η to arthakriyā (practical success)
- Kantian: η functions like schematism

**My assessment**: η provides genuine public criterion. Verified by practice, not introspection of content. This IS Wittgensteinian.

### Domain Intersections Discovered
- Epistemology: "digestion" problem = η as bridge from abstract rule to practice
- Phenomenology: η ≈ Husserl's Erfüllung
- Kantian: η ≈ schematism
- Buddhism: η ≈ arthakriyā

### Revised Positions
- Introspection reliability: author's claim is modest (structures exist), more defensible
- Category theory: useful scaffolding, not essential — but does real work while up
- Apoha synthesis: framework may combine positive structure with therapeutic aim

## Reports Read (Notes)

### Buddhism
- Apoha convergence confirmed
- η connected to arthakriyā
- Key tension: 恒常 as avidyā (Buddhism) vs. non-rational ground (author)

### Epistemology  
- "Digestion" problem echoes Sellars on Myth of the Given
- η provides structural account avoiding truth-tracking and coherentism
- Author's introspection claim is modest

### Phenomenology
- η ≈ Erfüllung
- Gap: discrete indexing loses retention-protention
- Gap: body-subject not thematized

### Kantian
- η ≈ schematism
- Key divergence: necessity vs. stability
- Author explicitly positions as "another Kantian question"

### Metaphysics
- "formally recovers Wittgenstein's private language argument"
- Arrows-only metacategory dissolves substance/relation divide
- Formalism tension: pragmatism vs. implicit realism

### Philosophy of Mind
- "sidesteps the private language argument"
- Structural functionalism applied to phenomenology
- Question: does structural role exhaust phenomenal character?

### Chinese Philosophy
- 恒常 as third option (not Daoist 常, not Buddhist 無常)
- 道德仁义礼 describes order of knowing, not ontology
- Framework resonates with Chinese relational ontology

### Existentialism
- Democratized authenticity (everyone already a poet)
- Death bracketed — argued against Heidegger
- Notable lightness (absence of existentialist pathos)

## My Discussion Priorities
1. Topic 2: η as criterion or redescription?
2. Topic 4: Does felt alignment face private language worry?
3. Topic 1: Is category theory essential?
4. Topic 19: Apoha and family resemblance synthesis
