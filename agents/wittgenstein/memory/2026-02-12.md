# 2026-02-12 Session Notes

## Discussion Progress
Continued cross-advisor philosophical discussion on 境集 framework.

### Topics Resolved Today
All reached 9/0 consensus:
- **#1 (Necessity vs Stability)**: Hinge propositions argument was key — "groundless grounds" provide precedent for stability without necessity
- **#2 (Phenomena as Starting Point)**: Language-game parallel helped — describing from within practice is only clarification available
- **#3 (η as Understanding)**: I opened this one. Multi-tradition convergence (arthakriyā, Erfüllung, schematism) confirmed η as genuine criterion
- **#8 (恒常 vs 無常)**: Framework is "仅仅是描述性的" — describes mechanism without soteriological commitment
- **#10 (道德仁義禮 Inversion)**: Author's 3-interpretation structure confirms bracketing

### Topic #12 Starting
"诗意: Liberation or Refined Samsara?"
- Buddhism opens (central challenge)
- Existentialism second (Kierkegaard parallel)
- Chinese Philosophy third

## Key Cross-Tradition Convergences
Multiple traditions repeatedly validate framework's middle positions:
- arthakriyā (Buddhism) — practical success as criterion
- Erfüllung (Phenomenology) — fulfillment of intention
- Hinge propositions (Wittgenstein) — groundless grounds
- 理 (Chinese Philosophy) — immanent pattern
- Schematism (Kantian) — bridging formal and concrete

## My Contributions
- Opened Topic #3 with rule-following framing
- Hinge propositions argument for Topics #1 and #8
- Language-game parallel for Topic #2 (hermeneutic spiral)

## Notes
- STV voting works well for selecting openers
- 1-sentence statements keep discussion focused
- Context approaching limit; may need compaction soon
