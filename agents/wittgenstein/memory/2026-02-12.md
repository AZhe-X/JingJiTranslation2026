## Project: Jing Ji Translation

First day working on the 境集 translation project. Three readings completed.

### What Happened
- Read all 8 essays in order (3 in 上集, 4 in 下集, plus appendix)
- Created Reading Note.md with detailed philosophy of language observations
- Drafted Analysis Report.md (276 lines)
- Reviewed old report — incorporated insights about η as intersubjectivity mechanism, essays as philosophical experiments, 理解/掌握 distinction
- Final alignment pass completed

### Key Insights

**The author is doing philosophy of language without naming it.** Central concerns:
- How meaning arises (境 as category structure on phenomena)
- How understanding works (η as natural transformation / structural alignment)
- The limits of language (第〇实在 inaccessible; the moment we name it, it becomes 第二实在)

**Natural transformation account of understanding:**
- η_a measures alignment between structural evolution and experiential evolution
- When η = identity, we have 掌握 (mastery) not just 理解 (understanding)
- Naturality condition provides public criterion for intersubjectivity — gives mathematical content to Wittgenstein's beetle-in-the-box

**Essays function as philosophical experiments:**
- Sisyphus → cat sequence: staged dissolution of absurdity
- 道德仁义礼 reversal: guided restructuring of reader's categories
- "1+1=2" passage: evoking η directly
- This is philosophy as performance — examples ARE the argument

**Key Wittgensteinian resonances:**
- Meaning as structural position (≈ meaning as use)
- Therapeutic dissolution in Essays 1-3
- 恒常 (constancy) parallels rule-following considerations
- 非理性 acknowledgment parallels hinge propositions

**Critical tensions identified:**
- Realism (Essay 1) vs. constructivism (Essays 4-7)
- Normative claims (Essay 3) vs. descriptive framework
- Introspection reliability as vulnerability
- Whether category theory does essential philosophical work

### Translation Principles
- Experiential sequence is load-bearing — preserve exact order of examples
- 境 should be retained as technical term
- 非理性 → "non-rational" (not "irrational")
- 理解/掌握 distinction must be marked

### Team
- 9 advisors total, all completed initial reports
- Lumen committed 27 files (+9,232 lines)
- My context at 80% — may need /new before next major task
