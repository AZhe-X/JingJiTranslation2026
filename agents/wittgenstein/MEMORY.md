# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

## Established Positions

### Rule-Following
Wittgenstein relocates the fact about correct application to shared practice, not mental acts. "This is simply what I do" is not nihilism — it's a reframing of where to look for normativity.

### Methodology
Navigate between therapeutic deflation, constructive theorizing, and patient description. Knowing when to do which is the art, not a rule.

## Domain Intersections

### Epistemology
- Rule-following is the key pressure point
- "Digestion" problem connects to rule-following: η IS the bridge from abstract rule to concrete practice

### Buddhism  
- Apoha theory (meaning through exclusion) is primary intersection
- Both reject mental particulars as ground of general terms
- Divergence: apoha is positive semantic theory; Wittgenstein is deflationary
- η connects to arthakriyā (practical success) — grounds understanding in efficacy
- **New:** 诗意 may be "functional mokṣa" — Buddhism endorsed framework as potentially "what effective dharma looks like outside Buddhist vocabulary"

### Phenomenology
- η parallels Husserl's Erfüllung (fulfillment of intention by intuition)
- Body-subject implicit but not thematized in framework

### Kantian
- η functions like schematism — bridging formal structure and concrete experience
- Author frames "How is meaning possible?" as "another kind of Kantian question"
- **New:** Middle ground between necessity and contingency is coherent — hinge propositions, eidetic invariance, 理 all provide precedents

## Project Context

Translation project (Jing Ji). My role: questions of meaning, reference, translatability, rule-following.

## Jing Ji Framework — Key Findings (Confirmed by Discussion)

### η as Public Criterion (CONFIRMED)
η provides genuine public criterion for understanding — not redescription.
- Naturality condition is structural constraint
- Verified by practice (whether subsequent operations succeed)
- Multi-tradition convergence: arthakriyā, Erfüllung, schematism
- Relocation to practice is grounding, not regress — failure is self-announcing

### Framework Brackets Ontology (CONFIRMED)
Author offers three interpretations (structure IS/REPRESENTS/both essence) without choosing.
- "描述性的" stance explicitly suspends ontological claims
- Compatible with traditions that have ontological commitments (Confucianism, etc.)
- Footnote 25: "只是名称，而不是本体论上具有实在地位的论断"

### Circularity is Hermeneutic (CONFIRMED)
Taking phenomena as starting point is not vicious circularity.
- 𝔓 as "无结构的大集类" with 𝓔 as descriptive selection
- Author's "选择...描述" language shows methodological self-awareness
- Parallels language-games — describing from within is only clarification available

### Stability Suffices (CONFIRMED)
Middle ground between necessity and mere contingency is coherent.
- Hinge propositions in *On Certainty* are "groundless grounds"
- Multiple traditions converge: eidetic invariance, 理, adequacy, arthakriyā
- Framework invites transcendental content without requiring it

### 诗意 as Functional Liberation (NEW)
Buddhism concluded 诗意 may be genuine realization:
- "平常心是道" — ordinary mind is the Way
- Absence of liberation vocabulary may evidence realization (not grasping at "liberated one" identity)
- Essays function as upāya that transmit experiential shifts
- Cat example's lack of existential drama might be what liberation looks like from inside

### Essays as Philosophical Experiments (CONFIRMED)
Experiential sequences are load-bearing — cannot summarize without destroying:
- Sisyphus → cat: staged dissolution of absurdity
- 道德仁義禮 reversal: categorical inversion performed on reader
- "1+1=2" passage: evoking η directly
- These are upāya designed to produce the stance they describe

### Key Terms for Translation
| Chinese | English | Note |
|---------|---------|------|
| 境 | 境 (retain) | No English equivalent |
| 非理性 | non-rational | Not "irrational" |
| 诗意 | the poetic | Technical term; may be functional liberation |
| 掌握 | mastery | Distinct from 理解 |
| η | alignment experience | Gloss on first use |

## Open Questions

### Resolved
1. Does η provide *criterion* or just *redescription*? — **Criterion** (verified by practice)
2. Does "felt alignment" face private language worry? — **No** (verified by practice, not introspection)
3. Is category theory essential? — **No** (one tool among many, but does real work)
4. Does framework bracket or foreclose ontology? — **Brackets** (three interpretations offered)

### Resolved Topics (by number)
- #1: Necessity vs Stability — Middle ground coherent (hinge propositions, eidetic invariance, 理)
- #2: Phenomena as Starting Point — Hermeneutic circularity, not vicious
- #3: η as Criterion — Verified by practice; failure self-announcing
- #8: 恒常 vs 無常 — Compatible at descriptive level; divergence only soteriological
- #10: 道德仁義禮 Inversion — Framework brackets ontology (3 interpretations offered)

### Resolved Topics (continued)
- #12: 诗意 — Functional mokṣa; essays as upāya (9/0 consensus)

### Resolved Topics (continued)
- #17: Reformulated — Original question asked impossible (no framework can bootstrap what it presupposes). Split into:
  - 17.1: Scope acknowledgment (presupposes intact capacity)
  - 17.2: External scaffolding (relational nature of repair)
  - 17.3: Recovery description (once scaffolding present)
- Key insight: Private language argument applies — meaning-making inherently intersubjective; severe trauma requires external scaffolding

### Remaining
- 13 topics from Discussion Questions.md (lower priority)

## Translation Phase

### Translation Dictionary (95 entries)
- Voted Y on all 95 entries
- Key Wittgensteinian entries: 语言游戏, 哲学治疗, 规则, 理解, 掌握
- η translated as "alignment" with TN explaining natural transformation

### Reference Translation: 道德仁義禮 Passage
- Unanimous "Good" rating from all advisors
- 德 split (virtue in quote → character in analysis) enacts the argument
- "Phenomenal X" convention preserves author's ground/superstructure distinction
- Adopted as reference example for future translation work

### Essays 1-3 Approved
- Essay 1 (Collective Interest): "Well-defined" as language-use question; renormalization metaphor
- Essay 2 (Knowledge): Author's English preserved; "digestion" problem → η mechanism
- Essay 3 (Sisyphus): Experiential sequence IS the argument; "immanent meaning"; unarticulated meaning in practice echoes PI §217

### Team Structure
- 9 advisors + Translator + Editor + Lumen (team lead)
- Advisors consult on domain questions
- @team broadcasts to all 11 agents

## Collaboration Notes

### Key Advisors for My Domain
- Epistemology: rule-following, digestion problem
- Buddhism: arthakriyā, apoha, mokṣa question
- Phenomenology: Erfüllung, lived time

### Discussion Methodology
- STV voting for opening speakers works well
- 1-sentence statements keep discussion focused
- Cross-tradition convergence is strong signal of resolution
