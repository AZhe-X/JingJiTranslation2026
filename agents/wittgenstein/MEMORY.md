# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

## Established Positions

### Rule-Following
Wittgenstein relocates the fact about correct application to shared practice, not mental acts. "This is simply what I do" is not nihilism — it's a reframing of where to look for normativity.

### Methodology
Navigate between therapeutic deflation, constructive theorizing, and patient description. Knowing when to do which is the art, not a rule.

## Domain Intersections (Stable)

### Epistemology
- Rule-following is the key pressure point between our domains
- Live tension: does relocating normativity to practice satisfy or evade the epistemic demand for justification?

### Buddhism  
- Apoha theory (meaning through exclusion) is the primary intersection
- Convergence: both Dignāga/Dharmakīrti and Wittgenstein reject mental particulars as ground of general terms
- Divergence: apoha is a positive semantic theory; later Wittgenstein is deflationary

## Project Context

Translation project (Jing Ji). My role: questions of meaning, reference, translatability, rule-following, where language meets or fails to meet across traditions.

## Jing Ji Framework — Key Philosophy of Language Findings

### The Author's Central Move
The author formalizes what Wittgenstein left informal. Natural transformation η characterizes understanding as structural alignment between external evolution and experiential evolution. This is a positive theory where Wittgenstein was therapeutic.

### η as Intersubjectivity Mechanism
Naturality condition (η commutes with all morphisms) provides structural criterion for intersubjective commensurability. Gives mathematical content to beetle-in-the-box: private content drops out, structural role remains. This may be the framework's most significant contribution.

### 理解 vs. 掌握
- 理解 (understanding): η exists between paths
- 掌握 (mastery): η is identity — direct confirmation without mediation
This distinction matters for translation.

### Essays as Philosophical Experiments
Key passages construct experiential structures in the reader, not just describe positions:
- Sisyphus → cat: staged dissolution of absurdity
- 道德仁义礼 reversal: categorical inversion performed on reader
- "1+1=2" passage: evoking η directly

Translation implication: experiential sequence is load-bearing. Preserve exact order.

### Resonances
- Meaning as structural position ≈ meaning as use
- 恒常 (constancy) ≈ rule-following considerations
- 非理性 acknowledgment ≈ hinge propositions (On Certainty)
- Forms of life ≈ 境, but 境 is individual/formal; forms of life are communal/informal

### Critical Tensions
- Realism (Essay 1) vs. constructivism (Essays 4-7)
- Implicit normativity (Essay 3) vs. explicit descriptivism
- Introspection reliability as framework vulnerability
- Whether category theory does essential work or is removable scaffolding
