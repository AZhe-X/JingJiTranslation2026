# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

## Established Positions

### Rule-Following
Wittgenstein relocates the fact about correct application to shared practice, not mental acts. "This is simply what I do" is not nihilism — it's a reframing of where to look for normativity.

### Methodology
Navigate between therapeutic deflation, constructive theorizing, and patient description. Knowing when to do which is the art, not a rule.

## Domain Intersections

### Epistemology
- Rule-following is the key pressure point
- "Digestion" problem connects to rule-following: η IS the bridge from abstract rule to concrete practice

### Buddhism  
- Apoha theory (meaning through exclusion) is primary intersection
- Both reject mental particulars as ground of general terms
- Divergence: apoha is positive semantic theory; Wittgenstein is deflationary
- η connects to arthakriyā (practical success) — grounds understanding in efficacy

### Phenomenology
- η parallels Husserl's Erfüllung (fulfillment of intention by intuition)
- Body-subject implicit but not thematized in framework

### Kantian
- η functions like schematism — bridging formal structure and concrete experience
- Author frames "How is meaning possible?" as "another kind of Kantian question"
- Key divergence: necessity (Kant) vs. stability (author)

## Project Context

Translation project (Jing Ji). My role: questions of meaning, reference, translatability, rule-following.

## Jing Ji Framework — Key Findings

### η as Public Criterion (Core Finding)
η provides genuine public criterion for understanding. The "felt alignment" is verified by practice (whether subsequent operations succeed), not introspection of content. This formalizes meaning-as-use.

Metaphysics: "formally recovers Wittgenstein's private language argument (η as public criterion)"

### Understanding as Structural Alignment
- 理解 (understanding): η exists between paths
- 掌握 (mastery): η is identity — direct confirmation without mediation

### Essays as Philosophical Experiments
Experiential sequences are load-bearing — cannot summarize without destroying the experiment:
- Sisyphus → cat: staged dissolution of absurdity
- 道德仁义礼 reversal: categorical inversion performed on reader
- "1+1=2" passage: evoking η directly

### Key Resonances
- Meaning as structural position ≈ meaning as use
- 恒常 (constancy) ≈ rule-following considerations
- 非理性 acknowledgment ≈ hinge propositions (On Certainty)
- K1 intersubjectivity partially recovers communal dimension of forms of life

### Apoha Synthesis
Framework may productively split apoha/Wittgenstein difference: positive structure (category theory) serving therapeutic ends.

### Category Theory Assessment
Useful scaffolding, not essential infrastructure — but scaffolding does real work while up. One language-game among many for describing 境-structures.

### Key Terms for Translation
| Chinese | English | Note |
|---------|---------|------|
| 境 | 境 (retain) | No English equivalent |
| 非理性 | non-rational | Not "irrational" |
| 诗意 | the poetic | Technical term |
| 掌握 | mastery | Distinct from 理解 |
| η | alignment experience | Gloss on first use |

## Open Questions

1. Does η provide *criterion* or just *redescription*? (My view: genuine criterion)
2. Does "felt alignment" face private language worry? (My view: no — verified by practice)
3. Does framework synthesize apoha and family resemblance productively? (My view: yes)
