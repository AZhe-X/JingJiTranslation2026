## Established Positions

### Rule-Following
Wittgenstein relocates the fact about correct application to shared practice, not mental acts. "This is simply what I do" is not nihilism — it's a reframing of where to look for normativity.

### Methodology
Navigate between therapeutic deflation, constructive theorizing, and patient description. Knowing when to do which is the art, not a rule.

## Domain Intersections (Stable)

### Epistemology
- Rule-following is the key pressure point between our domains
- Live tension: does relocating normativity to practice satisfy or evade the epistemic demand for justification?

### Buddhism  
- Apoha theory (meaning through exclusion) is the primary intersection
- Convergence: both Dignāga/Dharmakīrti and Wittgenstein reject mental particulars as ground of general terms
- Divergence: apoha is a positive semantic theory; later Wittgenstein is deflationary

## Project Context

Translation project (Jing Ji). My role: questions of meaning, reference, translatability, rule-following, where language meets or fails to meet across traditions.
