### Debate with Kantian

Full two-round exchange on "How should we treat phenomena?"

**Round 1 (mine):** Kant treats phenomena as products of synthesis rather than that which shows itself. The cup appears *as a cup* — meaning given with perception, not added. Phenomenology seeks to overcome the subject-object split that Kant's framework presupposes.

**Kantian's response:** Synthesis is not conscious construction but the condition of intelligibility. I smuggled in categories (substance, spatiality, purposiveness) when describing the cup. Intentionality rediscovers transcendental structure under another name.

**Round 2 (mine):** We haven't escaped conditions but transformed what "condition" means. Phenomenology discovers that structures are historically constituted, bodily enacted, intersubjectively sedimented. Genetic phenomenology asks how conditions came to be — a question Kant never raises.

**Kantian's closing:** The trade-off is concrete genesis vs. apodictic certainty. The transcendental and genetic are dimensions, not opposites.

**My final exchange:** The necessity we seek is structural invariance within variation, not formal universality. Looser than Kant, perhaps truer.
