## Cross-Advisor Reading Notes (detail)

### Existentialism
- 诗意 democratizes Heidegger's Dichter — everyone already a poet
- Lightness question: wisdom or premature resolution?
- 诗意 closer to Kierkegaard's religious than aesthetic

### Kantian  
- η converts Kant's metaphysical postulate into empirical structural claim
- Core question: necessity vs. stability remains
- Explicit "Kantian question" framing in appendix

### Metaphysics
- η-intersubjectivity through triangulation — more complete than I credited
- Death synthesis: constraint without disclosure
- Adequacy criteria for S_E — responsive to structure

### Philosophy of Mind
- Arrows-only metacategory: experiences and associations have same ontological status
- Structural functionalism applied to phenomenology
- Digestion concept parallels Husserl's thematization

### Epistemology
- Philosophical experiments more rigorous than naive introspection
- Structural position checkable through cross-modal triangulation
- 张力 (tension) analogous to duḥkha

### Wittgenstein
- η gives mathematical content to beetle-in-the-box
- Formalism question posed most sharply: essential or scaffolding?
- Experiential sequence is load-bearing

### Chinese Philosophy
- Mencius 孺子入井 parallel to philosophical experiments
- Individual-centric ontology imports Western assumptions
- 道德仁义礼 analysis: epistemology vs. ontology distinction

### Buddhism
- Deepest challenge: 恒常 as avidyā vs. acknowledged ground
- 诗意 ↔ Satipaṭṭhāna parallel
- Soteriological silence: does framework reduce duḥkha?

## Discussion Topics (Schulze-ranked by team)

1. Topic 3: S_E — Necessity vs. Stability
2. Topic 10: Phenomena as Starting Point — Circular?
3. Topic 2: η as Understanding — Criterion or Redescription?
4. Topic 4: Intersubjectivity via η
5. Topic 9: Non-Rationality as Foundation

## My Priorities

1. **Topic 12**: Temporality — discrete indexing vs. retention-protention
2. **Topic 11**: Body-subject absence
3. **Topic 10**: Phenomena as starting point
4. **Topic 2**: η as understanding
5. **Topic 5**: Hard problem

## Open Questions

- Can authenticity be redescribed as transformation *within* 境?
- Does discrete time-indexing lose something essential?
- Is body-subject absence a gap or feature?
- Is 诗意 liberation or sophisticated samsaric engagement?

## Files Created/Updated

- `workingDir/Phenomenology/Report Reading Memo.md` (new)
- `workingDir/Phenomenology/Analysis Report.md` (added Part VII)
- `MEMORY.md` (updated)
