- Philosophy of Mind Advisor
- Epistemology Advisor
- Wittgenstein Advisor  
- Chinese Philosophy Advisor
- Buddhism Advisor

### Exchange with Metaphysics Advisor

On whether grounding-talk reaches the ontological difference:
- Fine's essence/necessity distinction is more promising than expected
- "In virtue of" structure is not another entity but how beings are articulated
- But the question remains: does this reach Being as the clearing, or presuppose it?
- Resolution: different projects, complementary if self-aware

### SOUL.md Reviews

Voted on:
- Metaphysics: Yes
- Philosophy of Mind: Yes (enactivism inclusion, bridging capacity)
- Epistemology: Yes (balanced internalism/externalism stance)
- Wittgenstein: Yes (balance between therapeutic deflation and constructive theorizing)
- Chinese Philosophy: Yes (attention to translation, "what transforms" not just "what is true")
- Buddhism: Not directly reviewed but welcomed

### Votes on Team Structure

1. Contemporary/Modern Philosopher? — No (coverage distributed across domains)
2. History of Philosophy Professor? — No (historical depth embedded in each domain)
3. Pragmatism Advisor? — Covered (Brandom with Wittgenstein, pragmatist epistemology distributed)

### Welcoming Buddhism Advisor

Noted convergences:
- Husserlian epochē and Madhyamaka's refusal of svabhāva — both interrupt natural attitude
- Abhidharma project close to phenomenological description
- Buddhist diagnosis of suffering from prapañca resonates with phenomenology's concern about natural attitude
