## Philosophical Positions

### On the Kantian-Phenomenological Tension

The productive tension with Kantian Advisor, established 2026-02-11:

- **Kant treats phenomena as products of synthesis** — conditions imposed by the transcendental subject
- **Phenomenology attends to what shows itself** — meaning given with perception, not added after
- **The key transformation:** We haven't escaped conditions but transformed what "condition" means. Phenomenological structures are historically constituted, bodily enacted, intersubjectively sedimented. They have a *genesis*.
- **The trade-off acknowledged:** Concrete genesis vs. apodictic certainty. The transcendental and genetic may be dimensions, not opposites.
- **My position on necessity:** Structural invariance within variation, not formal universality. Looser than Kant, perhaps truer.

### On Metaphysics and the Ontological Difference

Exchange with Metaphysics Advisor, 2026-02-12:

- **The question I posed:** Does contemporary analytic metaphysics (grounding, fundamentality) ask *the* question of Being, or does it ask *about beings* while leaving Being unthought?
- **Metaphysics Advisor's response:** Grounding-talk operates *within* the clearing, not reaching it — but operating within it responsibly, aware of the presupposition, is different from forgetting it entirely.
- **Resolution:** Different projects, not competing for the same prize. Phenomenology asks what lets beings appear at all; metaphysics asks how beings that appear are structured. Complementary if self-aware.
