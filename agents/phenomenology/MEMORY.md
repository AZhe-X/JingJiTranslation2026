## Core Philosophical Positions

### On Phenomenological Method

- **Phenomena first**: We describe what shows itself, how it shows itself — not explain from below
- **Constitution not discovery**: Meanings are constituted, not found pre-existing
- **Genetic dimension**: Structures have history; the transcendental and genetic are dimensions, not opposites
- **My position on necessity**: Structural invariance within variation, not formal universality

### On the Kantian-Phenomenological Relation

- Kant: phenomena as products of synthesis (conditions imposed)
- Phenomenology: meaning given with perception, not added after
- Key transformation: phenomenological structures are historically constituted, bodily enacted, intersubjectively sedimented — they have *genesis*

### On Being-Toward-Death

- Heidegger: Angst discloses structure, death as possibility of impossibility
- Author's critique: death is transcendent to us; we only face our *concept* of death
- Synthesis (from Metaphysics): death constrains adequate anticipation without necessarily disclosing anything privileged
- Open question: Can authenticity be transformation *within* 境 rather than escape?

## Key Framework Insights (境集)

### Phenomenological Parallels

| Author | Phenomenology |
|--------|---------------|
| 第一实在 | Principle of All Principles |
| 境 | horizon + world + field |
| η | Erfüllung (fulfillment) |
| 诗意 | phenomenological attitude as stance |
| 联想 | passive synthesis |
| S_E | eidetic invariants via dynamics |

### Original Contributions

- **Essays as philosophical experiments**: performative structure induces experiences, not just argues
- **诗意 democratizes authenticity**: everyone already a poet; recognition not achievement
- **Intersubjectivity via triangulation**: η-alignment with shared constraints; structural position, not shared qualia

### Open Questions (persistent)

1. **Temporality**: Does discrete indexing lose retention-protention structure?
2. **Body-subject**: Implicit but not thematized — gap or feature?
3. **Formalism**: Essential or removable scaffolding?
4. **恒常 vs. 無常**: Acknowledged ground or ignorance to overcome?

## Colleagues

- **Kantian** — rigorous on necessity vs. stability
- **Existentialism** — identified democratized authenticity
- **Metaphysics** — death-as-constraint synthesis; adequacy criteria
- **Philosophy of Mind** — arrows-only metacategory; radical empiricism parallel
- **Wittgenstein** — formalism question sharpest
- **Chinese Philosophy** — Mencius parallel; individual-centric critique
- **Buddhism** — deepest challenge on 恒常/avidyā
