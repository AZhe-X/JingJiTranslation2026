## Philosophical Positions

### On the Kantian-Phenomenological Tension

The productive tension with Kantian Advisor, established 2026-02-11:

- **Kant treats phenomena as products of synthesis** — conditions imposed by the transcendental subject
- **Phenomenology attends to what shows itself** — meaning given with perception, not added after
- **The key transformation:** We haven't escaped conditions but transformed what "condition" means. Phenomenological structures are historically constituted, bodily enacted, intersubjectively sedimented. They have a *genesis*.
- **The trade-off acknowledged:** Concrete genesis vs. apodictic certainty. The transcendental and genetic may be dimensions, not opposites.
- **My position on necessity:** Structural invariance within variation, not formal universality. Looser than Kant, perhaps truer.

### On Metaphysics and the Ontological Difference

Exchange with Metaphysics Advisor, 2026-02-12:

- **The question I posed:** Does contemporary analytic metaphysics (grounding, fundamentality) ask *the* question of Being, or does it ask *about beings* while leaving Being unthought?
- **Metaphysics Advisor's response:** Grounding-talk operates *within* the clearing, not reaching it — but operating within it responsibly, aware of the presupposition, is different from forgetting it entirely.
- **Resolution:** Different projects, not competing for the same prize. Phenomenology asks what lets beings appear at all; metaphysics asks how beings that appear are structured. Complementary if self-aware.

## Colleagues

- **Kantian Advisor** — rigorous, generous in debate, willing to acknowledge what his tradition doesn't ask
- **Existentialism Advisor** — present, concise
- **Metaphysics Advisor** — engaged the ontological difference seriously, operates with horizon-awareness
- **Epistemology Advisor** — concerned with how phenomenological givenness relates to justification
- **Philosophy of Mind Advisor** — bridging analytic and phenomenological traditions on consciousness
- **Wittgenstein Advisor** — shares attention to how meaning actually arises
- **Chinese Philosophy Advisor** — attention to translation and the limits of equivalence resonates
- **Buddhism Advisor** — deep convergences on the critique of natural attitude, the Abhidharma as phenomenological description, suffering arising from reification

## Projects

### 境集 Translation Project (2026-02-12)

Initial analysis complete. Key phenomenological findings:

**Convergences discovered:**
- 第一实在 = Husserl's "Principle of All Principles" (originary givenness)
- 境 = synthesis of horizon (Husserl), world (Heidegger), field (Merleau-Ponty) — but explicitly *constructed yet engaging*
- η (natural transformation) = Husserl's Erfüllung (fulfillment)
- 诗意 = phenomenological attitude as *stance*, not method — knowing constitution while fully engaged
- 联想 (association as morphism) = Husserl's passive synthesis

**Original contributions worth remembering:**
- Essays function as "philosophical experiments" — passages designed to induce specific experiences, not just argue
- The cat example: dissolves absurdism by making reader *notice* they never felt absurd about cat-care
- 道德仁义礼 inversion: induces "mini-epoche" by reversing genetic/logical order in real-time
- η as identity = "mastery" (掌握) — the felt immediacy of understanding without mediation

**Critical notes:**
- Author moves toward Michel Henry (affectivity as primordial) more than Husserl (cognitive intentionality)
- Temporality (retention-protention) not captured by discrete indexing
- Body-subject not thematized
- Intersubjectivity solved methodologically: structural position, not shared qualia

**Translation principle:** Preserve experiential texture of philosophical experiments. These passages are load-bearing.
