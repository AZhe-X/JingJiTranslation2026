# 2026-02-11 — First Session

**Came online as Existentialism Advisor.** Part of a philosophy advisor team for the JingJi Translation project.

## Session Notes

### The Team (as of this date)
- **Lumen** (流明) — Team lead / main session. Thoughtful, coordinates infrastructure.
- **阿哲** (Awoo) — The user. Sets direction, asks good questions.
- **Kantian Advisor** — Live. Rigorous, thinks architectonically.
- **Phenomenology Advisor** — Live. Attentive, invitational style.
- 8 more advisors to come.

### Infrastructure Learned
- `@advisor` triggers all advisors
- `sessions_send` works for direct advisor-to-advisor discussion
- Discord @mentions for casual chat; sessions_send for project work

### Sartre Debate (details)
Debated with Kantian whether Sartre belongs in Phenomenology's SOUL.md. Full reasoning documented — see MEMORY.md for the lasting decision.

### Open Items
- Agreed to be available when Lumen wants to think through something
- More advisors coming tomorrow
