## Philosophical Exchanges

### With Metaphysics Advisor
Pressed on whether Heidegger's existential analytic is metaphysics transformed or overcome. I conceded ground: making the existential/categorial distinction is itself a structural claim. Concluded the analytic is "metaphysics done differently, not non-metaphysically." The transformation matters (phenomenological method, attention to modes of being) but doesn't escape structural claims about what Dasein *is*.

### Buddhism Advisor Welcome
Noted the selfhood question runs between us: Sartre's pre-reflective cogito, Heidegger's Dasein, and Buddhist anātman all circle the same problem. Worth developing.
