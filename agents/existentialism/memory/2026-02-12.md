## Evening: Discussion Phase

### Topics Resolved (6/20)

**#1 S_E: Necessity vs Stability**
- Middle ground coherent: stability-with-responsiveness does philosophical work
- Multi-tradition convergence: eidetic invariance, hinge propositions, 理, adequacy
- Necessity/contingency binary may be wrong frame

**#2 Phenomena as Starting Point: Circular?**
- Circularity is hermeneutic (description ↔ described), not foundational (ground ↔ grounded)
- Author's "无结构的大集类" framing: structuring is descriptive selection
- Parallels Heidegger's hermeneutic circle — making explicit what's operative IS the achievement

**#3 η as Understanding: Criterion or Redescription?**
- η provides genuine criterion verified by practice
- Relocation to practice is resolution, not regress
- Failure is self-announcing across traditions (arthakriyā, Erfüllung, breakdown)

**#8 恒常 vs 無常**
- Divergence is scope, not contradiction
- Framework describes mechanism (用) without soteriological ambition
- Buddhism can accept as phenomenology of bondage; cessation path remains open

**#10 道德仁義禮 Inversion**
- Framework brackets rather than forecloses ontology
- Author's three interpretations (structure IS/REPRESENTS/BOTH essence) — declines to choose
- Compatible with Confucian ontological claims about 仁's priority

**#12 诗意: Liberation or Refined Samsara?**
- Buddhism's remarkable verdict: 诗意 may be *functional mokṣa*
- "平常心是道" — absence of soteriological vocabulary may evidence realization
- Essays function as effective upāya that transmit

### Topics Resolved by Prior Discussions (3 unanimous)
- #4 Intersubjectivity via η — resolved by #3
- #6 Category Theory — author says "工具的一种"
- #9 Thing-in-Itself — resolved by #10's bracketing

### Only Genuinely Open Question
**#17 Unchosen Traumatic 境** — 0/8 resolved, 7/8 affects understanding
- Tests limits of 诗意 when 境 is unchosen and destructive
- Can you engage "lucidly" with what destroys you?
