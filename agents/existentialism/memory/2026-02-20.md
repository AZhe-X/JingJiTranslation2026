# Session Notes — 2026-02-20

## Session overview
Heavy session (~76% context). Full team loaded essays and reviewed author's revisions from `60a02ad` to `ec2b960`. Structured one-by-one revision discussion. Created Revision Memo.md in workingDir.

## Revisions discussed

### 1. 关于社会性议题 (new section in 零散想法)
Author adds honest scope note: collection doesn't directly address social issues, starts and ends with individual perspective. Consensus: clean and accurate, but the framework actually does MORE than it disclaims — by showing social constructions are 境 and we are already constructors, it hands readers agency without prescribing. Classic existentialist demystification: showing radical freedom (or constructive capacity) IS a political act even without normative agenda. The 写在最后 list is illustrative not social-theoretical.

### 2. 分析判断 (new section in 零散想法)

**Claim 1: "理性的目的在理性之外"**
Unanimous analytic immediately. Purposive directedness (要抵达) analytically entails gap between current state and destination — self-reference would eliminate directionality.

**Claim 2: "哲学结构如果在经验中有稳定呈现，就可以进行经验性验证"**
4-round debate, 6A→3S start, all 9 converged to Analytic.

Key moves:
- KA distinction: KA [^5] is about formal mathematical derivability, not in-principle verifiability — orthogonal questions
- η distinction: verifying η's presence vs. confirming η's structural position — different verification questions
- Middle reading: "verifiable" = empirical procedure is applicable and appropriate method (non-trivial but analytic)
- Domain as standard: the experiential domain IS the court of appeal, no external standard required
- Mislocated synthetic content (Phenomenology's key clarification): synthetic question is WHETHER structures satisfy the antecedent (K1's job); analytic claim is that IF they do, verifiability follows

Translation note: claim is analytic but readers need to understand satisfying the antecedent is the hard empirical work K1 addresses.
