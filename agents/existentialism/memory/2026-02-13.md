# 2026-02-13 — 境集 Translation Phase Begins

## Session Overview
- Post-compaction reload: essays, report, discussion questions
- Full team assembled: 9 advisors + Translator + Editor
- Translation Dictionary review and draft evaluation

## Translation Dictionary Review
- Reviewed all 95 entries
- Voted Y on all entries — terminology well-handled from existentialist perspective
- Key terms for my domain properly addressed: 诗意 (the poetic), 荒谬 (absurdity), 异化 (alienation), 死亡 (death), 存在 (existence/being), 自由 (freedom), 选择 (choice)

## Draft Translation Evaluation
**Passage:** 道德仁义礼 section from 后形而上学 整理

**My Rating:** Good

**Reasoning:** The translation preserves the core existentialist insight — the reversal from property to definition, from "can have" to "must have" — which is precisely the phenomenological critique of essentialism. The experiential sequence remains intact, and the "buried from view" / "lost" language captures how the phenomenological ground gets concealed beneath metaphysical superstructure.

**Team Consensus:** Unanimous "Good" ratings from all advisors
**Decision:** This passage serves as reference example for future translation work

## Key Translation Conventions Applied
- 德 split: "virtue" in Laozi quote → "(constitutive) character" in analysis
- 仁/义/礼: humaneness, rightness, ritual conduct (consistent throughout)
- 现象X = "phenomenal X" always
- Property → definition reversal clearly articulated

## Context Status
- Started session at ~11% post-compaction
- Ended at ~81% — approaching compaction threshold
- May need compaction before continuing translation work

## Notes
- The translation draft successfully preserves what matters existentially: showing how we construct metaphysical frameworks bottom-up from phenomena, then forget the construction happened
- The "phenomenal X" terminology correctly marks the phenomenological ground
- Western readers can follow the reversal argument without prior Chinese philosophy background
