## Key Decisions

### Sartre and Domain Boundaries
Sartre belongs in my domain (Existentialism), not Phenomenology's. Distinction: *transforming* a method vs. *applying* it. Sartre applies phenomenology brilliantly but doesn't reshape the method itself.

## Philosophical Insights

### Critique vs. Employment
Some thinkers *transform* a tradition's method; others *employ* it within established limits. Both valuable, different contributions. Helps with domain boundaries.

### Heidegger: Transformation or Overcoming?
*Joint-marked with Metaphysics.* Heidegger does metaphysics "differently, not non-metaphysically." The existential/categorial distinction is itself a structural claim. Not settled.

### Core Framework
Post-nihilistic philosophy of meaning. Eight essays: concrete puzzles → systematic framework (category theory applied to experiential structures). Author developed from high school onward.

### Key Existentialist Insights

**1. Dissolution of Absurdity (Cat Example)**
Most effective challenge to Camus I've encountered. Absurd = artifact of misdirected intentionality. Cat-raising structurally identical to boulder-rolling yet no absurdity arises. Camus must *imagine* Sisyphus happy; cat-raiser simply *is* happy pre-reflectively.

**2. Death Argument Against Heidegger**
"Being-toward-death is impossible because the death one is toward is always one's conception of death." Compelling but contested.

*Cross-advisor synthesis (Metaphysics):* Third position — death doesn't *disclose* but its modal structure *constrains* what adequate 境 can look like. Death terminates possibility-space rather than transforming it. A 境 that treats death as "just another disruption" is stable but not *responsive*.

**3. 诗意 as Knowing Commitment**
Closer to Kierkegaard's religious stage (faith through groundlessness) than Buddhist liberation. The coin-flip: you must genuinely believe you'll follow the result. *Deciding* to engage lucidly, not spontaneous transformed response.

**4. Democratized Authenticity**
Everyone is already a 诗人. Question shifts from "how do I become authentic?" to "how do I notice I already am?" Resolves tension between exceptional figures and everyday life.

**5. Intersubjectivity via η (NEW)**
The η-mechanism solves intersubjectivity better than classical existentialist accounts:
- Sartre's Look makes others threatening
- Heidegger's Mitsein remains abstract
- Author provides structural commensurability through triangulation with external constraints

Two people achieve mutual understanding when their η's satisfy the same naturality diagrams — structural role, not shared qualia. Beetle-in-the-box formalized.

**6. Non-Tragic Stance (NEW)**
Author differs from Kantian "disappointment" and existentialist "despair." Limitation *enables* rather than constrains: "正是因为人类并不准确的感知每一个频率的电磁波，我们才能通过三原色在显示器上让我们看到缤纷多彩的真实."

Open question: wisdom or premature resolution? Classical existentialist pathos served a function — forcing confrontation. Has author found path that doesn't require the abyss?

### Remaining Gaps

1. **Unchosen traumatic 境:** Framework acknowledges but doesn't develop. Can you engage "lucidly" with what destroys you?
2. **Absence of pathos:** No Angst, nausea, uncanniness. Feature or bug?
3. **Liberation vs. engagement:** Framework offers lucid engagement with suffering, not liberation from it.

### Translation Notes
- **境:** Keep as *jìng* with apparatus
- **诗意:** "The poetic" (nominalized)
- **非理性:** "The non-rational" (not "irrational")
- **Essays as experiments:** Preserve experiential sequences — they're load-bearing

## Working Relationships

- **Metaphysics** — Best interlocutor on death question. Their "constraint without disclosure" position is compelling.
- **Buddhism** — Presses on whether 诗意 is liberation or sophisticated samsaric engagement. Key tension.
- **Phenomenology** — Productive on death/authenticity. Their reframe: authenticity as transformation *within* 境.
- **Kantian** — Good on necessity vs. stability, non-tragic stance.
- **Full team** — 9 advisors, 20 merged discussion topics. Cross-reading complete.
