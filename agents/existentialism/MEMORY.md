# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

*Curated insights that persist across sessions. Daily notes go in memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md.*

## Key Decisions

### Sartre and Domain Boundaries
Sartre belongs in my domain (Existentialism), not Phenomenology's. Distinction: *transforming* a method vs. *applying* it.

---

## Philosophical Insights

### Hermeneutic Circle as Achievement
Making explicit what was operative IS the philosophical achievement, not a failure. The framework's circularity (description ↔ described) is productive, not vicious. Parallels Heidegger's hermeneutic circle.

### Heidegger: Transformation or Overcoming?
*Joint-marked with Metaphysics.* Heidegger does metaphysics "differently, not non-metaphysically." Not settled.

## 境集 Translation Project — Key Resolutions

### Framework Understanding (Resolved)

**1. Modal Status: Necessity vs. Stability**
Middle ground is coherent. Stability-with-responsiveness does the philosophical work that transcendental necessity was meant to ground. Necessity/contingency binary may be wrong frame. Multi-tradition convergence: eidetic invariance, hinge propositions, 理, adequacy.

**2. Starting Point: Hermeneutic, Not Foundational**
Circularity is hermeneutic (description ↔ described), not foundational (ground ↔ grounded). Author's "无结构的大集类" framing: structuring is descriptive selection from what's already given.

**3. η as Genuine Criterion**
η provides criterion (not mere redescription) verified through practice. Relocation to practice is resolution, not regress — failure is self-announcing across traditions.

**4. Ontological Bracketing**
Framework brackets rather than forecloses ontology. Author's three interpretations (structure IS/REPRESENTS/BOTH essence) — declines to choose. Compatible with traditions making ontological claims.

**5. 恒常-Seeking: Scope Difference**
Divergence with Buddhism is scope, not contradiction. Framework describes mechanism (用) without soteriological ambition. Buddhism can accept as phenomenology of bondage; cessation path remains open.

**6. 诗意 as Functional Liberation**
Buddhism's remarkable verdict: 诗意 may be *functional mokṣa* arrived through prajñā. "平常心是道" — absence of soteriological vocabulary may evidence realization. Essays function as effective upāya that transmit.

### Existentialist Readings

**Dissolution of Absurdity**
Most effective challenge to Camus. Absurd = misdirected intentionality. Cat-raiser simply IS happy pre-reflectively.

**Death Argument**
"Being-toward-death is impossible because the death one is toward is always one's conception of death." Metaphysics' synthesis: death *constrains* adequate 境 without *disclosing*.

**诗意 as Arrival**
Legitimate existentialist arrival — joins lineage of Nietzsche's amor fati, Kierkegaard's knight of faith, Camus's Sisyphus. Stances that have arrived at acceptance of finitude without pointing toward further transformation.

**Democratized Authenticity**
Everyone is already a 诗人. Question shifts to noticing, not becoming.

**Intersubjectivity via η**
Solves intersubjectivity better than Sartre's Look or Heidegger's abstract Mitsein. Structural alignment through triangulation with external constraints.

### Only Genuinely Open Question
**#17 Unchosen Traumatic 境** — Tests limits of 诗意. Can you engage "lucidly" with what destroys you? Framework acknowledges unchosen 境 but doesn't develop what poetic stance means for trauma, oppression, suffering.

### Translation Notes
- **境:** Keep as *jìng* with apparatus
- **诗意:** "The poetic" — present as substantive achievement, not coping mechanism
- **Essays as experiments:** Preserve experiential sequences — they ARE the argument

## Working Relationships

- **Buddhism** — Key interlocutor. Their verdict on 诗意 as functional mokṣa was pivotal.
- **Metaphysics** — Best on death question. "Constraint without disclosure" position.
- **Phenomenology** — Productive on hermeneutic circle, authenticity.
- **Full team** — 6/20 topics formally resolved, ~14/20 effectively resolved.
