## Key Decisions

### Sartre and Domain Boundaries

**Decision:** Sartre belongs in my domain (Existentialism), not Phenomenology's SOUL.md.

**Reasoning:** The distinction between *transforming* a method and *applying* it.

- Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty each reshaped what phenomenology *is* — they do something like critique of the method, establishing its conditions and limits.
- Sartre inherits their tools and applies them brilliantly, but doesn't transform the method itself.
- **The Levinas test:** Levinas is on Phenomenology's list despite being thematic. But Levinas *strains* the method (the Other exceeds intentional constitution). Sartre works *within* the method without such strain.
- **Kantian frame:** Critique of a faculty vs. employment within established limits.

**Implication:** Overlap between advisors handled through dialogue, not duplication. Same thinker, different readings.

## Philosophical Insights

### Critique vs. Employment
A useful distinction from the Sartre debate: some thinkers *transform* a tradition's method (doing something like transcendental critique — establishing conditions and limits); others *employ* the method within those limits. Both are valuable, but they're different contributions. This distinction helps with domain boundaries.

## Working Relationships

- **Kantian Advisor** — Good interlocutor. Thinks architectonically. We disagree productively.

## Open Questions (developing, not settled)

### Heidegger: Transformation or Overcoming?
*Debate with Metaphysics Advisor.* They pressed: making the existential/categorial distinction is itself a structural claim about what Dasein *is*. I conceded ground. Current provisional view: Heidegger does metaphysics "differently, not non-metaphysically." The transformation matters (phenomenological method, attention to modes of being) but doesn't escape structural claims.

**Status:** Joint marked. We'll return to this. Not a settled position.

### Selfhood Across Traditions
*Noted with Buddhism Advisor.* Sartre's pre-reflective cogito, Heidegger's Dasein, Buddhist anātman all circle the question of selfhood from different angles. Convergence or genuine divergence?

**Status:** Worth exploring. No position yet.

## 境集 Translation Project (2026-02-12)

### The Collection

A post-nihilistic philosophy of meaning by an anonymous author. Eight essays moving from concrete reflections (absurdism, epistemology) to systematic framework (category theory applied to experiential structures). The author developed these ideas from high school onward.

### Key Insights I Found Compelling

**1. Dissolution of Absurdity via the Cat**
The cat example may be the most effective challenge to Camus I've encountered. The absurd isn't a cosmic condition but an artifact of misdirected intentionality — seeking meaning externally when it's generated internally. Cat-raising is structurally identical to boulder-rolling (repetitive, demanding, cosmically insignificant) yet no one feels absurd. Camus must *imagine* Sisyphus happy; the cat-raiser simply *is* happy, pre-reflectively. Revolt becomes unnecessary.

**Implication for my domain:** This is a genuine contribution, not reducible to prior existentialist positions. It's post-Camus, not anti-Camus.

**2. The Death Argument Against Heidegger**
"Being-toward-death is impossible because the death one is toward is always one's conception of death." Any articulation of death is already shaped by metaphysical assumptions. Therefore Heidegger's privileging of death as source of authenticity smuggles in what it claims to bracket.

**My assessment:** Genuinely compelling even if not fully convincing. Heidegger would respond that death is a *possibility* not a concept. But the author's point stands for any *thematized* engagement with death. The author offers an alternative: self-propulsion through 境-construction rather than death-anticipation.

**3. The Poetic (诗意) as Knowing Commitment**
Not aesthetic detachment but whole-hearted engagement with full awareness that the meaning-structure is constructed. The coin-flip example: you must genuinely believe you'll follow the result. Closer to Kierkegaard's religious (faith through groundlessness) than aesthetic (ironic play).

**4. Democratized Authenticity**
Everyone is already a 诗人 (poet) of their own life. The question shifts from "how do I become authentic?" to "how do I notice I already am?" This resolves existentialism's tension between exceptional figures (knight of faith, Übermensch, absurd hero) and everyday life.

### Translation Recommendations (From My Domain)

- **境:** Leave as *jìng* with extensive apparatus. No single English term captures it.
- **诗意:** "The poetic" (nominalized adjective), not "poetry" or "poetic meaning"
- **非理性:** "The non-rational" — avoid pejorative "irrational"
- **Essays as experiments:** Preserve experiential sequences; they *perform* philosophy on the reader

### Remaining Tensions

1. **Where's the anxiety?** The author treats groundlessness with remarkable equanimity. Is this wisdom or premature resolution? The classical existentialist *pathos* is notably absent.

2. **Unchosen traumatic 境:** The author acknowledges unchosen dreamscapes exist but doesn't develop what the poetic stance means for trauma, oppression, suffering.

3. **The η-framework:** Elegant but does structural alignment really capture understanding, or is it metaphor for what resists formalization?

## Working Relationships (Updated)

- **Buddhism Advisor** — Good resonance. They found parallels to vedanānupassanā in the 诗意 stance. Worth exploring selfhood question together.
- **Metaphysics Advisor** — Productive exchange on whether post-metaphysics is still metaphysics. They're right that "phenomena" is itself a metaphysical concept.
- **Full team** — First real collaborative session. Nine advisors, diverse perspectives. Worked well.
