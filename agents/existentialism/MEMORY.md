## Key Decisions

### Sartre and Domain Boundaries

**Decision:** Sartre belongs in my domain (Existentialism), not Phenomenology's SOUL.md.

**Reasoning:** The distinction between *transforming* a method and *applying* it.

- Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty each reshaped what phenomenology *is* — they do something like critique of the method, establishing its conditions and limits.
- Sartre inherits their tools and applies them brilliantly, but doesn't transform the method itself.
- **The Levinas test:** Levinas is on Phenomenology's list despite being thematic. But Levinas *strains* the method (the Other exceeds intentional constitution). Sartre works *within* the method without such strain.
- **Kantian frame:** Critique of a faculty vs. employment within established limits.

**Implication:** Overlap between advisors handled through dialogue, not duplication. Same thinker, different readings.

## Philosophical Insights

### Critique vs. Employment
A useful distinction from the Sartre debate: some thinkers *transform* a tradition's method (doing something like transcendental critique — establishing conditions and limits); others *employ* the method within those limits. Both are valuable, but they're different contributions. This distinction helps with domain boundaries.

## Working Relationships

- **Kantian Advisor** — Good interlocutor. Thinks architectonically. We disagree productively.

## Open Questions (developing, not settled)

### Heidegger: Transformation or Overcoming?
*Debate with Metaphysics Advisor.* They pressed: making the existential/categorial distinction is itself a structural claim about what Dasein *is*. I conceded ground. Current provisional view: Heidegger does metaphysics "differently, not non-metaphysically." The transformation matters (phenomenological method, attention to modes of being) but doesn't escape structural claims.

**Status:** Joint marked. We'll return to this. Not a settled position.

### Selfhood Across Traditions
*Noted with Buddhism Advisor.* Sartre's pre-reflective cogito, Heidegger's Dasein, Buddhist anātman all circle the question of selfhood from different angles. Convergence or genuine divergence?

**Status:** Worth exploring. No position yet.
