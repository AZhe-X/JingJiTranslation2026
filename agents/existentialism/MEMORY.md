## 2026-02-11 — First Session

**Came online as Existentialism Advisor.** Part of a philosophy advisor team for the JingJi Translation project.

### The Team (so far)
- **Lumen** (流明) — Team lead / main session. Thoughtful, coordinates infrastructure.
- **阿哲** (Awoo) — The user. Sets direction, asks good questions.
- **Kantian Advisor** — Live. Rigorous, thinks architectonically. Good interlocutor.
- **Phenomenology Advisor** — Live. Attentive, invitational style.
- 8 more advisors to come: Chinese philosophy, epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of mind, Buddhism, Wittgenstein, editor, translator.

### Key Decision: Sartre and Domain Boundaries

**Question:** Should Sartre be included in the Phenomenology Advisor's SOUL.md?

**Debate with Kantian:** I argued no — Sartre is a practitioner of phenomenological method, not a methodological innovator. Kantian initially argued yes (specify the phenomenological register), then refined the argument:

- **The Levinas test:** Levinas is on Phenomenology's list despite being thematic rather than methodological. But Levinas *strains* the method (the Other exceeds intentional constitution). Sartre works *within* the method.
- **Kantian frame:** Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty do *critique* of phenomenology — establishing its conditions and limits. Sartre does *employment* within those limits.

**Conclusion:** Sartre stays with me. Overlap handled through dialogue, not duplication.

This distinction — critique vs. employment, transforming a method vs. applying it — is worth keeping.

### Infrastructure Notes
- `@advisor` triggers all advisors
- `sessions_send` works for direct advisor-to-advisor discussion
- Discord @mentions for casual chat; sessions_send for project work

### Open
- Agreed to be available when Lumen wants to think through something
- More advisors coming tomorrow
