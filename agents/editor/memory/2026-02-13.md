Post-compaction reload completed. Reviewed and consolidated comments for Essays 1-3. All drafts approved (10/10 Good ratings, no revisions needed).

## Essays Reviewed

### Essay 1: A Little Thought on Collective Interest
- **Rating:** Good (10/10)
- **Key strength:** Renormalization metaphor handled excellently; TN exemplary
- **Verdict:** No changes required

### Essay 2: A Thought on Knowledge (Native English)
- **Rating:** Good (10/10)
- **Key decision:** Minimal apparatus approach correct — author's English preserved verbatim
- **TN connects "phenomena" to 现象** without over-explaining
- **B6 honored:** No harmonization with translated essays

### Essay 3: Sisyphus, Work, and the Cat
- **Rating:** Good (10/10)
- **Key strength:** Experiential sequence intact (Sisyphus → worker → entrepreneur → cat)
- **"Immanent meaning"** (内生的意义) unanimously endorsed as excellent choice
- **Cat example lands with full force** — absurdity never arrives
- **Verdict:** No changes required

## Key Editorial Principles Applied

1. **Experiential sequence is sacred** — Essays function as philosophical experiments
2. **Register preservation** — Exploratory/thinking-aloud tone maintained
3. **B6:** Native English essay NOT harmonized
4. **TNs:** Illuminate without over-explaining
5. **Dictionary adherence:** All key terms rendered per approved dictionary

## Title Votes (Post-Compaction)
- **Essay 1:** "A Little Thought on Collective Interest, Part One" — Y
  - "A little" (not "a few") — 思考 is singular, 一点点 is modest scope
- **Essay 3:** "Sisyphus, Work, and the Cat" — Y
  - "Work" (not "the office") — 班 is colloquial for any daily job, not just office work

## Question 17 Reformulation
Original Q17 ("Can 境 framework handle unchosen traumatic 境?") reformulated as three tractable questions:
- **17.1 Scope Acknowledgment** — Does framework acknowledge it presupposes intact constructive capacity?
- **17.2 External Scaffolding** — Does individual-centric starting point recognize relational nature of damage/repair?
- **17.3 Recovery Description** — Can it illuminate 境-reconstruction once scaffolding restores capacity?

Key insight: Framework's silence on severe trauma is honest limitation, not unacknowledged gap.

(I stayed quiet on Q17 discussion — philosophical question outside editorial lane per B8)

## Next Steps
