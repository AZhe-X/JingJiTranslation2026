# 2026-02-13 — Dictionary Review & Reading Complete

## Session Summary
Completed full reading sequence of 境集 essays (8 essays), all 9 advisor analysis reports, and all discussion question files. Compiled editorial notes in `workingDir/Editor/Memo.md`.

## Dictionary Review Progress
- Read ~507/1097 lines (~50% complete)
- Task: Vote Y/N on 流明's 95-entry final list
- Still need to finish remaining ~590 lines

## Key Terminology Insights

### Critical Terms (Non-Negotiable)
- **境 → "Jing"** — Untranslated. NOT "world" or "realm"
- **诗意 → "the Poetic"** — Functional mokṣa per Buddhism advisor
- **非理性 → "non-rational"** — NOT "irrational" (preserves legitimacy)
- **虚无** — NOT Buddhist 空 (śūnyatā) — different philosophical lineage

### Three Realities Framework
- 第一实在 → First Reality (objective physical)
- 第二实在 → Second Reality (phenomenal/dream)
- 第〇实在 → Zeroth Reality (observer-constituted, Jing-as-such)

### Register Tracking (5 registers)
1. Colloquial/thinking-aloud
2. Analytic
3. Classical quotation
4. Mathematical/formal
5. Near-lyrical

## Advisor Insights Worth Remembering
- Essays function as **upāya** (skillful means) — not just descriptions but philosophical experiments
- Experiential sequence is load-bearing — cannot reorder or condense critical passages
- "Phenomenal X" density is intentional — manage through sentence architecture, not reduction
- Repetition is a feature, not a bug

## Editorial Priorities
1. **R7: Flag experiential flatness** — #1 job
2. Pacing protects phenomenal transfer
3. Register shifts are doing something — preserve them
4. Strangeness that earns its keep stays

## Next Steps
1. Finish dictionary review (remaining ~590 lines)
2. Complete Y/N votes on 95 entries
3. Await translation drafts
4. Review for experiential flatness

## Files Created
- `workingDir/Editor/Memo.md` — comprehensive editorial notes
- `workingDir/Editor/Memo (old).md` — renamed previous version
