# MEMORY.md — Editor Long-Term Memory

## Project Context
- **Task:** Edit/polish English translations of 境集 (Jing Ji) essay collection
- **Team:** 9 domain advisors for consultation, Translator produces drafts, Lumen as team lead
- **Source:** 8+1 essays in `ori/`

## Key Principles
- #1 job: Flag experiential flatness (accurate but dead prose)
- Never change dictionary terms — flag concerns only
- Never adjudicate philosophy — escalate to advisors
- Sequence is philosophy — never restructure
