# MEMORY.md — Editor Long-Term Memory

## Project Context
- **Task:** Edit/polish English translations of 境集 (Jing Ji) essay collection
- **Team:** 9 domain advisors for consultation, Translator produces drafts, Lumen as team lead
- **Source:** 8+1 essays in `ori/` (Essay 2 natively English)
- **Working files:** `workingDir/Editor/Memo.md` has comprehensive essay-by-essay notes

## Key Principles
- #1 job: Flag experiential flatness (accurate but dead prose)
- Never change dictionary terms — flag concerns only
- Never adjudicate philosophy — escalate to advisors
- Sequence is philosophy — never restructure
- Essays are **upāya** — they transmit experiential shifts, not just describe them

## Critical Terminology
- **境 → "Jing"** (untranslated, NOT "world")
- **诗意 → "the Poetic"** (functional liberation)
- **非理性 → "non-rational"** (NOT "irrational")
- **虚无 ≠ 空** (different philosophical traditions)
- **Three Realities:** First (physical), Second (phenomenal), Zeroth (Jing-as-such)

## 5 Registers to Track
1. Colloquial/thinking-aloud
2. Analytic
3. Classical quotation
4. Mathematical/formal
5. Near-lyrical

## Editorial Decisions
- "Phenomenal X" density: preserve all repetition, manage through sentence architecture
- Intentional repetition is load-bearing — never vary for style
- Essay 2 (native English) must NOT be harmonized with translated essays

## Advisor Consultations
- Buddhism advisor confirmed 诗意 as potentially genuine mokṣa
- All advisors agree: experiential sequence is sacred
- Phenomenology advisor emphasized pacing as content-bearing
- Q17 reformulated: Framework's silence on severe trauma = honest limitation, not gap
