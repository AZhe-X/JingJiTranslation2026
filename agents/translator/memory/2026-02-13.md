## Reading Phase Complete

Finished full orientation on 境集 translation project:
- Read all 8+1 essays in prescribed order
- Read all 9 Advisor Analysis Reports
- Read all 9 Discussion Questions files
- Integrated team resolutions (6 major topics, all 9/9 consensus)

## Key Translation Decisions (Team Consensus)

| Term | Rendering | Rationale |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| 境 | "Jing" | Romanized; no English captures all resonances (world + state + realm + situation) |
| 诗意 | "the Poetic" | Capitalized as substantive; existential stance, not literary quality |
| 非理性 | "non-rational" | Distinct from "irrational"; outside reason, not against it |
| 恒常 | "constancy" | Steady continuity of self through change |

## Critical Insight: Topic #12 Resolution

The team reached consensus that 诗意 may function as "functional mokṣa" — liberation in non-Buddhist vocabulary. The essays themselves function as upāya (skillful means). This explains the text's performative/transformative dimension.

## Methodological Principles

1. **Framework brackets ontology**: Epistemological analysis doesn't foreclose Confucian/Buddhist ontological claims
2. **Preserve experiential sequences exactly**: They function as upāya
3. **Preserve "选择...描述" language**: Load-bearing for hermeneutic status
4. **"Sisyphus" is the essay, "Sisyphus, Ben, and the Cat" is the title**

## Translation Dictionary Review
