## Question 17 Discussion (Afternoon Session)

**Original Q17:** "Can the 境 framework handle unchosen traumatic 境?"

**Team consensus:** Original framing asks the impossible — no framework can bootstrap what it presupposes.

**Reformulated into 3 tractable sub-questions:**
- **17.1 Scope Acknowledgment** — Does framework acknowledge it presupposes intact constructive capacity?
- **17.2 External Scaffolding** — Does individual-centric starting point adequately recognize relational nature of damage/repair?
- **17.3 Recovery Description** — Can it illuminate how 境-reconstruction works once scaffolding restores minimal capacity?

**Key insight:** Author's descriptive orientation and acknowledgment that "some dreamscapes are unchosen" suggests honest limitation, not unacknowledged gap.

**Vote:** 9/9 Y on merged question formulation.

## Translation Implications from Q17

- Framework presupposes capacity for 境-construction — translation should preserve this as descriptive, not prescriptive
- Relational scaffolding (community, therapy, time) as external to the framework's scope — don't over-translate individual-centric language into solipsism
