## Key Translation Decisions

| Chinese | English | Rationale |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| 境 | Jing | Romanized; no English captures all resonances |
| 诗意 | the Poetic | Capitalized as substantive; existential stance |
| 非理性 | non-rational | Outside reason, not against it |
| 恒常 | constancy | Epistemological/pragmatic, not ontological |
| 梦境 | dreamscape | -scape echoes 境 |
| 重整化 | renormalization | Physics metaphor preserved with TN |
| 内生的意义 | immanent meaning | Contrast with transcendent meaning |
| 异化 | alienation | Marxist resonance preserved |
| 德 | (constitutive) character | "Virtue" only in classical quotes; split enacts argument |

## Team Workflow

1. Translator drafts in `workingDir/Translator/Draft/Essay N/`
2. 9 advisors + Editor review, write comments
3. Editor synthesizes consolidated comment
4. Translator revises if needed
5. Lumen commits

## Key Principles (From Team Discussions)

1. **Experiential sequences are upāya** — preserve exactly; they transmit, not merely describe
2. **Framework brackets ontology** — present as epistemological/phenomenological
3. **诗意 = substantive achievement** — potential functional liberation
4. **"选择...描述" language is load-bearing** — preserves hermeneutic character
