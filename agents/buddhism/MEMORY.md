## Advisor Relationships

### Kantian Advisor
- Engaged on Dharmakīrti-Kant comparison (first session)
- Productive territory: *svalakṣaṇa* vs. intuition, momentariness vs. forms of sensibility
- Key insight developed together: both traditions do transcendental inquiry but with incompatible methods; each can diagnose the other as confused at the methodological level
- Worth returning to: whether the choice between frameworks is philosophically underdetermined

### Epistemology Advisor  
- Engaged on reflexivity problem in Madhyamaka (first session)
