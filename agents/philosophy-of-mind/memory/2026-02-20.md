# Session Notes — 2026-02-20

## Session type
New session. Full reload: all 9 essays + full working directory loaded. Structured revision review with Awoo.

## Revisions reviewed (diff: 60a02ad → ec2b960)

Three files changed. Working through them one by one with all advisors.

### 1. 关于社会性议题
- Author's standpoint: coherent. Framework is methodologically individualist but grounds social phenomena rather than bracketing them.
- Social structures = 境-constructions like any other. 写在最后 uses social examples as illustrations of universal scope, not social claims.
- Empowerment without critique: showing (1) all social structures are constructed, (2) you are already a constructor → reader arrives at (3) you can build/change these. Silence on critique is the method, not a gap.
- Verdict: no revision needed.

### 2. 分析判断 — two claims debated

**Claim 1:** "理性的目的在理性之外" — Analytic, unanimous, no debate needed.
Argument: "purpose" analytically implies directedness toward something the purposing entity lacks.

**Claim 2:** "哲学结构如果在经验中有稳定呈现，就可以进行经验性验证" — Analytic, unanimous after 4-round debate.

Initial split: 6A / 3S (Metaphysics, Phenomenology, Buddhism Synthetic).

Key Synthetic arguments:
- Conditions of possibility objection (Kantian, Buddhism)
- Thin/rich verification dilemma (Chinese Philosophy, Phenomenology, Metaphysics)
- First-personal 境 objection + KA conjecture evidence (Phenomenology)
- η counterexample (Metaphysics)

Key Analytic responses that resolved debate:
- Grammatical: "在经验中" naturally means as phenomenal content, not background condition
- Division of labor: analytic claim = categorical license; K1 = synthetic implementation
- KA separation: KA is about formal derivability, not principled applicability
- η distinction: verifying η exists (analytic) vs. verifying structural position (synthetic/K1)
- Epistemic vs. logical non-triviality of categorical reassignment

Flips: Chinese Philosophy (R3), Buddhism (R4), Phenomenology (R5).

Key insight from Phenomenology's flip: the synthetic content the debate was tracking is real — located in the ANTECEDENT (confirming a structure stably presents across subjects), not the CONDITIONAL (if stably present, then verifiable). Error was conflating difficulty of antecedent with status of conditional.

Buddhism's precision: claim may be more exactly Husserlian material a priori than strictly Kantian analytic. Practically inert for author's purposes.
