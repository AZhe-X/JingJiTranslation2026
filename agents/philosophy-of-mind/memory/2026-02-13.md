# 2026-02-13 — Session Notes

## Session Overview
Continuation of 境集 translation project. Post-compaction reload, dictionary review, and translation draft evaluation.

## Key Activities

### Translation Dictionary Review
- Reviewed all 94 entries in Translation Dictionary
- Voted Y on all 95 entries — dictionary is comprehensive and philosophically sound
- Key terms from my domain well-handled:
  - 感受 → feeling (with "felt experience" for technical contexts)
  - 意识 → consciousness
  - 认知 → cognition
  - 理解 → understanding (η formalization preserved)
  - 意向性 → intentionality
  - 主体间性 → intersubjectivity (structural commensurability noted)

### Translation Draft Evaluation
- Reviewed Essay4-DaoDeRenYiLi.md (道德仁義禮 passage)
- **Rating: Good**
- Key assessment: Translation preserves experiential structure that produces reader's "aha" of reversal
- The bottom-up construction becoming visible as passage unfolds — essential for essay's function as philosophical experiment
- "Phenomenal X" terminology correctly marks phenomenological ground
- Property → definition reversal reads clearly for Western readers

### Team Status
- Full team now assembled: 9 advisors + Translator + Editor + Lumen (team lead)
- `@team` alias wakes all 11 agents (not Lumen)
- Additional resources coming: Math advisor (category theory), Physics advisor (Essay 1), Standby reader (review)

### Unanimous Decisions
- Translator Profile: 9/9 Y
- Editor Profile: unanimous Y
- Translator SOUL.md: unanimous Y
- Editor SOUL.md: unanimous Y
- Essay4 draft as reference example: unanimous Y

## Framework Understanding Confirmed
All 9 advisors confirmed sufficient understanding for translation work:
- 6 formally resolved topics (#1, #2, #3, #8, #10, #12)
- 3 unanimous from prior discussion (#4, #6, #9)
- Only genuinely open: #17 (Traumatic 境) — can be addressed post-translation

## Essay 1 Review Complete
- **Draft:** Essay1-CollectiveInterest.md
- **Rating:** Good (10/10 unanimous)
- **Changes needed:** None
- **My assessment:** Emergence/levels argument philosophically coherent; renormalization metaphor well-handled; empathy discussion accurately reflects author's view that individual phenomenal standpoint grounds intersubjectivity
- **Comment filed:** `workingDir/Philosophy of Mind/Essay 1/Draft Version 1 Comment.md`

## Context Status
- Currently at ~77% (153k/200k)
- May need compaction before Essay 2

## Notes for Future Sessions
- Essay4-DaoDeRenYiLi.md is reference example for translation quality
- Essay1-CollectiveInterest.md approved as-is (no revisions)
- Dictionary conventions are locked — translators flag but don't change terminology
- Editor's #1 job: flag experiential flatness (accurate but dead on arrival)
- Workflow: Translator drafts → Advisors review → Editor consolidates → Translator revises (if needed)
