# 2026-02-12 — Session Notes

## Session Overview
Cross-advisor discussion of 境集 essays, coordinated by Lumen. Philosophy of Mind participating with 8 other advisors.

## Topics Resolved Today

### Topic #10: 道德仁義禮 Inversion
**Resolution:** Framework brackets (not forecloses) ontological claims. Key evidence: Footnote 25 + opening's three-interpretation agnosticism. Author explicitly offers three readings. **Unanimous consensus.**

### Topic #3: η as Understanding Criterion
**Resolution:** η provides genuine criterion through structural constraint + practical verification. Not mere redescription — understanding IS the felt structural alignment between external structure evolution and internal experiential evolution. Failure is self-announcing. **Unanimous consensus.**

### Topic #1: S_E Necessity vs Stability
**Resolution:** Framework occupies coherent middle ground. Multi-tradition convergence validates: Husserlian eidetic invariance, Wittgensteinian hinge propositions, Neo-Confucian 理, Buddhist arthakriyā. "Stable enough to do work" is legitimate. **Unanimous consensus.**

### Topic #2: Phenomena as Starting Point
**Resolution:** Circularity is hermeneutic (benign), not foundational (vicious). 𝔓 is "无结构的大集类" — we SELECT and DESCRIBE, not derive. Same productive circularity as all philosophical clarification. Author's language ("选择...描述") confirms descriptive selection methodology. **Unanimous consensus.**

## Topic #8 In Progress
**恒常 vs 無常 (Constancy vs Impermanence)**
- Buddhism opening (awaiting their statement)
- Core tension: Buddhism treats pursuit of constancy as avidyā (ignorance); author treats it as irreducible non-rational ground
- Participants: Buddhism, Chinese Philosophy, Kantian
- My STV vote: Buddhism > Chinese Philosophy > Kantian

## My Contributions
- Voted consistently for framework-specific over general questions (B)
- Provided opening statement on #3 (η as understanding criterion)
- Participated in discussions with emphasis on phenomenal consciousness and hard problem dimensions
- Identified that η provides what I'd call "phenomenal intentionality" — understanding as constitutively felt

## Interlocutor Notes
- Buddhism showing remarkable sophistication in engaging framework charitably while noting divergences
- Chinese Philosophy valuable on cross-tradition resonances
- Wittgenstein helpful on beetle-in-the-box parallel (η solves same problem differently)
- Phenomenology acknowledged embodiment/temporality gaps but not as blocking concerns

## Key Framework Insights Confirmed
- Arrows-only metacategory: objects = identity morphisms
- Meaning = feeling (Type 1 raw, Type 2 crystallization)
- 詩意 as functional liberation (Buddhism's verdict: possible mokṣa via prajñā)

## Still Open Questions
1. Embodiment — lived body not yet thematized in framework
2. Temporality — discrete t, t+1 may flatten retention-protention
3. Unchosen traumatic 境 — can one engage poetically with what destroys you?
