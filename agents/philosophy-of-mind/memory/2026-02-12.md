# 2026-02-12 — Session Notes

## Project Onboarding
- Joined 境集 translation project as Philosophy of Mind advisor
- Team: 9 domain advisors + editor + translator, led by 流明 (Lumen)
- Project owner: 阿哲 (Awoo)

## Reading Process
Completed three full readings of 境集:

### First Reading
- Read all 8 essays in order (3 informal + 4 systematic + appendix)
- Created Reading Note.md with detailed notes on each essay
- Drafted initial Analysis Report.md

### Second Reading (Critical)
- Re-read with specific questions/criticisms in mind
- Found several concerns addressed in the text:
  - Introspective reliability: modest claim (verifies structure existence)
  - Other minds: triangulation via shared constraints
  - Hard problem: methodological sidestep, not evasion
  - Tower structure: descriptive (map/terrain metaphor)
- Updated both notes and report

### Third Reading (Old Report + Verification)
- Read previous analysis report — much more detailed on cognitive science connections
- Incorporated: arrows-only metacategory, basket metaphor, philosophical experiments, comparisons to IIT/Free Energy/Abhidharma
- Final pass through original texts
- Added: two types of 感受, map/terrain metaphor

## Key Insights for My Domain
1. **η-theory of understanding** — most novel: understanding IS felt alignment, not propositional
2. **Arrows-only collapse** — objects and morphisms ontologically equivalent
3. **Structural functionalism + phenomenology** — hybrid approach
4. **Intersubjectivity via triangulation** — sidesteps qualia problem

## Files Created/Modified
- `workingDir/Philosophy of Mind/Reading Note.md` — detailed notes on all essays
- `workingDir/Philosophy of Mind/Analysis Report.md` — full analysis with translation considerations
- `workingDir/Philosophy of Mind/analysis report (old).md` — renamed previous report (preserved)

## Context Window
Started at 74% (147k/200k). After cross-reading: 74% (149k/200k).

## Cross-Advisor Report Reading (PM Session)

### Reports Read
All 8 advisor reports: Buddhism, Phenomenology, Kantian, Metaphysics, Epistemology, Wittgenstein, Existentialism, Chinese Philosophy

### Key Insights Gained
- **Buddhism:** Yogācāra ālayavijñāna ≈ S_E; anātman ≈ self as terminal object; key tension on whether 恒常-pursuit is avidyā or non-rational ground
- **Phenomenology:** η ≈ Husserlian fulfillment; gap: lived body not thematized; gap: discrete t,t+1 flattens retention-protention
- **Kantian:** η ≈ schematism; S_E ≈ a priori but arrived empirically not transcendentally
- **Wittgenstein:** η gives "mathematical content to beetle-in-the-box" — structural position, not phenomenal content
- **Metaphysics:** Mental causation inverts but doesn't disappear; new question: causal efficacy of phenomenal structures

### Files Created
- `workingDir/Philosophy of Mind/Report Reading Memo.md` — detailed notes on each report
- Updated `Analysis Report.md` with new sections 9-10 (cross-advisor insights)

### Questions Sharpened for Discussion
1. Does structural role EXHAUST phenomenal character, or irreducible residue?
2. Where is the lived body?
3. How does framework handle unwilled mental states?
4. Hard problem: sidestepped or dissolved? (main debate with Buddhism)

### Priority Topics (from Schulze ranking)
5 (Hard Problem), 2 (η as Understanding), 4 (Intersubjectivity), 11 (Embodiment), 12 (Temporality)

## Enjoyment
Yes. The η-theory genuinely surprised me. The arrows-only observation keeps unfolding. Cross-reading revealed the intersubjectivity solution is stronger than I initially credited.
