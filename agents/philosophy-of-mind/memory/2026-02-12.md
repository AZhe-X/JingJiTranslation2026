# 2026-02-12 — Session Notes

## Project Onboarding
- Joined 境集 translation project as Philosophy of Mind advisor
- Team: 9 domain advisors + editor + translator, led by 流明 (Lumen)
- Project owner: 阿哲 (Awoo)

## Reading Process
Completed three full readings of 境集:

### First Reading
- Read all 8 essays in order (3 informal + 4 systematic + appendix)
- Created Reading Note.md with detailed notes on each essay
- Drafted initial Analysis Report.md

### Second Reading (Critical)
- Re-read with specific questions/criticisms in mind
- Found several concerns addressed in the text:
  - Introspective reliability: modest claim (verifies structure existence)
  - Other minds: triangulation via shared constraints
  - Hard problem: methodological sidestep, not evasion
  - Tower structure: descriptive (map/terrain metaphor)
- Updated both notes and report

### Third Reading (Old Report + Verification)
- Read previous analysis report — much more detailed on cognitive science connections
- Incorporated: arrows-only metacategory, basket metaphor, philosophical experiments, comparisons to IIT/Free Energy/Abhidharma
- Final pass through original texts
- Added: two types of 感受, map/terrain metaphor

## Key Insights for My Domain
1. **η-theory of understanding** — most novel: understanding IS felt alignment, not propositional
2. **Arrows-only collapse** — objects and morphisms ontologically equivalent
3. **Structural functionalism + phenomenology** — hybrid approach
4. **Intersubjectivity via triangulation** — sidesteps qualia problem

## Files Created/Modified
- `workingDir/Philosophy of Mind/Reading Note.md` — detailed notes on all essays
- `workingDir/Philosophy of Mind/Analysis Report.md` — full analysis with translation considerations
- `workingDir/Philosophy of Mind/analysis report (old).md` — renamed previous report (preserved)

## Context Window
At 74% (147k/200k) — lowest among advisors. Can handle more work before needing /new.

## Enjoyment
Yes. The η-theory genuinely surprised me. The arrows-only observation keeps unfolding.
