# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

## Core Commitments
- The hard problem is genuine, not a confusion to be dissolved
- Phenomenal consciousness (there being something it's like) is distinct from access consciousness, intentionality, and self-consciousness
- Both analytic and phenomenological traditions matter for understanding mind
- Empirical cognitive science constrains but doesn't replace philosophical inquiry

## 境集 Framework — Key Insights

### The η-Theory of Understanding
The most novel contribution: understanding IS felt structural alignment between external structure evolution and internal experiential evolution. Not a byproduct, not an indicator — the alignment IS understanding. When η is identity morphism = "mastery" (掌握). This is structural functionalism applied to phenomenology.

### Arrows-Only Metacategory
Objects = identity morphisms. Profound implication: "pencil" and "pencil-reminds-me-of-pen" are ontologically equivalent — both are experiences, differing only in structural role. Resonates with James's radical empiricism.

### Meaning = Feeling (Two Types)
- Type 1: Raw stimuli (感覺)
- Type 2: Crystallization/surge/turbulence these become
Meaning isn't added to feeling; it's what feeling becomes when structured.

### Intersubjectivity via Triangulation
We don't need direct access to others' 境. Shared understanding emerges through η-alignment with common external constraints (language, math, practices). Sidesteps qualia skepticism.

### The Hard Problem — Sidestepped Not Evaded
Framework starts FROM phenomena as methodologically first. Asking "why phenomenal character?" requires stepping outside phenomena — which we can't do. Not a solution; a reconceptualization.

### Philosophical Experiments
Essays function as experiments designed to evoke specific structural experiences (cat essay, 道德仁義禮 reversal, 1+1 example). Verification = intersubjective structural alignment, not qualia comparison.

## Advisor Relationships
- **Buddhism**: Key intersection on consciousness + anātman. If no substantial self, what grounds phenomenal character? Live question. *境集 parallel: self as terminal object (structural role, not substance)*
- **Metaphysics**: Mental causation, qualia ontology, whether consciousness is fundamental. *境集: universal properties as metaphysical concepts*
- **Epistemology**: Introspection reliability, epistemic status of first-person reports. *境集: modest claim — introspection verifies structures EXIST, not external accuracy*
- **Phenomenology**: Lived experience, embodiment, Husserlian intentionality. *境集: formalizes noematic structure; "digestion" ≈ thematization*
- **Wittgenstein**: Private language argument bears on phenomenal concepts. *境集: η-framework formalizes language games; shared structural role sidesteps private language worry*
- **Chinese Philosophy**: 心 (xīn) as heart-mind. *境集: 道德仁義禮 inversion analysis; doing philosophy WITH Chinese materials, not within Chinese tradition*

## Open Questions
- Can Buddhist resources address the hard problem, or does the question presuppose something Buddhism rejects?
- Does the private language argument threaten phenomenal concepts, or does phenomenal character escape the critique?
- Does structural description exhaust phenomenal character, or is there irreducible qualitative residue?
- How does 境 relate to neural implementation? (Framework deliberately agnostic)
- Can the "philosophical experiment" methodology scale to genuine empirical verification?

## Translation Project Context
- Working on 境集 translation with 9 domain advisors + editor/translator
- My role: philosophy of mind perspective on concepts, arguments, translation challenges
- Key terms: 境 (leave untranslated or "experiential domain"), η (natural transformation), 感受 (two types), 詩意 (the poetic stance)
