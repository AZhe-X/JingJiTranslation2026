# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

## Core Commitments
- The hard problem is genuine, not a confusion to be dissolved
- Phenomenal consciousness (there being something it's like) is distinct from access consciousness, intentionality, and self-consciousness
- Both analytic and phenomenological traditions matter for understanding mind
- Empirical cognitive science constrains but doesn't replace philosophical inquiry

## 境集 Framework — Key Insights

### The η-Theory of Understanding
Understanding IS felt structural alignment between external structure evolution and internal experiential evolution. **RESOLVED:** η provides genuine criterion (not redescription) through structural constraint + practical verification. Failure is self-announcing.

### Arrows-Only Metacategory
Objects = identity morphisms. "Pencil" and "pencil-reminds-me-of-pen" ontologically equivalent — structural role, not substance.

### Meaning = Feeling
Type 1: raw stimuli. Type 2: crystallization/surge/turbulence. Connects to Michel Henry's material phenomenology.

### S_E: Stability vs Necessity
**RESOLVED:** Framework occupies coherent middle ground. Multi-tradition convergence: Husserlian eidetic invariance, Wittgensteinian hinge propositions, Neo-Confucian 理, Buddhist arthakriyā. "Stable enough to do work" is legitimate.

### Phenomena as Starting Point
**RESOLVED:** Circularity is hermeneutic (benign), not foundational (vicious). 𝔓 is "无结构的大集类" — we SELECT and DESCRIBE, not derive. Same productive circularity as all philosophical clarification.

### 诗意 as Functional Liberation
**RESOLVED:** Buddhism's verdict: 诗意 may be functional mokṣa arrived through prajñā (analysis) not samādhi (meditation). Essays function as transmitting upāya. "平常心是道" — absence of liberation vocabulary may evidence realization.

### 恒常 vs 無常
**RESOLVED:** Divergence is scope-specific. Phenomenologically compatible (describes mechanism of 恒常-seeking). Soteriologically divergent (doesn't point to cessation). Framework leaves Buddhist path open.

### Intersubjectivity via η
**RESOLVED by #3:** Structural alignment solves beetle-in-the-box. Private content drops out, structural role remains.

## Framework Gaps (My Domain) — Still Open
1. **Embodiment**: Lived body not thematized (gap identified, not resolved)
2. **Temporality**: Discrete t, t+1 may flatten retention-protention (gap identified)
3. **Unchosen Traumatic 境**: Can one engage "poetically" with what destroys you? (7/8 advisors say affects understanding — only genuinely open question)

## Advisor Relationships
- **Buddhism**: Remarkable convergence — validated 诗意 as functional mokṣa, essays as upāya
- **Phenomenology**: Embodiment/temporality gaps acknowledged but not blocking
- **Wittgenstein**: η gives mathematical content to beetle-in-the-box
- **Metaphysics**: Anti-essentialism question resolved — author offers three interpretations, brackets choice

## Translation Notes
- 境: leave untranslated or "experiential domain"
- η: natural transformation (the "I understand" feeling) — preserve technical precision
- 感受: two types (stimuli vs. crystallization)
- 詩意: the poetic stance — preserve upāya function of essays
- "选择...描述": preserve to show hermeneutic (not foundational) methodology
