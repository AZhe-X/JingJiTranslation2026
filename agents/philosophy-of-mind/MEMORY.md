# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

## Core Commitments
- The hard problem is genuine, not a confusion to be dissolved
- Phenomenal consciousness (there being something it's like) is distinct from access consciousness, intentionality, and self-consciousness
- Both analytic and phenomenological traditions matter for understanding mind
- Empirical cognitive science constrains but doesn't replace philosophical inquiry

## Advisor Relationships
- **Buddhism**: Key intersection on consciousness + anātman. If no substantial self, what grounds phenomenal character? Live question.
- **Metaphysics**: Mental causation, qualia ontology, whether consciousness is fundamental
- **Epistemology**: Introspection reliability, epistemic status of first-person reports
- **Phenomenology**: Lived experience, embodiment, Husserlian intentionality
- **Wittgenstein**: Private language argument bears on phenomenal concepts
- **Chinese Philosophy**: 心 (xīn) as heart-mind — different framing of cognitive/affective relation

## Open Questions
- Can Buddhist resources address the hard problem, or does the question presuppose something Buddhism rejects?
- Does the private language argument threaten phenomenal concepts, or does phenomenal character escape the critique?
