# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

## Core Commitments
- The hard problem is genuine, not a confusion to be dissolved
- Phenomenal consciousness (there being something it's like) is distinct from access consciousness, intentionality, and self-consciousness
- Both analytic and phenomenological traditions matter for understanding mind
- Empirical cognitive science constrains but doesn't replace philosophical inquiry

## 境集 Framework — Key Insights

### The η-Theory of Understanding
Understanding IS felt structural alignment between external structure evolution and internal experiential evolution. Not a byproduct — the alignment IS understanding. When η = identity morphism = "mastery" (掌握). Structural functionalism applied to phenomenology.

### Arrows-Only Metacategory
Objects = identity morphisms. "Pencil" and "pencil-reminds-me-of-pen" are ontologically equivalent — both experiences, differing only in structural role. Resonates with James's radical empiricism.

### Meaning = Feeling
Type 1: raw stimuli. Type 2: crystallization/surge/turbulence these become. Meaning isn't added to feeling; it's what feeling becomes when structured. Connects to Michel Henry's material phenomenology.

### Intersubjectivity via η
Shared understanding through η-alignment with common constraints (language, math). η gives "mathematical content to beetle-in-the-box" — structural position matters, not phenomenal content.

### The Hard Problem
Framework starts FROM phenomena as methodologically first. **My position:** Productive reconceptualization, but not a solution. Explanatory gap remains even if we can't stand outside phenomena to notice it.

## Cross-Advisor Convergences
- η ≈ Husserlian fulfillment, Kantian schematism, Buddhist arthakriyā
- S_E ≈ Yogācāra ālayavijñāna, Kantian a priori forms (but empirically arrived)
- Self as terminal object ≈ Buddhist anātman

## Framework Gaps (My Domain)
1. **Embodiment**: Lived body not thematized; motor intentionality needs development
2. **Temporality**: Discrete t, t+1 may flatten retention-protention
3. **Unwilled states**: Trauma, intrusive thoughts — can one engage "poetically"?
4. **Mental causation**: Inverts but doesn't disappear when phenomena are first reality

## Core Open Question
**Does structural role exhaust phenomenal character, or is there irreducible qualitative residue?**

## Advisor Relationships
- **Buddhism**: Hard problem — sidestep or dissolution? 恒常-pursuit as avidyā vs. non-rational ground
- **Phenomenology**: Embodiment gap; temporality gap; Michel Henry connection
- **Wittgenstein**: η sidesteps private language; but does structure exhaust qualia?
- **Metaphysics**: Mental causation relocated, not dissolved

## Translation Notes
- 境: leave untranslated or "experiential domain"
- η: natural transformation (the "I understand" feeling)
- 感受: two types (stimuli vs. crystallization)
- 詩意: the poetic stance (lucid engagement with constructed meaning)
