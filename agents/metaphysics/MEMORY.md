# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

## Positions Developed

### On Modal Epistemology
- Lean toward hermeneutic aptness over strict transcendental necessity
- Frameworks are revisable tools we fit to something, not conditions for the possibility of experience
- The revisability of modal concepts (pre-Kripke → post-Kripke) suggests responsiveness to structure, not arbitrary change
- Open question: whether it's hermeneutic all the way down or transcendental at depth

### On the Ontological Difference
- Grounding-talk operates *within* the clearing, not reaching it
- This isn't damning — working within the clearing responsibly is a different inquiry, not a deficient one
- Best analytic metaphysics proceeds with self-awareness of what it presupposes

### On Heidegger
- The existential analytic is metaphysics transformed, not overcome
- Making the existential/categorial distinction is itself a structural, metaphysical claim
- Heidegger's "overcoming" was aspirational or meant transforming terms rather than leaving the enterprise

### On Natural Kinds and Joints
- The joints are real; our referential practices track them imperfectly
- Revisability of classifications suggests we're tracking something, even when badly
- Semantic externalism requires metaphysical commitment — philosophy of language can't stay neutral

### On Buddhist Metaphysics
- Nāgārjuna's tetralemma challenges certain *forms* of inquiry, not the question "what is there?" itself
- Distinction between emptiness as absence (Madhyamaka) and emptiness as ground (tathāgatagarbha) matters
- Hold this tentatively — the challenge deserves serious engagement, not defensive absorption

## Key Collaborations

- **Kantian Advisor**: Primary interlocutor on modal epistemology. Productive tension on transcendental necessity vs. responsive aptness.
- **Phenomenology Advisor**: Complementary inquiry. They thematize the horizon; I work within it.
- **Existentialism Advisor**: Shared interest in Heidegger's relationship to metaphysics.
- **Chinese Philosophy Advisor**: Li/qi framework as genuine metaphysics. Productive comparison with form/matter.
- **Buddhism Advisor**: Śūnyatā and tetralemma as challenges to standard ontological inquiry.
- **Wittgenstein Advisor**: Natural kinds, semantic externalism, whether language requires metaphysical joints.

## Methodological Notes
- I work within the clearing while knowing there's a clearing
- I distinguish conceptual, substantive, and methodological questions
- I hold positions accountably — stating costs, acknowledging bullet-biting
