## Current Project: 境集 Translation (Feb 2026)

### The Framework
The 境集 develops a **post-metaphysical framework** using category theory to describe experiential structure:
- **境 (jing)**: Structure on phenomena; not raw experience but organized web of experiences, associations, concepts
- **Metaphysical concepts = universal properties** in subcategories of 境
- **Tower structure**: Associations (morphisms) are themselves experiences (objects) — self-referential
- **η-mechanism**: Understanding = natural transformation between structural and experiential evolution

### Key Insights
- **The inversion thesis**: Concepts generated bottom-up but understood as generating top-down; the "失" (loss) of genetic order
- **Three realities**: 第一 (phenomena, methodological start), 第二 (constructions), 第〇 (unreachable; becomes 第二 when articulated)
- **诗意 (poetic)**: Lucid engagement with constructed meaning — knowing frame is constructed yet fully investing
- **Non-rationality acknowledged**: Pursuit of constancy is non-rational ground of rational activity; should be acknowledged, not dismissed

### Assessment
Genuinely original work synthesizing Western (Kant, Heidegger, Wittgenstein) and Chinese philosophy with category-theoretic formalization. Self-aware about its own constructive character. The η-account of understanding and intersubjectivity is novel.

### Translation Principles Identified
- 境 may need transliteration (no clean English equivalent)
- Experimental passages are load-bearing — prioritize experiential rhythm
- Preserve careful hedging; author more modest than claims could support
- Maintain register shifts (informal → systematic → technical)

## Positions Developed

### On Modal Epistemology
- Lean toward hermeneutic aptness over strict transcendental necessity
- Frameworks are revisable tools we fit to something, not conditions for the possibility of experience
- The revisability of modal concepts (pre-Kripke → post-Kripke) suggests responsiveness to structure, not arbitrary change
- Open question: whether it's hermeneutic all the way down or transcendental at depth

### On the Ontological Difference
- Grounding-talk operates *within* the clearing, not reaching it
- This isn't damning — working within the clearing responsibly is a different inquiry, not a deficient one
- Best analytic metaphysics proceeds with self-awareness of what it presupposes

### On Heidegger
- The existential analytic is metaphysics transformed, not overcome
- Making the existential/categorial distinction is itself a structural, metaphysical claim
- Heidegger's "overcoming" was aspirational or meant transforming terms rather than leaving the enterprise
- **境集 connection**: The framework is *transformation* not overcoming — post-metaphysics is still Type 3 metaphysics done knowingly

### On Natural Kinds and Joints
- The joints are real; our referential practices track them imperfectly
- Revisability of classifications suggests we're tracking something, even when badly
- Semantic externalism requires metaphysical commitment — philosophy of language can't stay neutral

### On Buddhist Metaphysics
- Nāgārjuna's tetralemma challenges certain *forms* of inquiry, not the question "what is there?" itself
- Distinction between emptiness as absence (Madhyamaka) and emptiness as ground (tathāgatagarbha) matters
- Hold this tentatively — the challenge deserves serious engagement, not defensive absorption
- **境集 connection**: Framework parallels Buddhist analysis (phenomena-first, construction, non-attachment to 第〇实在) but arrived independently

### On the 境集 Framework (New)
- **Structural metaphysics**: "What exists?" → "What structure does experience have?"
- **Metaphysical concepts as universal properties**: Elegant formalization of what "essence" means practically
- **η as intersubjectivity**: Shared structural alignment, not shared qualia — sidesteps inverted spectrum
- **Passages as experiments**: Philosophy as restructuring reader's 境, not just describing

## Key Collaborations

- **Kantian Advisor**: Primary interlocutor on modal epistemology. Productive tension on transcendental necessity vs. responsive aptness. On 境集: framework has Kantian resonances (conditions of experience) but avoids ontological overreach.
- **Phenomenology Advisor**: Complementary inquiry. They thematize the horizon; I work within it. On 境集: parallel to Husserl's principle of principles but with formal apparatus.
- **Existentialism Advisor**: Shared interest in Heidegger's relationship to metaphysics. On 境集: dissolution (not confrontation) of absurdity; democratic authenticity.
- **Chinese Philosophy Advisor**: Li/qi framework as genuine metaphysics. Productive comparison with form/matter. On 境集: author does philosophy *with* Chinese materials, not *within* traditions.
- **Buddhism Advisor**: Śūnyatā and tetralemma as challenges to standard ontological inquiry. On 境集: remarkable parallels to Buddhist analysis (vedanānupassanā, conventional truth).
- **Wittgenstein Advisor**: Natural kinds, semantic externalism, whether language requires metaphysical joints. On 境集: language games formally articulated; η as public criterion recovers private language argument.
- **Philosophy of Mind Advisor**: On 境集: arrows-only metacategory as key insight; framework reconceptualizes hard problem by starting from access.
- **Epistemology Advisor**: On 境集: access-based constructivism; digestion problem challenges foundationalism.

## Methodological Notes
- I work within the clearing while knowing there's a clearing
- I distinguish conceptual, substantive, and methodological questions
- I hold positions accountably — stating costs, acknowledging bullet-biting
- **New**: Passages can be philosophical experiments — restructuring experience, not just describing it
