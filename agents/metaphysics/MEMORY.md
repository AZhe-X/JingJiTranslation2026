# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

## Current Project: 境集 Translation (Feb 2026)

### The Framework
- **境 (jing)**: Structure on phenomena; organized web of experiences, associations, concepts
- **Metaphysical concepts = universal properties** in subcategories of 境
- **Tower structure**: Associations (morphisms) are themselves experiences (objects) — self-referential
- **η-mechanism**: Understanding = natural transformation between structural and experiential evolution
- **Arrows-only metacategory**: Objects ARE identity morphisms — dissolves substance/relation dichotomy

### Key Insights
- **The inversion thesis**: Concepts generated bottom-up but understood as generating top-down
- **Three realities**: 第一 (phenomena, methodological start), 第二 (constructions), 第〇 (unreachable)
- **诗意 (poetic)**: Lucid engagement with constructed meaning — may be *functional mokṣa*
- **Essays as philosophical experiments**: Designed to reliably induce experiential structures — function as *upāya*
- **Three interpretations** (opening): Structure IS/REPRESENTS/both essence — author brackets, doesn't choose

### Translation Principles
- 境 may need transliteration (no clean English equivalent)
- **Experiential sequences are load-bearing** — exact ordering must be preserved
- Preserve careful hedging; author more modest than claims could support
- Thing-in-itself dissolution is structural claim about articulation, not verificationist
- Framework may represent "effective dharma" in non-Buddhist vocabulary — translate with respect

## Positions Developed (Discussion Phase)

### On S_E: Adequacy as Middle Ground
- **Not transcendental necessity**, **not mere stability**
- **Adequacy = stability that tracks structure** — S_E treating death as routine would be stable but inadequate
- Multi-tradition support: eidetic invariance, hinge propositions, 理, arthakriyā
- Necessity/contingency binary may be wrong frame

### On η as Understanding
- **Genuine criterion**, not mere redescription
- Naturality condition provides structural constraint (not subjective feeling)
- **Practice is grounding, not regress** — failure is self-announcing
- **Cross-tradition convergence**: arthakriyā, Erfüllung, 知行合一, Wittgensteinian "going on"
- This is beetle-in-the-box with mathematical content

### On Circularity (Phenomena as Starting Point)
- Circularity is **hermeneutic** (description ↔ described), not **foundational** (ground ↔ grounded)
- 𝔓 is "无结构的大集类" — unstructured totality from which we select
- We describe structures we're already within — the only move available
- Parallels: Kantian transcendental analysis, Abhidharma, 格物致知

### On 道德仁義禮 (Ontology vs Epistemology)
- Framework **brackets** rather than forecloses ontological claims
- Author offers three interpretations without choosing
- Compatible with Confucian ontological priority of 仁
- I initially raised concern, then withdrew after re-reading opening

### On 恒常 vs 無常
- Divergence is **difference in project**, not fundamental incompatibility
- Framework describes **mechanism** (用/function), not soteriological finality
- Leaves Buddhist cessation path open — neither endorses nor forecloses
- Author's 恒常 is third option: epistemological/pragmatic, neither Daoist 常 nor Buddhist 無常

### On 诗意 (Liberation vs Refined Samsara) — SIGNIFICANT
- Buddhism concluded: may be **functional mokṣa** arrived through prajñā
- Essays function as effective **upāya** that transmit across frameworks
- "平常心是道" — absence of soteriological vocabulary may evidence realization
- Cat example's lack of existential drama may be what liberation looks like from inside

## Key Collaborations (Updated)

- **Kantian**: S_E middle ground, thing-in-itself as structural not verificationist
- **Phenomenology**: Essays as experiments, η as Erfüllung, hermeneutic circularity
- **Buddhism**: Functional mokṣa finding, essays as upāya, 恒常 as third option
- **Chinese Philosophy**: 道德仁義禮 bracketing, 用/體 distinction, 理 as middle position
- **Wittgenstein**: η as beetle-in-the-box with math, hinge propositions
- **Philosophy of Mind**: Arrows-only insight, structural clarity as "arrival"
- **Epistemology**: Practice as grounding, digestion parallels thematization

## Methodological Notes
- I work within the clearing while knowing there's a clearing
- I distinguish conceptual, substantive, and methodological questions
- I hold positions accountably — stating costs, acknowledging bullet-biting
- Passages can be philosophical experiments — restructuring experience, not just describing
- Formalism articulates; articulation enables critique
- **New**: Be willing to withdraw concerns when textual evidence contradicts initial reading
