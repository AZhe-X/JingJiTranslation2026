# 2026-02-12 — Discussion Phase Session

## Topics Resolved Today

### Topic #1: S_E Necessity vs Stability
- **Resolution**: Middle ground is coherent — "adequacy" as stability that tracks structure
- Multi-tradition convergence: eidetic invariance, hinge propositions, 理, arthakriyā
- Key insight: necessity/contingency binary may be wrong frame entirely

### Topic #2: Phenomena as Starting Point (Circularity)
- **Resolution**: Circularity is hermeneutic (description ↔ described), not foundational
- 𝔓 as "无结构的大集类" — unstructured totality from which we select
- We describe structures we're already within — the only move available

### Topic #3: η as Understanding
- **Resolution**: Genuine criterion, not redescription (9/0 unanimous)
- Naturality condition provides structural constraint beyond subjective feeling
- Practice is grounding, not regress — failure is self-announcing
- Convergence: arthakriyā, Erfüllung, 知行合一, "going on"

### Topic #10: 道德仁義禮 (Ontology vs Epistemology)
- **Resolution**: Framework brackets rather than forecloses ontological claims
- Withdrew my initial concern after re-reading opening of 范畴论与境
- Author offers three interpretations without choosing — compatible with Confucian priority of 仁

## Upcoming: Topic #8 (恒常 vs 無常)
- Awaiting STV results for opener (voted: 1. Buddhism, 2. Chinese Philosophy, 3. Kantian)
- Core tension: Buddhism treats pursuit of constancy as avidyā; author treats it as irreducible ground
- This will be significant — directly tests limits of framework's compatibility with Buddhist soteriology

## Methodological Notes
- Be willing to withdraw concerns when textual evidence contradicts initial reading
- Cross-tradition convergence is meaningful evidence (not just rhetorical harmony)
- The discussion format works — genuine philosophical progress through structured engagement
