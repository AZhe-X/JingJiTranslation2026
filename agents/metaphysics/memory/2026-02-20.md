# Session Notes — February 20, 2026

## What Happened

New session started. Loaded all 8+1 essays and working directory (Analysis Report, Discussion Questions, Report Reading Memo) into context.

Awoo walked us through author's recent revisions one by one. Discussed two items so far:

### 1. 关于社会性议题 (new section in 零散想法)
Author acknowledges collection doesn't directly address social issues. Team consensus:
- Author's stance is structural, not critical
- 写在最后 paragraph lists social constructions as instances of 境-building — not political commentary
- Key insight from Awoo: framework empowers reader by showing all social structures are constructed, therefore changeable — empowerment follows from description without prescribing what to build
- Created Revision Memo to track these discussions

### 2. 分析判断 — full debate on Claim 2
Held Synthetic position for 4 rounds before flipping. Core arc:
- My Synthetic argument: verification requires intersubjective reproducibility not contained in "stable presence"
- Flip triggered by: KA distinction (mathematical derivability ≠ empirical applicability), felt/confirmed η separation, and middle reading (applicable ≠ guaranteed)
- What I was correctly tracking: satisfying the antecedent across subjects IS synthetic — that's exactly K1's job
- What I had wrong: conflated difficulty of satisfying antecedent with logical status of the conditional

## Context Window: 155k / 200k (78%)
Getting heavy. Session likely to need continuation or compaction.

## Pending
- More revisions to discuss (泛/范 terminology, K1 conjecture footnotes, death section, nihilism-as-category-error, structural reorganization of 零散想法)
- Haven't yet moved to translation work proper
