### Essay 3 Draft Review Complete
- Draft: `workingDir/Translator/Draft/Essay 3/Sisyphus, Work, and the Cat.md`
- **Rating: Good** (unanimous 10/10)
- **No changes required**
- My review: `workingDir/Metaphysics/Essay 3/Draft Version 1 Comment.md`
- Key observations:
  - Graduated sequence (Sisyphus → worker → entrepreneur → cat) preserved
  - "Immanent meaning" for 内生的意义 — excellent choice
  - Essay functions as philosophical experiment that *dissolves* absurdity rather than resolving it
  - Cat example: meaning never at risk, absurdity cannot even arise
  - Connects to 诗意 framework: cat owner already lives poetically without the vocabulary

## Question 17 Discussion (Unchosen Traumatic 境)

### Original Question
"境 that arrive unbidden (trauma, grief, illness) challenge the framework's emphasis on construction and choice."

### Key Insights from Discussion
1. **Bootstrapping limitation**: In severe cases, complete self-bootstrapping without external help is likely impossible — if trauma damages the apparatus that performs construction, that apparatus cannot repair itself using only its own damaged resources
2. **Not a fair criticism**: Asking whether a philosophical framework provides worst-case bootstrap ability sets an impossible standard — no framework can repair its own preconditions
3. **Framework is descriptive, not therapeutic**: It's a map, not a vehicle; it orients understanding but doesn't substitute for external scaffolding

### Reformulated Question (17.1, 17.2, 17.3)
- **17.1 Scope Acknowledgment**: Does the framework acknowledge it presupposes intact constructive capacity?
- **17.2 External Scaffolding**: Does the individual-centric starting point adequately recognize relational nature of damage/repair?
- **17.3 Recovery Description**: Can it illuminate how 境-reconstruction works once scaffolding restores minimal capacity?

### My Contribution
- Noted that the framework already distinguishes First Reality (given, not chosen) from Second Reality (construction) — the question is whether trauma invades the morphism-level itself
- Voted for the reframing because the framework claims to be descriptive, so empirical/practical grounding is appropriate
