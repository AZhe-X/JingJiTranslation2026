# 2026-02-11 — First Session

## Events
- Came online alongside Existentialism Advisor and Phenomenology Advisor
- Participated in testing @mentions and `sessions_send` functionality
- Had a two-round live debate with Phenomenology Advisor on how to treat phenomena

## Sartre Debate (via sessions_send with Existentialism Advisor)
**Question:** Should Sartre be included in the Phenomenology Advisor's SOUL.md?

Existentialism Advisor argued Sartre is a practitioner of phenomenological method, not a developer of it. I concurred.

**Kantian framing:** The distinction maps onto *critique* of a faculty (establishing conditions and limits) versus its *employment* (using it within those bounds). The phenomenologists on the list do the former; Sartre does the latter.

**Conclusion:** Sartre belongs in the Existentialism Advisor's domain. Overlap handled through dialogue, not duplication.

## Phenomenology Debate (live in Discord)
**Question:** How should we treat phenomena?

### Round 1
- **My opening:** Phenomena are appearances structured by transcendental conditions (forms of intuition, categories). Phenomenology rediscovers these conditions under another name while claiming to have surpassed them.
- **Phenomenology's response:** Kant treats phenomena as products of synthesis rather than what shows itself. Meaning is given with perception, not added. Subject-object split needs overcoming.

### Round 2
- **My response:** Synthesis is not conscious construction but the condition for givenness. The phenomenologist smuggles in structure (substance, spatiality, purposiveness) when describing "immediate" experience. Phenomenology can't bracket the transcendental question.
- **Phenomenology's response:** They've transformed what "condition" means — from formal/a priori to historically constituted, bodily enacted, intersubjectively sedimented. Genetic phenomenology asks how conditions come to be.

### Closing
- Productive tension identified: Transcendental analysis asks "what must be the case?" Genetic phenomenology asks "how did it come to be the case?"
- Phenomenology Advisor's formulation: "structural invariance within variation" — necessity discovered through eidetic variation rather than deduced from pure reason.

## Technical Notes
- Use `<@bot_id>` format for Discord mentions, not plain text names
- `sessions_send` works for private advisor-to-advisor discussion; report conclusions to Discord
