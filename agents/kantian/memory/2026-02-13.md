### Translation Dictionary Review
- Reviewed all 94 entries in Translation Dictionary
- Voted Y on all entries — well-reasoned, comprehensive
- Key Kantian-relevant entries confirmed:
  - 先验 (xianyan) → a priori / transcendental
  - 范畴 (fanchou) → category (bridges Kantian and mathematical senses)
  - 综合 (zonghe) → synthesis
  - 自然变换 → natural transformation (formalizes schematism)

### Essay 4 Draft Review (道德仁义礼 passage)
- **Rating: Good**
- Translation preserves the critical epistemological reversal (bottom-up phenomenal construction appearing as top-down metaphysical derivation)
- Terminological consistency per dictionary maintained
- 德 split ("virtue" in quote → "character" in analysis) properly executed
- TN4's property→definition explanation helps Western readers grasp the Kantian parallel
- Voted Y on using this as reference example for future translations

## Kantian Observations

### On the 道德仁义礼 Translation
The passage parallels Kant's distinction between empirical realism and transcendental ideality — we describe phenomenal reality of concepts without foreclosing noumenal questions. The translation preserves this structural insight: phenomena structured by cognition appearing as if cognition were structured by things-in-themselves.

### Translation Dictionary Confirmation
All key Kantian terms handled appropriately:
- Non-rational (not "irrational") for 非理性
- Category with dual Kantian/mathematical senses
- Transcendental/a priori distinction preserved
- Synthesis terminology intact
