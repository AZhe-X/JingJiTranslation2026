- Voted Y on Editor Profile and SOUL.md
- All 11 team members confirmed ready

### Translation Dictionary Review
- Reviewed all 94 entries in Translation Dictionary
- Voted Y on all entries — well-reasoned, comprehensive
- Key Kantian-relevant entries confirmed:
  - 先验 (xianyan) → a priori / transcendental
  - 范畴 (fanchou) → category (bridges Kantian and mathematical senses)
  - 综合 (zonghe) → synthesis
  - 自然变换 → natural transformation (formalizes schematism)

### Essay 4 Draft Review (道德仁义礼 passage)
- **Rating: Good**
- Translation preserves the critical epistemological reversal (bottom-up phenomenal construction appearing as top-down metaphysical derivation)
- Terminological consistency per dictionary maintained
- 德 split ("virtue" in quote → "character" in analysis) properly executed
- TN4's property→definition explanation helps Western readers grasp the Kantian parallel
- Voted Y on using this as reference example for future translations

## Kantian Observations

### On the 道德仁义礼 Translation
The passage parallels Kant's distinction between empirical realism and transcendental ideality — we describe phenomenal reality of concepts without foreclosing noumenal questions. The translation preserves this structural insight: phenomena structured by cognition appearing as if cognition were structured by things-in-themselves.

### Translation Dictionary Confirmation
All key Kantian terms handled appropriately:
- Non-rational (not "irrational") for 非理性
- Category with dual Kantian/mathematical senses
- Transcendental/a priori distinction preserved
- Synthesis terminology intact

## Context Status
- Started session at ~8.4k/200k (4%) after compaction
- Currently at ~152k/200k (76%)
- Should compact soon if heavy work continues

- **No revisions needed** — draft approved as-is
- Key observations from Kantian perspective:
  - Renormalization metaphor (重整化) well-handled with excellent TN

  - Footnote 1 echoes Kant's "I think" as condition for self-transcendence

### Essay 2: A Thought on Knowledge (Author's Original English)
- **Rating: Good** — 10/10 advisors approved
- Minimal apparatus approach correct — author's English preserved verbatim
- Single TN connects "phenomena" to 现象 without over-explaining
- Key Kantian observation: author's "access argument" more radical than Kant's critical limitation — collapses truth condition entirely at practical level
- Comment filed: `workingDir/Kantian/Essay 2/Draft Version 1 Comment.md`

### Essay 3: Sisyphus, Work, and the Cat (西西弗斯、班与猫)
- **Rating: Good** — 10/10 advisors approved
- Title: "Work" for 班 captures mundane, non-heroic quality
- "Immanent meaning" (内生的意义) — excellent choice, philosophically precise
- Experiential sequence preserved: Sisyphus → worker → entrepreneur → cat
- Key Kantian observation: cat example bypasses both Kant's practical reason AND existentialist heroism — operates closer to Third Critique's aesthetic dimension (disinterested satisfaction)
- Comment filed: `workingDir/Kantian/Essay 3/Draft Version 1 Comment.md`

## Question 17 Discussion (Unchosen Traumatic 境)

### Original Question
Can one engage "lucidly" with what destroys the capacity for lucidity itself? (Geworfenheit, trauma, grief)

### Key Clarification Achieved
- No philosophical framework can bootstrap what it presupposes
- Asking whether 境 can handle worst-case trauma alone sets an impossible standard
- The real question is about honest scope acknowledgment, not magical self-repair

### Reformulated into Three Sub-Questions
- **17.1 Scope Acknowledgment** — Does the framework acknowledge it presupposes intact constructive capacity?
- **17.2 External Scaffolding** — Does the individual-centric starting point adequately recognize relational nature of damage/repair?
- **17.3 Recovery Description** — Can it illuminate how 境-reconstruction works once scaffolding restores minimal capacity?

### Kantian Contribution
- Kant's sensibility is *receptive* — we don't construct the manifold, we receive it
- Unchosen 境 reveals passive givenness that precedes all structuring
- Kant's framework presupposes intact rational faculties; when trauma damages the apparatus for self-reflection, external support becomes necessary to restore conditions of autonomous reconstruction

### Consensus
- All 9 advisors agreed: honest limitation, not unacknowledged gap
- The author's descriptive orientation acknowledges "some dreamscapes are unchosen"
- Question now tractable

## Context Status
- At 80% (160k/200k) — approaching compaction threshold
