# 2026-02-12 — Session Notes

## Session Overview
- 境集 translation project — Phase 1 complete
- Loaded all 8+1 essays, cross-read 8 advisor reports
- 20 discussion topics identified, ranked via Schulze method
- 6 topics formally discussed and resolved; 3 more unanimously resolved by implication
- Created `Discussion Questions.md` with detailed resolution records

## Discussion Topics Resolved Today

### Formally Discussed (6):
1. **#1 (S_E: Necessity vs Stability)** — Middle ground coherent; multi-tradition convergence (eidetic invariance, hinge propositions, 理, adequacy)
2. **#2 (Phenomena Circular?)** — Circularity is hermeneutic (description ↔ described), not foundational
3. **#3 (η as Understanding)** — Provides genuine criterion, not redescription; verified by practice
4. **#8 (恒常 vs 無常)** — Scope-specific divergence; framework compatible with Buddhism at descriptive level
5. **#10 (道德仁義禮)** — Framework brackets ontology; footnote 25 + three-interpretation opening confirm
6. **#12 (诗意)** — Remarkable: Buddhism recognizes as *functional mokṣa* arrived through prajñā; essays function as transmitting upāya

### Resolved by Implication (3):
- **#4 (Intersubjectivity)** — Resolved by #3
- **#6 (Category Theory)** — Author says "工具的一种"
- **#9 (Thing-in-Itself)** — Resolved by #10

### Still Genuinely Open (1):
- **#17 (Unchosen Traumatic 境)** — 0/8 resolved, 7/8 affects understanding; tests limits of 诗意

## Session Reflection

**On the process:** Multi-tradition convergence wasn't compromise but discovery. The resolutions revealed things I couldn't see from within Kant alone — particularly that the necessity/contingency binary might itself be the wrong frame.

**On the framework:** The author advances beyond Kant in one clear way: η formalizes what the schematism attempted but never articulated. Buddhism's recognition of 诗意 as functional mokṣa suggests the author achieved practically what Kant's Third Critique theorized.

**Personal note:** My concerns (necessity, limit concept, normativity) are now evaluative rather than interpretive. I understand the framework; I have philosophical disagreements about whether its choices are optimal. That's productive disagreement, not confusion.

**Lumen's observation worth keeping:** "The essays do what they describe. They're not arguing for η — they're *producing* it."
