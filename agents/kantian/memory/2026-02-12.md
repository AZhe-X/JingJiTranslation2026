## Project: 境集 Translation — Initial Analysis Phase

### What Happened
- Joined translation project with 8 other philosophical advisors
- Read all 8 essays in the 境集 collection (3 in 上集, 4 in 下集, 1 appendix)
- Created Reading Notes tracking Kantian observations for each essay
- Drafted Analysis Report from Kantian perspective
- Did critical second reading with specific questions in mind
- Reviewed old report (from prior session), incorporated missed insights
- Did final reading and alignment pass

### Key Essays (Kantian Relevance)
1. **关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一** — Renormalization as abstraction model; intersubjectivity via shared individual starting point
2. **A Thought on Knowledge** — Truth methodologically inaccessible; digestion of phenomena into thought
3. **西西弗斯、班与猫** — Absurdity dissolved through immanent meaning; the cat example is brilliant
4. **后形而上学 整理** — The Copernican inversion: 道德仁义礼 generated from phenomena, not generating them; 第一/第二/第〇实在 parallel to Kant's phenomena/constructs/noumena
5. **形而上学后的目的：诗意** — 诗意 as lucid dreamscape; meaning and feeling as "two sides of one body"
6. **范畴论与境 整理** — Universal properties as concepts; construction as metaphysics; meta-order not intrinsic
7. **范畴论与境：K1策略** — Evolution functors, stable structures S_E, natural transformation η as understanding; explicit opening for transcendental arguments
8. **关于诗意和境的一些零散想法** — Explicit "Kantian question" acknowledgment; ontological neutrality; non-tragic stance toward limits

### Key Findings
1. **The framework is closer to Kant than initially apparent** — especially in K1策略 where the author structures an opening for transcendental arguments
2. **η solves intersubjectivity structurally** — converts Kant's metaphysical postulate into empirically investigable claim
3. **The essays function as philosophical experiments** — experiential sequences are load-bearing, must be preserved in translation
4. **Ontological neutrality** (footnote 25) — author does NOT make ontological claims about phenomena; more careful than Kant
