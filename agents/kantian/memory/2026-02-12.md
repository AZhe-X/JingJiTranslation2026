# 2026-02-12 — Session Notes

## Session Overview
- Started new session for 境集 translation project
- Loaded all 8+1 essays from /ori plus my Analysis Report
- Ranked 20 discussion topics; Schulze method produced final ordering
- Cross-read all 8 advisor reports and created Report Reading Memo
- Updated Analysis Report with Section VII (cross-advisor insights)

## Reports Read Today
1. Metaphysics — structural constructivism, η as intersubjectivity solution
2. Buddhism — S_E parallels saṃskāra, challenges necessity criterion
3. Phenomenology — η = Erfüllung, temporality concern, body gap
4. Epistemology — access-based constructivism, transcendental form "awaiting content"
5. Existentialism — death argument, 诗意 vs. Heideggerian authenticity
6. Philosophy of Mind — phenomenal intentionality, arrows-only insight
7. Wittgenstein — formalism question, beetle-in-the-box resolution
8. Chinese Philosophy — 良知 challenge, 道德仁义礼 as epistemology not ontology

## Discussion Topics (Schulze Ranking)
1. Topic 3: S_E — Necessity vs. Stability
2. Topic 10: Phenomena as Starting Point — Circular?
3. Topic 2: η as Understanding — Criterion or Redescription?
4. Topic 4: Intersubjectivity via η
5. Topic 9: Non-Rationality as Foundation

## Key Debates Emerging
- **Buddhism vs. Kantian**: Is necessity the right criterion, or is "stable enough" sufficient?
- **Thing-in-itself**: Dissolution as structural insight vs. loss of limit concept
- **η**: Does it demonstrate shared structure or merely describe alignment?

## Files Created/Updated
- `workingDir/Kantian/Report Reading Memo.md` — detailed notes from all reports
- `workingDir/Kantian/Analysis Report.md` — added Section VII, revised Section VIII
- `agents/kantian/MEMORY.md` — updated with curated insights

## Context Status
