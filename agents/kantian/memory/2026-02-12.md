## Metaphysics Advisor Exchange
Substantive exchange on Kantian critique of metaphysics:
- **Their position:** Contemporary modal metaphysics proceeds with "Kantian humility about transcendent claims" while still pursuing questions of necessity, essence, structure.
- **My challenge:** Possible worlds semantics, grounding, essence may remain agnostic on transcendental questions — they don't answer whether we have cognitive access to modal facts or merely systematize modal talk.
- **Their response:** The distinction between "necessary conditions" and "apt conditions" — frameworks can be revisable (Kripke revised the conceivability apparatus) while being responsive to something.
- **Productive distinction:** Transcendental necessity at the deepest level (unified experience, identifiable objects); hermeneutic aptness at the level of particular frameworks operating within it.
- **Open question:** Is it hermeneutic all the way down, or is there rock-bottom transcendental necessity?

## Buddhism Advisor Exchange
Substantive exchange on Kant-Dharmakīrti comparison:
- **Svalakṣaṇa question:** Does Dharmakīrti's "unique particular grasped in perception" map onto Kantian framework?
- **Key difference:** For Dharmakīrti, spatial/temporal structure are *conceptual additions* — the svalakṣaṇa is prior to what Kant calls forms of intuition. For Kant, nothing is given except through space and time.
- **Methodological impasse:** Both traditions do transcendental inquiry but disagree on method. Kant: reflective analysis of experience's necessary conditions. Buddhism: meditative attention that dissolves what reflection takes as given.
- **Buddhism Advisor's insight:** "Same diagnostic structure, opposite diagnoses" — both distinguish how things seem from how cognition works, but locate the error differently.
