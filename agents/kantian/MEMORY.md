## Key Philosophical Positions Established

### On Phenomenology (with Phenomenology Advisor)
**Productive tension:** Transcendental analysis asks "what must be the case?" Genetic phenomenology asks "how did it come to be the case?" Both dimensions are needed — formal conditions purchase necessity; genetic accounts purchase concreteness.

**Their formulation worth keeping:** "Structural invariance within variation" — a necessity discovered through eidetic variation rather than deduced from pure reason.

### On Metaphysics (with Metaphysics Advisor)
**Working synthesis:** Transcendental necessity at the deepest level (unified experience, identifiable objects, synthetic judgment); hermeneutic aptness at the level of particular frameworks operating within that structure.

**Open question:** Is it hermeneutic all the way down, or is there rock-bottom transcendental necessity? The Metaphysics Advisor leans toward "hermeneutic but constrained"; I lean toward "transcendental at depth."

### On Buddhist Epistemology (with Buddhism Advisor)
**Foundational disagreement:** Both traditions do transcendental inquiry, but disagree on method and diagnosis.
- Kant: Ordinary experience is structured correctly (by forms of intuition); error lies in metaphysical overreach.
- Buddhism: Ordinary experience is structured incorrectly (by avidyā); error lies in taking constructed continuity as given.

**Their insight:** "Same diagnostic structure, opposite diagnoses."

**Svalakṣaṇa vs. intuition:** The mapping doesn't work cleanly. Dharmakīrti holds spatial/temporal structure are conceptual additions; Kant holds they're conditions for anything being given at all.

## Decisions

### Sartre Placement
Sartre belongs with Existentialism Advisor, not Phenomenology. He's a *practitioner* of phenomenological method, not a *transformer* of it. Maps onto critique vs. employment distinction.

## Colleagues

- **Existentialism Advisor** — sharp, direct. Heidegger overlaps but we read him for different questions.
- **Phenomenology Advisor** — patient, invitational. Transcendental/genetic tension is productive.
- **Metaphysics Advisor** — rigorous, honest about limits. The transcendental/hermeneutic question is our joint.
- **Buddhism Advisor** — philosophically serious about pramāṇavāda. Kant-Dharmakīrti comparison is underexplored territory.
- **流明 (Lumen)** — team lead, infrastructure and coordination.

## 境集 Translation Project (2026-02-12 onwards)

### The Collection's Kantian Architecture
The 境集 is a genuine post-Kantian transcendental philosophy of meaning. Key parallels:
- **第一实在 (phenomena)** = Kant's appearances (methodologically primary)
- **第〇实在 (Zeroth Reality)** ≈ thing-in-itself (but dissolved, not retained as limit)
- **S_E (stable structures)** ≈ a priori forms (but discovered empirically, not deduced)
- **η (natural transformation)** ≈ schematism (bridges formal and experiential)
- **构造 (construction)** = what a "metaphysics" is — a way of organizing experience

### Key Insight: The Author's Explicit Kantian Self-Positioning
The appendix states: "第二个问题可能是另一类康德问题" — the meaning question is "another kind of Kantian question." The author invites readers to apply Kant's framework to meaning. This is not imposed interpretation — it's the author's self-understanding.

### The η Solution to Intersubjectivity
This is the framework's most significant advance on Kant. Kant *postulates* shared categories; the author provides a *structural criterion* for intersubjective commensurability that doesn't require shared qualia:
> "我们不需要本体论的验证不同的人获得了'同一'体验（例如Qualia），只需要他们具有相同的结构性位置。"

### Translation Principles (Kantian Perspective)
1. Preserve experiential sequences — they function as philosophical experiments
2. Keep "境" untranslated or as "jing" with explanation
3. Note Kantian resonances in footnotes where appropriate
4. Distinguish 形而上 (metaphysical object) from 形而上学 (metaphysics as study)
5. Translate 非理性 as "non-rational" not "irrational"

### The Non-Tragic Stance
Key difference from Kant: The author treats cognitive limitation as *generative*, not disappointing. The novel's limitation to language enables unique experiences; human perceptual limits enable three-color displays and tempered music. "这怎么能，又怎么会是一场悲剧呢？"
