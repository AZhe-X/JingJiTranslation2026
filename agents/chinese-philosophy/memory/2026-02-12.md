## My Analysis Report
- Located: `workingDir/Chinese Philosophy/Analysis Report.md`
- Section 15 added: Cross-Reading Insights
- Key revisions: 
  - 道德仁义礼 less provocative than initially assessed
  - 恒常 as third option (epistemological/pragmatic)
  - Relational approach more congenial to Chinese thought

## Discussion Topics I'm Prioritized For
From Schulze method ranking:
- Topic 7: 恒常 vs 無常 (with Buddhism)
- Topic 14: 道德仁义礼 Inversion (with Kantian, Metaphysics)
- Topic 15: Neo-Confucian Lacuna (with Kantian, Epistemology)
- Topic 6: 诗意 vs Liberation (with Buddhism, Existentialism)

## Key Questions to Press
1. Is 恒常 genuinely novel or does it collapse into existing positions?
2. Does the framework have resources to address 良知's claimed immediacy?
3. Where is 道統/傳承 in this synchronic framework?
