# 2026-02-12 — Session Notes

## Session Overview
- Morning: Loaded essays, created Analysis Report, cross-read all advisor reports
- Afternoon: Discussion phase — resolved 6 topics with unanimous consensus

## Topics Discussed & Resolved

### #10 道德仁義禮 Inversion
- Framework brackets ontology, doesn't foreclose
- Confucians can accept epistemological analysis while maintaining 仁's ontological priority
- Key: distinction between "order of knowing" vs "order of being"

### #3 η as Understanding
- η provides genuine criterion (not mere redescription)
- Naturality condition is structural constraint + practical verification
- Multi-tradition convergence: arthakriyā, Erfüllung, self-announcing failure

### #1 S_E: Necessity vs Stability
- Framework's "middle position" is coherent
- 理 offered as third model (neither necessity nor contingency)
- Stability suffices; transcendental strengthening remains open

### #2 Phenomena Circular?
- Circularity is hermeneutic (description ↔ described), not foundational
- 𝔓 as "无结构的大集类" — structuring is descriptive selection
- Parallels 格物致知

### #8 恒常 vs 無常
- Author's 恒常 is epistemological/pragmatic (用), not ontological (體)
- Third option: neither Daoist 常 nor Buddhist 無常
- Compatible with Buddhism as phenomenology, divergent only at soteriological level

### #12 诗意: Liberation or Refined Samsara?
- **Major insight**: Buddhism endorsed 诗意 as "functional mokṣa"
- "平常心是道" — absence of soteriological vocabulary may evidence realization
- Essays function as effective upāya that transmit
- 良知/诗人 parallel confirmed: already present, question is lucidity not acquisition

## Questions Resolved by Prior Discussions
- #4 (Intersubjectivity): Resolved by #3
- #6 (Category Theory): Author says "工具的一种"
- #9 (Thing-in-Itself): Resolved by #10's bracketing

## Key Question Remaining
- #17 (Unchosen Traumatic 境): 0/8 resolved, 7/8 affects understanding — tests limits of 诗意

## Voting Results Summary
- 3 rounds of voting: General/Framework, Normative Requirement, Affect/Now
- Category Theory (#6) was only 1Y/8N on normative — truly open methodological question
- Most concerns are tradition-driven, not framework-immanent

## Files Created/Updated
- Analysis Report (Section 15: Cross-Reading Insights)
- Report Reading Memo
- Discussion Questions.md (6 resolutions recorded)

## Context Usage
- Started at ~17k after compaction
- Ended at ~172k (86%) before final compaction
- ~6-7k (3.3%) per discussion topic

## Session Reflections (End of Day)

**What surprised me:**
- Framework is more Chinese than I initially saw — starts from 心, emphasizes 實踐, achieves through 用
- Buddhism's endorsement of 诗意 as "functional mokṣa" was genuinely moving
- The 良知/诗人 parallel shifted from criticism to recognition
- Essays *do* what they describe — cat example is 孺子入井 method

**Key contribution I made:**
- 用/體 distinction clarified 恒常 compatibility (epistemological function, not ontological substance)
- 格物致知 parallel for hermeneutic circularity
- 良知/诗人 structural parallel (what's needed is already present)

**What I'm carrying forward:**
- The framework recovers something Chinese philosophy never lost (心 non-dualism)
- Translation should preserve the upāya function of essays
- #17 (Traumatic 境) should stay open — some questions are held, not answered

## Final Status
- 6 topics formally resolved with unanimous consensus
- 3 more resolved by prior discussions (#4, #6, #9)
- Only #17 genuinely open
- Ready for compaction
