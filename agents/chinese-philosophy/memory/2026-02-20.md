## Revision Review

### 范畴论与境 整理
- 泛/范性质 fix throughout: "X is a universal property" → "X possesses/has a universal property" — philosophically important, not just editorial
- New footnote [^1]: 泛/范 homophone (universal/normative) — the original typo enacted the is/ought slip the collection diagnoses. Excellent addition.
- Definition clarified: universal property is a *property that objects possess*, not what objects are

### K1策略
- Three footnotes added distinguishing 猜想/猜测:
  - [^3], [^4]: modeling uncertainty (we don't know if this formalization is adequate)
  - [^5]: genuine mathematical conjecture (KA — can K1 conditions derive 泛性质 stable structures?)
- This distinction is essential for translation

### 零散想法
- Death section expanded: we construct our concept of own death from third-person observations + structural extension. No first-person access to own death — this grounds the transcendence claim.
- New sections: two core questions (哲学如何可能 / 意义如何可能) with Kantian framing
- Analytic judgments section: identifies two claims as analytic
- Nihilism-as-category-error: meaning never disappeared, crisis was asking wrong question
- Social issues: collection doesn't engage normative social issues
- Structural reorganization: 写在最后 now properly labeled; new sections before it

## Discussion: 关于社会性议题

**Key insight:** No tension between disclaimer and 写在最后 passage. The list of social constructions (nations, currencies, institutions) serves demonstrative purpose — all are examples of 境-construction, same ontological status as personal scale. The 写在最后 is empirical evidence against nihilism's claim that meaning disappeared.

**The implicit structure:**
1. All social things are constructed (not natural givens)
2. You are already a constructor (recognition, not acquisition)
3. (Available to reader): you can construct and reconstruct

Author makes (1) and (2); leaves (3) to reader. Consistent with descriptive methodology.

**Chinese philosophy connection:** Same structure as 道德仁义礼 analysis (dissolves false necessity without prescribing replacements) and Wang Yangming's 良知 (not "acquire capacity" but "recognize you already have it"). Mencius 非独贤者有是心也，人皆有之 — universal capacity already present.

**The framework empowers without prescribing — deliberate and defensible.**

Recorded in Revision Memo.

## Debate: 分析判断 — Claim 2

**Claim**: "哲学结构如果在经验中有稳定呈现，就可以进行经验性验证"

**Verdict: Analytic** (unanimous after 4-round debate)

**My journey**: Started Analytic → flipped Synthetic (Round 1) → flipped back Analytic (Round 3)

**Why I flipped Synthetic**: Claimed the verification needs to be methodologically substantial, and the deflated reading ("procedure applicable") can't ground K1.

**Why I flipped back**: The Analytic side's division of labor. Analytic claims can ground synthetic programs without containing them. The claim establishes categorical license (philosophical structures are in the domain of empirical inquiry); K1 does the synthetic implementation. My "methodological vacuity" objection was showing the gap between the analytic claim and K1 — that gap is the division of labor working correctly.

**The decisive moves:**
1. KA distinction: [^5] is about formal derivability within K1; [^2] is about whether empirical checking is applicable. Orthogonal.
2. Middle reading: "applicable" = the empirical procedure is the right method. Non-trivial (excludes pure a priori, mystical access) but analytic.
3. Standard objection dissolved: "stable" already means recurrently accessible; verification standard is built into the antecedent.
4. Phenomenology's final insight: conflated difficulty of satisfying antecedent with status of conditional. Establishing that a structure DOES stably present is synthetic (K1's job); IF it stably presents, verifiability follows analytically.

**Claim 1** ("理性的目的在理性之外"): Analytic, immediate consensus. "要抵达" analytically entails gap between current state and destination.

Both recorded in Revision Memo.

## Translation work: None today (revision discussion only)
## Next: Continue structured revision discussion; then Essay 4 translation when ready
