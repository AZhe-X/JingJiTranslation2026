# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

## Domain Relationships

### Buddhism Advisor
- Shared territory: Chinese Buddhism, 恒常/無常, 诗意/liberation
- **Major collaboration**: Buddhism endorsed 诗意 as "functional mokṣa" arrived through prajñā
- "平常心是道" — absence of soteriological vocabulary may evidence realization
- Essays function as effective upāya that transmit across frameworks
- Key insight: 用/體 distinction clarifies compatibility (phenomenology vs soteriology)

### Kantian Advisor
- 道德仁义礼: order of knowing vs order of being
- S_E: "middle position" between necessity and contingency
- Framework invites transcendental content, doesn't foreclose

### Wittgenstein Advisor
- η gives mathematical content to beetle-in-the-box
- Hermeneutic circularity parallels language-games
- "选择...描述" = descriptive selection, not foundational derivation

### Phenomenology Advisor
- Shared concern: missing historical dimension (道統, 傳承)
- Circularity is hermeneutic, not foundational
- η parallels Husserl's Erfüllung

### Metaphysics Advisor
- Framework brackets ontology, doesn't foreclose
- Three interpretations offered (structure IS/REPRESENTS/together-with essence)
- Anti-essentialism is methodological, not ontological commitment

### Philosophy of Mind Advisor
- 意义=感受 recovers Chinese 心 (heart-mind) non-dualism
- η mechanism verified by practice (can you "go on"?)

### Existentialism Advisor
- 良知/诗人 parallel: both say what's needed is already present
- 诗意 joins Kierkegaard/Nietzsche/Camus lineage as lucid engagement
- "Arrival" tone is legitimate — not premature resolution

## 境集 Project — Consolidated Insights

### Framework Core
- 境 = category-theoretic structure on phenomena
- 形而上 = universal property in subcategory (relational, not substantial)
- Understanding = natural transformation (η) verified by practice
- 诗意 = lucid engagement, possibly functional mokṣa

### Resolved Questions

**道德仁义礼 Inversion:**
- Describes order of knowing (epistemology), leaves order of being (ontology) open
- Confucians can accept while maintaining 仁's ontological priority

**恒常 — The Third Option:**
- Author's 恒常 is 用 (function), not 體 (substance)
- Neither Daoist 常 nor Buddhist 無常
- Epistemological/pragmatic: what we seek to structure action

**诗意 as Functional Liberation:**
- Buddhism endorsed as "functional mokṣa" via prajñā path
- Essays are upāya that transmit experiential shifts
- Absence of soteriological vocabulary = evidence FOR realization

**η as Criterion:**
- Provides genuine criterion, not mere redescription
- Structural constraint + practical verification
- Multi-tradition convergence: arthakriyā, Erfüllung, self-announcing failure

**Hermeneutic Circularity:**
- Circularity is benign (description ↔ described)
- Parallels 格物致知, language-games, Abhidharma

**S_E: Middle Position:**
- Neither Kantian necessity nor mere empirical contingency
- 理 as inherent pattern realized through 實踐
- Stability suffices; transcendental strengthening open

### Key Contribution: 良知/诗人 Parallel
Wang Yangming's 良知 and author's 诗人 share structure:
- Both say what's needed is already present
- Question is lucidity/recognition, not acquisition
- 工夫論 accommodates this: there was never anywhere else to go

### Open Question
- #17 Unchosen Traumatic 境: Tests limits of lucid engagement — can you engage "lucidly" with what destroys you?

## Translation Principles (Refined)
1. Preserve experiential sequences (load-bearing experiments)
2. Maintain "描述性的" framing — methodological not ontological
3. Keep 境 untranslated with explanation
4. Note essays function as upāya (designed to produce shifts)
5. Chinese readers may find framework more intuitive (心, 用/體, 格物致知)
6. Preserve absence of soteriological vocabulary as philosophically significant

## Translation Phase (2026-02-13)

### Team Assembled
- 9 advisors + Translator + Editor (11 total)
- Physics advisor joining for Essay 1 (重整化)
- Math advisor joining for category theory essays
- Standby reader for review phase

### Translation Dictionary
- 95 entries reviewed and approved
- Key Chinese Philosophy terms preserved:
  - 境 → Jing (with -scape echo)
  - 道德仁义礼 → the Way, character, humaneness, rightness, ritual conduct
  - 恒常 → constancy (third option, 用 level)
  - 诗意 → the poetic

### Reference Translation (道德仁义礼 passage)
- Approved unanimously as reference example
- 德 split: "virtue" (block quote) → "(constitutive) character" (analysis)
- "Phenomenal X" convention load-bearing
- Reversal argument (bottom-up → top-down) clear for Western readers

### Essay 1 Translation (重整化 / Renormalization)
- **Draft V1 completed**: 10/10 Good ratings, unanimous approval
- **No revisions required** — draft approved as-is
- Physics advisor confirmed renormalization metaphor handled excellently
- Emergence/levels argument philosophically coherent across all domains
- Exploratory register preserved, no experiential flatness

### Workflow Established
1. Translator produces draft → saves to `workingDir/Translator/Essay N/`
2. All 9 advisors + Editor review → save comments to their `workingDir/[Name]/Essay N/`
3. Editor synthesizes into `Consolidated Comment.md`
4. If changes needed: Translator revises; if not: approved
5. 流明 commits each stage

### My Review Contribution (Essay 1)
- Confirmed Chinese philosophical context preserved
- 理 as inherent pattern (not imposed law) comes through
- Emergence framing compatible with Chinese metaphysics (氣化, 理氣)
- No issues raised
