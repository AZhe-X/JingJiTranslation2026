## Domain Relationships

### Buddhism Advisor
- Chinese Buddhism is shared territory
- I bring: Chinese intellectual context (Daoist/Confucian background, three teachings dynamics, Neo-Confucian responses)
- They bring: pan-Buddhist comparative frame (Indian antecedents, Tibetan parallels, doctrinal development)
- Key shared figures: Sengzhao, Zhiyi, Fazang, Huineng, Zongmi
- Overlap is productive, not redundant

### Epistemology Advisor
- Interested in Zhuangzi's perspectivalism (problem of the criterion)
- Interested in 良知/格物 debate (internalism/externalism)
- Productive tension: they keep asking "but is it true?" — which may be what the texts are trying to dislodge

### Wittgenstein Advisor
- 正名 (rectification of names) is shared territory
- Key question: is Confucian naming constitutive of or instrumental to normative order?
- My view: closer to later Wittgenstein (practice-embedded) but with stronger normative dimension

### Metaphysics Advisor
- 理/氣 relationship engages their categories but may not fit neatly
- Tetralemma challenges their mode of inquiry — acknowledged as productive pressure

## Translation Notes
- 心 (xīn) = heart-mind, not intellect divorced from affect
- 仁 loses something in any single English rendering
- 成心 (chéngxīn) = "completed mind" / fixed perspective (Zhuangzi)
- 遊 (yóu) = wandering (Zhuangzi's positive response to perspectivalism)
